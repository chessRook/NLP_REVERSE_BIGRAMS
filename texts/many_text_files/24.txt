 list of illustrations      oh  what a pity   said betty from the heart   that we aren t  introduced now         ah  don t be cross   she said       betty stared at him coldly       betty looked nervously around  the scene was agitatingly unfamiliar       unfinished  but a disquieting likeness        no  thank you  it s all done now        on the further arm of the chair sat  laughing also  a very pretty  young woman       the next morning brought him a letter            book     the girl          chapter i       the inevitable      no  the chemises aren t cut out  i haven t had time  there are enough  shirts to go on with  aren t there  mrs  james   said betty      we can make do for this afternoon  miss  but the men they re getting  blowed out with shirts  it s the children s shifts as we can t make  shift without much longer   mrs  james  habitually doleful  punctuated  her speech with sniffs      that s a joke  mrs  james   said betty   how clever you are       i try to be what s fitting   said mrs  james  complacently      talk of fitting   said betty   if you like i ll fit on that black  bodice for you  mrs  symes  if the other ladies don t mind waiting for  the reading a little bit       i d as lief talk as read  myself   said a red faced sandy haired  woman   books ain t what they was in my young days       if it s the same to you  miss   said mrs  symes in a thick rich  voice   i ll not be tried on afore a room full  if we are poor we can  all be clean s what i say  and i keeps my unders as i keeps my  outside  but not before persons as has real imitation lace on their  petticoat bodies  i see them when i was a nursing her with her fourth   no  miss  and thanking you kindly  but begging your pardon all the  same       don t mention it   said betty absently   oh  mrs  smith  you can t  have lost your thimble already  why what s that you ve got in your  mouth       so it is   mrs  smith s face beamed at the gratifying coincidence   it  always was my habit  from a child  to put things there for safety       these cheap thimbles ain t fit to put in your mouth  no more than  coppers   said mrs  james  her mouth full of pins      oh  nothing hurts you if you like it   said betty recklessly  she had  been reading the works of mr  g k  chesterton     a shocked murmur arose      oh  miss  what about the publy kows   said mrs  symes heavily  the  others nodded acquiescence      don t you think we might have a window open   said betty  the may  sunshine beat on the schoolroom windows  the room  crowded with the  stout members of the  mother s meeting and mutual clothing club   was  stuffy  unbearable     a murmur arose far more shocked than the first      i was just a goin  to say why not close the door  that being what  doors is made for  after all   said mrs  symes   i feel a sort of  draught a creeping up my legs as it is      the door was shut      you can t be too careful   said the red faced woman   we never know  what a chill mayn t bring forth  my cousin s sister in law  she had  twins  and her aunt come in and says she   you re a bit stuffy here   ain t you   and with that she opens the window a crack   not meaning  no harm  miss   as it might be you  and within a year that poor  unfortunate woman she popped off  when least expected  gas ulsters   the doctor said  which it s what you call chills  if you re a doctor  and can t speak plain       my poor grandmother come to her end the same way   said mrs  smith    only with her it was the bible reader as didn t shut the door through  being so set on shewing off her reading  and my granny  a clot of  blood went to her brain  and her brain went to her head and she was a  corpse inside of fifty minutes      every woman in the room was waiting  feverishly alert  for the pause  that should allow her to begin her own detailed narrative of disease     mrs  james was easily first in the competition      them quick deaths   she said   is sometimes a blessing in disguise to  both parties concerned  my poor husband  years upon years he lingered   and he had a bad leg  talk of bad legs  i wish you could all have seen  it   she added generously      was it the kind that keeps all on a breaking out   asked mrs  symes  hastily   because my youngest brother had a leg that nothing couldn t  stop  break out it would do what they might  i m sure the bandages  i ve took off him in a morning       betty clapped her hands     it was the signal that the reading was going to begin  and the matrons  looked at her resentfully  what call had people to start reading when  the talk was flowing so free and pleasant     betty  rather pale  began   this is a story about a little boy called  wee willie winkie       i call that a silly sort of name   whispered mrs  smith      did he make a good end  miss   asked mrs  james plaintively      you ll see   said betty      i like it best when they dies forgiving of everybody and singing  hymns to the last       and when they says   mother  i shall meet you  ereafter in the better  land   that s what makes you cry so pleasant       do you want me to read or not   asked betty in desperation      yes  miss  yes   hummed the voices heavy and shrill      it s her hobby  poor young thing   whispered mrs  smith   we all  as   em  my own is a light cake to my tea  and always was  ush      betty read     when the mothers had wordily gone  she threw open the windows  propped  the door wide with a chair  and went to tea  she had it alone      your pa s out a parishing   said letitia  bumping down the tray in  front of her      that s a let off anyhow   said betty to herself  and she propped up a  stevenson against the tea pot     after tea parishioners strolled up by ones and twos and threes to  change their books at the vicarage lending library  the books were  covered with black calico  and smelt of rooms whose windows were never  opened     when she had washed the smell of the books off  she did her hair very  carefully in a new way that seemed becoming  and went down to supper     her step father only spoke once during the meal  he was luxuriating in  the thought of the  summa theologiae  of aquinas in leather still  brown and beautiful  which he had providentially discovered in the  wash house of an ailing parishioner  when he did speak he said      how extremely untidy your hair is  lizzie  i wish you would take more  pains with your appearance      when he had withdrawn to his books she covered three new volumes for  the library  the black came off on her hands  but anyway it was clean  dirt     she went to bed early      and that s my life   she said as she blew out the candle     said mrs  james to mrs  symes over the last and strongest cup of tea      miss betty s ailing a bit  i fancy  looked a bit peaky  it seemed to  me  i shouldn t wonder if she was to go off in a decline like her  father did       it wasn t no decline   said mrs  symes  dropping her thick voice     e was cut off in the midst of his wicked courses  a judgment if  ever there was one      betty s blameless father had been killed in the hunting field      i daresay she takes after him  only being a female it all turns to  her being pernickety in her food and allus wanting the windows open   and mark my words  it may turn into a decline yet  mrs  symes  my  dear      mrs  symes laughed fatly   that ain t no decline   she said   you take  it from me  what miss betty wants is a young man  it is but nature  after all  and what we must all come to  gentle or simple  give her a  young man to walk out with and you ll see the difference  decline  indeed  a young man s what she wants  and if i know anything of gells  and their ways she ll get one  no matter how close the old chap keeps  her      mrs  symes was not so wrong as the delicate minded may suppose     betty did indeed desire to fall in love  in all the story books the  main interest of the heroine s career began with that event  not that  she voiced the desire to herself  only once she voiced it in her  prayers      oh  god   she said   do please let something happen      that was all  a girl had her little reticences  even with herself   even with her creator     next morning she planned to go sketching  but no  there were three  more detestable books to be put into nasty little black cotton coats   the drawing room to be dusted  all the hateful china  the peas to be  shelled for dinner     she shelled the peas in the garden  it was a beautiful green garden   and lovers could have walked very happily down the lilac bordered  paths      oh  how sick i am of it all   said betty  she would not say  even to  herself  that what she hated was the frame without the picture     as she carried in the peas she passed the open window of the study  where  among shelves of dull books and dusty pamphlets  her  step father had as usual forgotten his sermon in a chain of references  to the fathers  betty saw his thin white hairs  his hard narrow face  and tight mouth  the hands yellow and claw like that gripped the thin  vellum folio      i suppose even he was young once   she said   but i m sure he doesn t  remember it      he saw her go by  young and alert in the sunshine  and the may air  stirred the curtains  he looked vaguely about him  unlocked a drawer  in his writing table  and took out a leather case  he gazed long at  the face within  a young bright face with long ringlets above the  formal bodice and sloping shoulders of the sixties      well  well   he said   well  well   locked it away  and went back to   de poenis parvulorum       i  will  go out   said betty  as she parted with the peas   i don t  care      it was not worth while to change one s frock  even when one was  properly dressed  at rare local garden party or flower show  one never  met anyone that mattered     she fetched her sketching things  at eighteen one does so pathetically  try to feed the burgeoning life with the husks of polite  accomplishment  she insisted on withholding from the clutches of the  parish the time to practise beethoven and sullivan for an hour daily   daily  for half an hour  she read an improving book  just now it was  the french revolution  and betty thought it would last till she was  sixty  she tried to read french and german  telemaque and maria  stuart  she fully intended to become all that a cultured young woman  should be  but self improvement is a dull game when there is no one to  applaud your score     what the gardener called the gravel path was black earth  moss grown   very pretty  but betty thought it shabby     it was soft and cool  though  to the feet  and the dust of the white  road sparkled like diamond dust in the sunlight     she crossed the road and passed through the swing gate into the park   where the grass was up for hay  with red sorrel and buttercups and  tall daisies and feathery flowered grasses  their colours all tangled  and blended together like ravelled ends of silk on the wrong side of  some great square of tapestry  here and there in the wide sweep of  tall growing things stood a tree  a may tree shining like silver  a  laburnum like fine gold  there were horse chestnuts whose spires of  blossom shewed like fat candles on a christmas tree for giant  children  and the sun was warm and the tree shadows black on the  grass     betty told herself that she hated it all  she took the narrow  path  the grasses met above her feet  crossed the park  and reached  the rabbit warren  where the chalk breaks through the thin dry turf   and the wild thyme grows thick     a may bush  overhanging a little precipice of chalk  caught her eye  a  wild rose was tangled round it  it was  without doubt  the most  difficult composition within sight      i will sketch that   said eighteen  confidently     for half an hour she busily blotted and washed and niggled  then she  became aware that she no longer had the rabbit warren to herself      and he s an artist  too   said betty   how awfully interesting  i  wish i could see his face      but this his slouched panama forbade  he was in white  the sleeve and  breast of his painting jacket smeared with many colours  he had a  camp stool and an easel and looked  she could not help feeling  much  more like a real artist than she did  hunched up as she was on a  little mound of turf  in her shabby pink gown and that hateful garden  hat with last year s dusty flattened roses in it     she went on sketching with feverish unskilled fingers  and a pulse  that had actually quickened its beat     she cast little glances at him as often as she dared  he was certainly  a real artist  she could tell that by the very way he held his  palette  was he staying with people about there  should she meet him   would they ever be introduced to each other      oh  what a pity   said betty from the heart   that we aren t  introduced  now       her sketch grew worse and worse      it s no good   she said   i can t do anything with it      she glanced at him  he had pushed back the hat  she saw quite plainly  that he was smiling  a very little  but he  was  smiling  also he was  looking at her  and across the fifteen yards of gray turf their eyes  met  and she knew that he knew that this was not her first glance at  him     she paled with fury      he has been watching me all the time  he is making fun of me  he  knows i can t sketch  of course he can see it by the silly way i hold  everything   she ran her knife around her sketch  detached it  and  tore it across and across     the stranger raised his hat and called eagerly      i say  please don t move for a minute  do you mind  i ve just got  your pink gown  it s coming beautifully  between brother artists  do   please  do sit still and go on sketching  ah  do      betty s attitude petrified instantly  she held a brush in her hand   and she looked down at her block  but she did not go on sketching  she  sat rigid and three delicious words rang in her ears   between brother  artists   how very nice of him  he hadn t been making fun  after all   but wasn t it rather impertinent of him to put her in his picture  without asking her  well  it wasn t she but her pink gown he wanted   and  between brother artists   betty drew a long breath      it s no use   he called   don t bother any more  the pose is gone      she rose to her feet and he came towards her      let me see the sketch   he said   why did you tear it up   he fitted  the pieces together   why  it s quite good  you ought to study in  paris   he added idly     she took the torn papers from his hand with a bow  and turned to go      don t go   he said   you re not going  don t you want to look at my  picture      now betty knew as well as you do that you musn t speak to people  unless you ve been introduced to them  but the phrase  brother  artists  had played ninepins with her little conventions      thank you  i should like to very much   said betty   i don t care    she said to herself   and besides  it s not as if he were a young man   or a tourist  or anything  he must be ever so old  thirty  i shouldn t  wonder if he was thirty five      when she saw the picture she merely said   oh   and stood at gaze  for  it  was  a picture  a picture that  seen in foreign lands  might well  make one sick with longing for the dry turf and the pale dog violets  that love the chalk  for the hum of the bees and the scent of the  thyme  he had chosen the bold sweep of the brown upland against the  sky  and low to the left  where the line broke  the dim violet of the  kentish hills  in the green foreground the pink figure  just roughly  blocked in  was blocked in by a hand that knew its trade  and was  artist to the tips of its fingers      oh   said betty again      yes   said he   i think i ve got it this time  i think it ll make a  hole in the wall  eh  yes  it is good       yes   said betty   oh  yes       do you often go a sketching   he asked      how modest he is   thought betty   he changes the subject so as not  to seem to want to be praised      aloud she answered with shy fluttered earnestness   yes  no  i don t  know  sometimes      his lips were grave  but there was the light behind his eyes that goes  with a smile      what unnecessary agitation   he was thinking   poor little thing  i  suppose she s never seen a man before  oh  these country girls   aloud  he was saying   this is such a perfect country  you ought to sketch  every day       i ve no one to teach me   said betty  innocently phrasing a long felt  want     the man raised his eyebrows   well  after that  here goes   he said to  himself   i wish you d let  me  teach you   he said to her  beginning  to put his traps together      oh  i didn t mean that   said betty in real distress  what would he  think of her  how greedy and grasping she must seem   i didn t mean  that at all       no  but i do   he said      but you re a great artist   said betty  watching him with clasped  hands   i suppose it would be  i mean  don t you know  we re not rich   and i suppose your lessons are worth pounds and pounds       i don t give lessons for money   his lips tightened   only for love       that means nothing  doesn t it   she said  and flushed to find  herself on the defensive feebly against  nothing      at tennis  yes   he said  and to himself he added    vieux jeu   my  dear  but you did it very prettily       but i couldn t let you give me lessons for nothing       why not   he asked  and his calmness made betty feel ashamed and  sordid      i don t know   she answered tremulously   but i don t think my  step father would want me to       you think it would annoy him       i m sure it would  if he knew about it      betty was thinking how little her step father had ever cared to know  of her and her interests  but the man caught the ball as he saw it      then why let him know   was the next move  and it seemed to him that  betty s move of rejoinder came with a readiness born of some practice  at the game      oh   she said innocently   i never thought of that  but wouldn t it  be wrong       she s got the whole thing stereotyped  but it s dainty type anyhow    he thought   of course it wouldn t be wrong   he said   it wouldn t  hurt him  don t you know that nothing s wrong unless it hurts  somebody       yes   she said eagerly   that s what i think  but all the same it  doesn t seem fair that you should take all that trouble for me and get  nothing in return       well played  we re getting on   he thought  and added aloud   but  perhaps i shan t get nothing in return      her eyes dropped over the wonderful thought that perhaps she might do  something for  him   but what  she looked straight at him  and the  innocent appeal sent a tiny thorn of doubt through his armour of  complacency  was she  after all  no  no novice could play the game so  well  and yet       i would do anything i could  you know   she said eagerly   because it  is so awfully kind of you  and i do so want to be able to paint  what  can i do       what can you do   he asked  and brought his face a little nearer to  the pretty flushed freckled face under the shabby hat  her eyes met  his  he felt a quick relenting  and drew back      well  for one thing you could let me paint your portrait      betty was silent      come  play up  you little duffer   he urged inwardly     when she spoke her voice trembled      i don t know how to thank you   she said      and you will       oh  i will  indeed i will       how good and sweet you are   he said  then there was a silence     betty tightened the strap of her sketching things and said      i think i ought to go home now      he had the appropriate counter ready      ah  don t go yet   he said   let us sit down  see  that bank is quite  in the shade now  and tell me        tell you what   she asked  for he had made the artistic pause      oh  anything  anything about yourself      betty was as incapable of flight as any bird on a limed twig     she walked beside him to the bank  and sat down at his bidding  and he  lay at her feet  looking up into her eyes  he asked idle questions   she answered them with a conscientious tremulous truthfulness that  showed to him as the most finished art  and it seemed to him a very  fortunate accident that he should have found here  in this unlikely  spot  so accomplished a player at his favorite game  yet it was the  variety of his game for which he cared least  he did not greatly  relish a skilled adversary  betty told him nervously and in words  ill chosen everything that he asked to know  but all the while the  undercurrent of questions rang strong within her   when is he to teach  me  where  how    so that when at last there was left but the bare  fifteen minutes needed to get one home in time for the midday dinner  she said abruptly      and when shall i see you again       you take the words out of my mouth   said he  and indeed she had    she has no  finesse  yet   he told himself   she might have left that  move to me       the lessons  you know   said betty   and  and the picture  if you  really do want to do it       if i want to do it   you know i want to do it  yes  it s like the  nursery game  how  when and where  well  as to the how  i can paint  and you can learn  the where  there s a circle of pines in the wood  here  you know it  a sort of giant fairy ring      she did know it      now for the when  and that s the most important  i should like to  paint you in the early morning when the day is young and innocent and  beautiful  like  like    he was careful to break off in a most natural  seeming embarrassment   that s a bit thick  but she ll swallow it all  right  gone down  right   he told himself      i could come out at six if you liked  or  or five   said betty   humbly anxious to do her part     he was almost shocked   my good child   he told her silently   someone  really ought to teach you not to do all the running  you don t give a  man a chance       then will you meet me here to morrow at six   he said   you won t  disappoint me  will you   he added tenderly      no   said downright betty   i ll be sure to come  but not to morrow    she added with undisguised regret   to morrow s sunday       monday then   said he   and good bye       good bye  and  oh  i don t know how to thank you       i m very much mistaken if you don t   he said as he stood bareheaded   watching the pink gown out of sight      well  adventures to the adventurous  a clergyman s daughter  too  i  might have known it            chapter ii       the irresistible     betty had to run all the way home  and then she was late for dinner   her step father s dry face and dusty clothes  the solid comfort of the  mahogany furnished dining room  the warm wet scent of mutton   these  seemed needed to wake her from what was  when she had awakened  a  dream  the open sky  the sweet air of the may fields and  him    already the stranger was him to betty  but  then  she did not know his  name     she slipped into her place at the foot of the long white dining table   a table built to serve a dozen guests  and where no guests ever sat   save rarely a curate or two  and more rarely even  an aunt      you are late again  lizzie   said her step father      yes  father   said she  trying to hide her hands and the fact that  she had not had time to wash them  a long streak of burnt sienna  marked one finger  and her nails had little slices of various colours  in them  her paint box was always hard to open     usually mr  underwood saw nothing  but when he saw anything he saw  everything  his eye was caught by the green smudge on her pink sleeve      i wish you would contrive to keep yourself clean  or else wear a  pinafore   he said     betty flushed scarlet      i m very sorry   she said   but it s only water colour  it will wash  out       you are nearly twenty  are you not   the vicar inquired with the dry  smile that always infuriated his step daughter  how was she to know  that it was the only smile he knew  and that smiles of any sort had  long grown difficult to him      eighteen   she said      it is almost time you began to think about being a lady      this was badinage  no failures had taught the reverend cecil that his  step daughter had an ideal of him in which badinage had no place  she  merely supposed that he wished to be disagreeable     she kept a mutinous silence  the old man sighed  it is one s duty to  correct the faults of one s child  but it is not pleasant  the  reverend cecil had not the habit of shirking any duty because he  happened to dislike it     the mutton was taken away     betty  her whole being transfigured by the emotions of the morning   stirred the stewed rhubarb on her plate  she felt rising in her a sort  of wild forlorn courage  why shouldn t she speak out  her step father  couldn t hate her more than he did  whatever she said  he might even  be glad to be rid of her  she spoke suddenly and rather loudly before  she knew that she had meant to speak at all      father   she said   i wish you d let me go to paris and study art   not now   she hurriedly explained with a sudden vision of being taken  at her word and packed off to france before six o clock on monday  morning   not now  but later  in the autumn perhaps  i would work very  hard  i wish you d let me      he put on his spectacles and looked at her with wistful kindness  she  read in his glance only a frozen contempt      no  my child   he said   paris is a sink of iniquity  i passed a week  there once  many years ago  it was at the time of the great  exhibition  you are growing discontented  lizzie  work is the cure for  that  mrs  symes tells me that the chemises for the mother s sewing  meetings are not cut out yet       i ll cut them out to day  they haven t finished the shirts yet   anyway   said betty   but i do wish you d just think about paris  or  even london       you can have lessons at home if you like  i believe there are  excellent drawing mistresses in sevenoaks  mrs  symes was recommending  one of them to me only the other day  with certificates from the high  school i seem to remember her saying       but that s not what i want   said betty with a courage that surprised  her as much as it surprised him   don t you see  father  one gets  older every day  and presently i shall be quite old  and i shan t have  been anywhere or seen anything      he thought he laughed indulgently at the folly of youth  she thought  his laugh the most contemptuous  the cruelest sound in the world   he  doesn t deserve that i should tell him about him   she thought   and i  won t  i don t care       no  no   he said   no  no  no  the home is the place for girls  the  safe quiet shelter of the home  perhaps some day your husband will  take you abroad for a fortnight now and then  if you manage to get a  husband  that is      he had seen  through his spectacles  her flushed prettiness  and old  as he was he remembered well enough how a face like hers would seem to  a young man s eyes  of course she would get a husband  so he spoke in  kindly irony  and she hated him for a wanton insult      try to do your duty in that state of life to which you are called    he went on   occupy yourself with music and books and the details of  housekeeping  no  don t have my study turned out   he added in haste   remembering how his advice about household details had been followed  when last he gave it   don t be a discontented child  go and cut out  the nice little chemises   this seemed to him almost a touch of kindly  humour  and he went back to augustine  pleased with himself     betty set her teeth and went  black rage in her heart  to cut out the  hateful little chemises     she dragged the great roll of evil smelling grayish unbleached calico  from the schoolroom cupboard and heaved it on to the table  it was  very heavy  the scissors were blunt and left deep red blue  indentations on finger and thumb  she was rather pleased that the  scissors hurt so much      father doesn t care a single bit  he hates me   she said   and i hate  him  oh  i do      she would not think of the morning  not now  with this fire of  impotent resentment burning in her  would she take out those memories  and look at them  those were not thoughts to be dragged through the  litter of unbleached cotton cuttings  she worked on doggedly   completed the tale of hot heavy little garments  gathered up the  pieces into the waste paper basket and put away the roll     not till the paint had been washed from her hands  and the crumbled  print dress exchanged for a quite respectable muslin did she  consciously allow the morning s memories to come out and meet her  eyes  then she went down to the arbour where she had shelled peas only  that morning      it seems years and years ago   she said  and sitting there  she  slowly and carefully went over everything  what he had said  what she  had said  there were some things she could not quite remember  but she  remembered enough   brother artists  were the words she said oftenest  to herself  but the words that sank themselves were   young and  innocent and beautiful like  like        but he couldn t have meant me  of course   she told herself     and on monday she would see him again   and he would give her a  lesson     sunday was incredibly wearisome  her sunday school class had never  been so tiresome nor so soaked in hair oil  in church she was shocked  to find herself watching  from her pew in the chancel  the entry of  late comers  of whom he was not one  no afternoon had ever been half  so long  she wrote up her diary  thursday and friday were quickly  chronicled  at  saturday  she paused long  pen in hand  and then wrote  very quickly   i went out sketching and met a gentleman  an artist  he  was very kind and is going to teach me to paint and he is going to  paint my portrait  i do not like him particularly  he is rather old   and not really good looking  i shall not tell father  because he is  simply hateful to me  i am going to meet this artist at   to morrow   it will be dreadful having to get up so early  i almost wish i hadn t  said i would go  it will be such a bother      then she hid the diary in a drawer  under her confirmation dress and  veil  and locked the drawer carefully     he was not at church in the evening either  he had thought of it  but  decided that it was too much trouble to get into decent clothes      i shall see her soon enough   he thought   curse my impulsive  generosity  six o clock  forsooth  and all to please a clergyman s  daughter      she came back from church with tired steps      i do hope i m not going to be ill   she said   i feel so odd  just as  if i hadn t had anything to eat for days   and yet i m not a bit  hungry either  i daresay i shan t wake up in time to get there by  six      she was awake before five     she woke with a flutter of the heart  what was it  had anything  happened  was anyone ill  then she recognized that she was not  unhappy  and she felt more than ever as though it were days since she  had had anything to eat      oh  dear   said betty  jumping out of bed   i m going out  to meet  him  and have a drawing lesson      she dressed quickly  it was too soon to start  not for anything must  she be first at the rendezvous  even though it were only for a  drawing lesson  that  only  pulled her up sharply     when she was dressed she dug out the diary and wrote        this is terrible  is it possible that i have fallen in love with    him  i don t know   who ever loved that loved not at first sight      it is a most frightful tragedy to happen to one  and at my age too     what a long life of loneliness stretches in front of me  for of    course he could never care for me  and if this  is  love  well  it    will be once and forever with me  i know        that s my nature  i m afraid  but i m not   i can t be  but i never    felt so unlike myself  i feel a sort of calm exultation  as if    something very wonderful was very near me  dear diary  what a    comfort it is to have you to tell everything to      it seemed to her that she must certainly be late  she had to creep  down the front stairs so very slowly and softly in order that she  might not awaken her step father  she had so carefully and silently to  unfasten a window and creep out  to close the window again  without  noise  lest the maids should hear and come running to see why their  young mistress was out of her bed at that hour  she had to go on  tiptoe through the shrubbery and out through the church yard  one  could climb its wall  and get into the park that way  so as not to  meet labourers on the road who would stare to see her alone so early  and perhaps follow her     once in the park she was safe  her shoes and her skirts were wet with  dew  she made haste  she did not want to keep him waiting     but she was first at the rendezvous  after all     she sat down on the carpet of pine needles  how pretty the early  morning was  the sunlight was quite different from the evening  sunlight  so much lighter and brighter  and the shadows were  different  she tried to settle on a point of view for her sketch  the  sketch he was to help her with     her thoughts went back to what she had written in her diary  if that   should  be true she must be very  very careful  he must never guess  it  never  she would be very cold and distant and polite  not  hail fellow well met with a  brother artist   like she had been  yesterday  it was all very difficult indeed  even if it really did  turn out to be true  if the wonderful thing had happened to her  if  she really was in love she would not try a bit to make him like her   that would be forward and  horrid   she would never try to attract any  man  those things must come of themselves or not at all     she arranged her skirt in more effective folds  and wondered how it  would look as one came up the woodland path  she thought it would look  rather picturesque  it was a nice heliotrope colour  it would look  like a giant parma violet against the dark green background  she hoped  her hair was tidy  and that her hat was not very crooked  however  little one desires to attract  one may at least wish one s hat to be  straight     she looked for the twentieth time at her watch  the serviceable silver  watch that had been her mother s  half past six  and he had not come     well  when he did come she would pretend she had only just got there   or how would it be if she gave up being a parma violet and went a  little way down the path and then turned back when she heard him  coming  she walked away a dozen yards and stood waiting  but he did  not come  was it possible that he was not coming  was he ill  lying  uncared for at the peal of bells in the village  with no one to smooth  his pillow or put eau de cologne on his head     she walked a hundred yards or so towards the village on the spur of  this thought     or perhaps he had come by another way to the trysting place  that  thought drove her back  he was not there     well  she would not stay any longer  she would just go away  and come  back ever so much later  and let him have a taste of waiting  she had  had her share  she told herself  as she almost ran from the spot  she  stopped suddenly  but suppose he did  not  wait  she went slowly back     she sat down again  schooled herself to patience     what an idiot she had been  like any school girl  of course he had  never meant to come  why should he  that page in her diary called out  to her to come home and burn it  care for him indeed  not she  why she  hadn t exchanged ten words with the man      but i knew it was all nonsense when i wrote it   she said   i only  just put it down to see what it would look like                                                  mr  eustace vernon roused himself  and yawned      it s got to be done  i suppose  buck up   you ll feel better after  your bath  jove  seven o clock  will she have waited  she s a keen  player if she has  it s just worth trying  i suppose      the church clock struck the half hour as he turned into the wood   something palely violet came towards him      so you  are  here   he said   where s the pink frock       it s  it s going to the wash   said a stiff and stifled voice   i m  sorry i couldn t get here at six  i hope you didn t wait long       not very long   he said  smiling   but  great heavens  what on earth  is the matter       nothing   she said      but you ve been  you are        i m not   she said defiantly    besides  i ve got neuralgia  it  always makes me look like that       my aunt   he thought   then she  was  here at six and  she s been  crying because i wasn t and  oh  where are we    i m so sorry you ve  got neuralgia   he said gently   but i m awfully glad you didn t get  here at six  because my watch was wrong and i ve only just got here   and i should never have forgiven myself if you d waited for me a  single minute  is the neuralgia better now       yes   she said  smiling faintly   much better  it was rather sharp  while it lasted  though       yes   he said   i see it was  i am so glad you did come  but i was so  certain you wouldn t that i didn t bring any of my traps  so we can t  begin the picture to day  will you start a sketch  or is your  neuralgia too bad      he knew it would be  and it was     so they merely sat on the pine carpet and talked till it was time for  her to go back to the late rectory breakfast  they told each other  their names that day  betty talked very carefully  it was most  important that he should think well of her  her manner had changed  as  she had promised herself it should do if she found she cared for him   now she was with him she knew  of course  that she did not care at  all  what had made her so wretched  no  so angry that she had actually  cried  was simply the idea that she had been made a fool of  that she  had kept the tryst and he hadn t  now he had come she was quite calm   she did not care in the least     he was saying to himself   i m not often wrong  but i was off the line  yesterday  all that doesn t count  we take a fresh deal and start  fair  she doesn t know the game   mais elle a des moyens   she s never  played the game before  and she cried because i didn t turn up  and so  i m the first  think of it  if you please  absolutely the first one   well  it doesn t detract from the interest of the game  it s quite a  different game and requires more skill  but not more than i have   perhaps      they parted with another tryst set for the next morning  the brother  artist note had been skilfully kept vibrating     betty was sure that she should never have any feeling for him but mere  friendliness  she was glad of that  it must be dreadful to be really  in love  so unsettling           chapter iii       voluntary     mr  eustace vernon is not by any error to be imagined as a villain of  the deepest dye  coldly planning to bring misery to a simple village  maiden for his own selfish pleasure  not at all  as he himself would  have put it  he meant no harm to the girl  he was a master of two  arts  and to these he had devoted himself wholly  one was the art of  painting  but one cannot paint for all the hours there are  in the  intervals of painting vernon always sought to exercise his other art   one is limited  of course  by the possibilities  but he liked to have  always at least one love affair on hand  and just now there were  none  none at least possessing the one charm that irresistibly drew  him  newness  the one or two affairs that dragged on merely meant  letter writing  and he hated writing letters almost as much as he  hated reading them     the country had been unfortunately barren of interest until his eyes  fell on that sketching figure in the pink dress  for he respected one  of his arts no less than the other  and would as soon have thought of  painting a vulgar picture as of undertaking a vulgar love affair  he  was no pavement artist  nor did he degrade his art by caricatures drawn  in hotel bars  dairy maids did not delight him  and the mood was rare  with him in which one finds anything to say to a little milliner  he  wanted the means  not the end  and was at one with the unknown sage  who said   the love of pleasure spoils the pleasure of love      there is a gift  less rare than is supposed  of wiping the slate clean  of memories  and beginning all over again  a certain virginity of soul  that makes each new kiss the first kiss  each new love the only love   this gift was vernon s  and he had cultivated it so earnestly  so  delicately  that except in certain moods when he lost his temper  and  with it his control of his impulses  he was able to bring even to a  conservatory flirtation something of the fresh emotion of a schoolboy  in love     betty s awkwardnesses  which he took for advances  had chilled him a  little  though less than they would have done had not one of the  evil tempered moods been on him     he had dreaded lest the affair should advance too quickly  his own  taste was for the first steps in an affair of the heart  the delicate  doubts  the planned misunderstandings  he did not question his own  ability to conduct the affair capably from start to finish  but he  hated to skip the dainty preliminaries  he had feared that with betty  he should have to skip them  for he knew that it is only in their  first love affairs that women have the patience to watch the flower  unfold itself  he himself was of infinite patience in that pastime  he  bit his lip and struck with his cane at the buttercup heads  he had  made a wretched beginning  with his  good and sweet   his  young and  innocent and beautiful like  like   if the girl had been a shade less  innocent the whole business would have been muffed  muffed hopelessly     to morrow he would be there early  a ship of promise should be  not  launched  that was weeks away  the first timbers should be felled to  build a ship to carry him  and her too  of course  a little way  towards the enchanted islands     he knew the sea well  and it would be pleasant to steer on it one to  whom it was all new  all  all      dear little girl   he said   i don t suppose she has ever even  thought of love      he was not in love with her  but he meant to be  he carefully thought  of her all that day  of her hair  her eyes  her hands  her hands were  really beautiful  small  dimpled and well shaped  not the hands he  loved best  those were long and very slender   but still beautiful   and before he went to bed he wrote a little poem  to encourage himself       yes  i have loved before  i know      this longing that invades my days       this shape that haunts life s busy ways    i know since long and long ago       this starry mystery of delight      that floats across my eager eyes       this pain that makes earth paradise     these magic songs of day and night       i know them for the things they are       a passing pain  a longing fleet       a shape that soon i shall not meet     a fading dream of veil and star       yet  even as my lips proclaim      the wisdom that the years have lent       your absence is joy s banishment    and life s one music is your name       i love you to the heart s hid core       those other loves  how can one learn      from marshlights how the great fires burn     ah  no  i never loved before     when he read it through he entitled it   the veil of maya   so that it  might pretend to have no personal application     after that more than ever rankled the memory of that first morning      how could i   he asked himself   i must indeed have been in a gross  mood  one seems sometimes to act outside oneself altogether  temporary  possession by some brutal ancestor perhaps  well  it s not too late      next morning he worked at his picture  in the rabbit warren  but his  head found itself turning towards the way by which on that first day  she had gone  she must know that on a day like this he would not be  wasting the light   that he would be working  she would be wanting to  see him again  would she come out  he wished she would  but he hoped  she wouldn t  it would have meant another readjustment of ideas  he  need not have been anxious  she did not come     he worked steadily  masterfully  he always worked best at the  beginning of a love affair  all of him seemed somehow more alive  more  awake  more alert and competent  his mood was growing quickly to what  he meant it to be  he was what actors call a quick study  soon he  would be able to play perfectly  without so much as a thought to the   book   the part of paul to this child s virginia     had virginia  he wondered  any relations besides the step father whom  she so light heartedly consented to hoodwink  relations who might  interfere and pray and meddle and spoil things     however ashamed we may be of our relations they cannot forever be  concealed  it must be owned that betty was not the lonely orphan she  sometimes pretended to herself to be  she had aunts  an accident that  may happen to the best of us     a year or two before betty was born  a certain youth of good birth  left harrow and went to ealing where he was received in a family in  the capacity of crammer s pup  the family was the crammer and his  daughter  a hard headed  tight mouthed  black haired young woman who  knew exactly what she wanted  and who meant to get it  poverty had  taught her to know what she wanted  nature  and the folly of  youth  not her own youth  taught her how to get it  there were several  pups  she selected the most eligible  secretly married him  and to the  day of her death spoke and thought of the marriage as a love match  he  was a dreamy youth  who wrote verses and called the crammer s daughter  his egeria  she was too clever not to be kind to him  and he adored  her and believed in her to the end  which came before his twenty first  birthday  he broke his neck out hunting  and died before betty was  born     his people  exasperated at the news of the marriage  threatened to try  to invalidate it on the score of the false swearing that had been  needed to get the boy of nineteen married to the woman of twenty four   egeria was frightened  she compromised for an annuity of two hundred  pounds  to be continued to her child     the passion of this woman s life was power  one cannot be very  powerful with just two hundred a year  and a doubtful position as the  widow of a boy whose relations are prepared to dispute one s marriage   mrs  desmond spent three years in thought  and in caring severely for  the wants of her child  then she bought four handsome dresses  and  some impressive bonnets  went to a hydropathic establishment  and  looked about her  of the eligible men there mr  cecil underwood  seemed  on enquiry  to be the most eligible  so she married him  he  resisted but little  for his parish needed a clergywoman sadly  the  two hundred pounds was a welcome addition to an income depleted by the  purchase of rare editions  and at the moment crippled by his recent  acquisition of the omiliac of vincentius in its original oak boards  and leather strings  and  above all  he saw in the three year old  betty the child he might have had if things had gone otherwise with  him and another when they both were young     mrs  desmond had felt certain she could rule a parish  mrs  cecil  underwood did rule it  as she had known she could  she ruled her  husband too  and betty  when she caught cold from working all day  among damp evergreens for the christmas decorations  and  developing  pneumonia  died  she died resentfully  thanking god that she had  always done her duty  and quite unable to imagine how the world would  go on without her  she felt almost sure that in cutting short her  career of usefulness her creator was guilty of an error of judgment  which he would sooner or later find reason to regret     her husband mourned her  he had the habit of her  of her strong  capable ways  the clockwork precision of her household and parish  arrangements  but as time went on he saw that perhaps he was more  comfortable without her  as a reformed drunkard sees that it is better  not to rely on brandy for one s courage  he saw it  but of course he  never owned it to himself     betty was heart broken  quite sincerely heart broken  she forgot all  the mother s hard tyrannies  her cramping rules  her narrow bitter  creed  and remembered only the calm competence  amounting to genius   with which her mother had ruled the village world  her unflagging  energy and patience  and her rare moments of tenderness  she  remembered too all her own lapses from filial duty  and those memories  were not comfortable     yet betty too  when the self tormenting remorseful stage had worn  itself out  found life fuller  freer without her mother  her  step father she hated  had always hated  but he could be avoided  she  went to a boarding school at torquay  and some of her holidays were  spent with her aunts  the sisters of the boy father who had not lived  to see betty     she adored the aunts  they lived in a world of which her village world  did not so much as dream  they spoke of things which folks at home  neither knew of nor cared for  and they spoke a language that was not  spoken at long barton  of course  everyone who was anyone at long  barton spoke in careful and correct english  but no one ever troubled  to turn a phrase  and irony would have been considered very bad form  indeed  aunt nina wore lovely clothes and powdered her still pretty  face  aunt julia smoked cigarettes and used words that ladies at long  barton did not use  betty was proud of them both     it was aunt nina who taught betty how to spend her allowance  how to  buy pretty things  and  better still  tried to teach her how to wear  them  aunt julia it was who brought her the indian necklaces  and  promised to take her to italy some day if she was good  aunt nina  lived in grosvenor square and aunt julia s address was most often   vaguely  the continent of europe  sometimes a letter addressed to some  odd place in asia or america would find her     but when betty had left school her visits to aunt nina ceased  mr   underwood feared that she was now of an age to be influenced by  trifles  and that london society would make her frivolous  besides he  had missed her horribly  all through her school days  though he had  yielded to the insistence of the aunts  but he had wanted betty badly   only of course it never occurred to him to tell her so     so betty had lived on at the rectory carrying on  with more or less of  success  such of her mother s parish workings as had managed to  outlive their author  and writing to the aunts to tell them how bored  she was and how she hated to be called  lizzie      she could not be expected to know that her stepfather had known as   lizzie  the girl who  if fate had been kind  would have been his wife  or the mother of his child  betty s letters breathed contempt of  parish matters  weariness of the dulness of the country  and  exasperation at the hardness of a lot where  nothing ever happened      well  something had happened now     the tremendous nature of the secret she was keeping against the world  almost took betty s breath away  it was to the adventure  far more  than to the man  that her heart s beat quickened  something had  happened     long barton was no longer the dullest place in the world  it was the  centre of the universe  see her diary  an entry following a gap where  a page had been torn out      mr  v  is very kind  he is teaching me to sketch  he says i shall do  very well when i have forgotten what i learned at school  it is so  nice of him to be so straightforward  i hate flattery  he has begun my  portrait  it is beautiful  but he says it is exactly like me  of  course it is his painting that makes it beautiful  and not anything to  do with me  that is not flattery  i do not think he could say anything  unless he really thought it  he is that sort of man  i think  i am so  glad he is so good  if he were a different sort of person perhaps it  would not be quite nice for me to go and meet him without any one  knowing  but there is nothing  of that sort   he was quite different  the first day  but i think then he was off his guard and could not  help himself  i don t know quite what i meant by that  but  anyway  i  am sure he is as good as gold  and that is such a comfort  i revere  him  i believe he is really noble and unselfish  and so few men are   alas      the noble and unselfish vernon meanwhile was quite happy  his picture  was going splendidly  and every morning he woke to the knowledge that  his image filled all the thoughts of a good little girl with gray dark  charming eyes and a face that reminded one of a pretty kitten  her  drawing was not half bad either  he was spared the mortifying labour  of trying to make a silk purse out of a sow s ear  in one of his arts  as in the other he decided that she had talent  and it was pleasant  that to him should have fallen the task of teacher in both  departments  those who hunt the fox will tell you that reynard enjoys   equally with the hounds and their masters  the pleasures of the chase   vernon was quite of this opinion in regard to his favourite sport  he  really felt that he gave as much pleasure as he took  and his own  forgettings were so easy that the easy forgetting of others seemed a  foregone conclusion  his forgetting always came first  that was all   but now  the spring  her charm and his own firm  parti pris  working  together  it seemed to him that he could never forget betty  could  never wish to forget her     her pretty conscious dignity charmed him  he stood still to look at  it  he took no step forward  his role was that of the deeply  respectful  brother artist   if his hand touched hers as he corrected  her drawing  that was accident  if  as he leaned over her  criticising  her work  the wind sent the end of her hair against his ear  that  could hardly be avoided in a breezy english spring  it was not his  fault that the little thrill it gave him was intensified a  hundred fold when  glancing at her  he perceived that her own ears had  grown scarlet     betty went through her days in a dream  there were all the duties she  hated  the mothers  meetings  the parish visits when she tried to  adjust the quarrels and calm the jealousies of the stout aggressive  mothers  the carrying round the parish magazine  there were no long  hours  now  in every spare moment she worked at her drawing to please  him  it was the least she could do  after all his kindness     her step father surprised her once hard at work with charcoal and  board and plumb line  a house maid posing for her with a broom  he  congratulated himself that his little sermon on the advantages of  occupation as a cure for discontent had borne fruit so speedy and so  sound      dear child  she only wanted a word in season   he thought  and he  said      i am glad to see that you have put away vain dreams  lizzie  and your  labours will not be thrown away  either  if you go on taking pains i  daresay you will be able to paint some nice blotting books and screens  for the school bazaar       i daresay   said betty  adding between her teeth   if you only knew       but we mustn t keep letitia from her work   he added  vaguely  conscientious  letitia flounced off  and betty  his back turned  tore  up the drawing     and  as a beautiful background to the gross realism of mothers   meetings and parish tiresomenesses  was always the atmosphere of the  golden mornings  the dew and the stillness  the gleam of his white  coat among the pine trees  for he was always first at the tryst now     betty was drunk  and she was too young to distinguish between  vintages  when she had been sober she had feared intoxication  now she  was drunk  she thanked heaven that she was sober           chapter iv       involuntary     six days of sunlight and clear air  of mornings as enchanting as  dreams  of dreams as full of magic as may mornings  then an  interminable sunday hot and sultry  with rolling purple clouds and an  evening of thunder and heavy showers  a magenta sunset  a night  working  hidden in its own darkness  its own secret purposes  and a  monday morning gray beyond belief  with a soft steady rain     betty stood for full five minutes looking out at the straight fine  fall  at the white mist spread on the lawn  the blue mist twined round  the trees  listening to the plash of the drops that gathered and fell  from the big wet ivy leaves  to the guggle of the water spout  the  hiss of smitten gravel      he ll never go   she thought  and her heart sank     he  shaving  in the chill damp air by his open dimity draped window   was saying      she ll be there  of course  women are all perfectly insensible to  weather      two mackintoshed figures met in the circle of pines      you have come   he said   i never dreamed you would  how cold your  hand is      he held it for a moment warmly clasped      i thought it might stop any minute   said betty   it seemed a pity to  waste a morning       yes   he said musingly   it would be a pity to waste a morning  i  would not waste one of these mornings for a kingdom      betty fumbled with her sketching things as a sort of guarantee of good  faith      but it s too wet to work   said she   i suppose i d better go home  again       that seems a dull idea  for me   he said   it s very selfish  of  course  but i m rather sad this morning  won t you stay a little and  cheer me up      betty asked nothing better  but even to her a tete a tete in a wood   with rain pattering and splashing on leaves and path and resonant  mackintoshes  seemed to demand some excuse      i should think breakfast and being dry would cheer you up better than  anything   said she   and it s very wet here       hang breakfast  but you re right about the wetness  there s a shed in  the field yonder  a harrow and a plough live there  they re sure to be  at home on a day like this  let s go and ask for their hospitality       i hope they ll be nice to us   laughed betty   it s dreadful to go  where you re not wanted       how do you know   he asked  laughing too   come  give me your hand  and let s run for it      they ran  hand in hand  the wet mackintoshes flapping and slapping  about their knees  and drew up laughing and breathless in the dry  quiet of the shed  vernon thought of love and mr  lewisham  but it was  not the moment to say so      see  they are quite pleased to see us   said he   they don t say a  word against our sheltering here  the plough looks a bit glum  but  she ll grow to like us presently  as for harrow  look how he s smiling  welcome at you with all his teeth       i m glad he can t come forward to welcome us   said betty   his teeth  look very fierce       he could  of course  only he s enchanted  he used to be able to move  about  but now he s condemned to sit still and only smile till  till  he sees two perfectly happy people  are you perfectly happy   he asked  anxiously      i don t know   said betty truly   are you       no  not quite perfectly       i m so glad   said betty   i shouldn t like the harrow to begin to  move while we re here  i m sure it would bite us      he sighed and looked grave   so you don t want me to be perfectly  happy      she looked at him with her head on one side      not here   she said   i can t trust that harrow      his eyelids narrowed over his eyes  then relaxed  no  she was merely  playing at enchanted harrows      are you cold still   he asked  and reached for her hand  she gave it  frankly      not a bit   she said  and took it away again   the run warmed me  in  fact       she unbuttoned the mackintosh and spread it on the bar of the plough  and sat down  her white dress lighted up the shadows of the shed   outside the rain fell steadily      may i sit down too  can mrs  plough find room for two children on her  lap      she drew aside the folds of her dress  but even then only a little  space was left  the plough had been carelessly housed and nearly half  of it was where the rain drove in on it  so that they were very close  together     so close that he had to throw his head back to see clearly how the  rain had made the short hair curl round her forehead and ears  and how  fresh were the tints of face and lips  also he had to support himself  by an arm stretched out behind her  his arm was not round her  but it  might just as well have been  as far as the look of the thing went  he  thought of the arm of mr  lewisham      did you ever have your fortune told   he asked      no  never  i ve always wanted to  but father hates gipsies  when i  was a little girl i used to put on my best clothes  and go out into  the lanes and sit about and hope the gipsies would steal me  but they  never did       they re a degenerate race  blind to their own interests  but they  haven t a monopoly of chances  fortunately   his eyes were on her  face      i never had my fortune told   said betty   i d love it  but i think i  should be afraid  all the same  something might come true      vernon was more surprised than he had ever been in his life at the  sudden involuntary movement in his right arm  it cost him a conscious  effort not to let the arm follow its inclination and fall across her  slender shoulders  while he should say      your fortune is that i love you  is it good or bad fortune      he braced the muscles of his arm  and kept it where it was  that  sudden unreasonable impulse was a mortification  an insult to the man  whose pride it was to believe that his impulses were always planned      i can tell fortunes   he said   when i was a boy i spent a couple of  months with some gipsies  they taught me lots of things      his memory  excellently trained  did not allow itself to dwell for an  instant on his reason for following those gipsies  on the dark eyed  black haired girl with the skin like pale amber  who had taught him   by the flicker of the camp fire  the lines of head and heart and life   and other things beside  oh  but many other things  that was before he  became an artist  he was only an amateur in those days      did they teach you how to tell fortunes  really and truly   asked  betty   we had a fortune teller s tent at the school bazaar last year   and the youngest smithson girl dressed up in spangles and a red dress  and said she was zara  the eastern mystic hand reader  and foreteller  of the future  but she got it all out of napoleon s book of fate       i don t get my fortune telling out of anybody s book of anything   he  said   i get it out of people s hands  and their faces  some people s  faces are their fortunes  you know       i know they are   she said a little sadly   but everybody s got a  hand and a fortune  whether they ve got that sort of fortune face or  not       but the fortunes of the fortune faced people are the ones one likes  best to tell       of course   she admitted wistfully   but what s going to happen to  you is just as interesting to  you   even if your face isn t  interesting to anybody  do you always tell fortunes quite truly  i  mean do you follow the real rules  or do you make up pretty fortunes  for the people with the pretty fortune faces       there s no need to  make up   the pretty fortunes are always there  for the pretty fortune faces  unless of course the hand contradicts  the face       but can it       can t it  there may be a face that all the beautiful things in the  world are promised to  just by being so beautiful itself it draws  beautiful happenings to it  but if the hand contradicts the face  if  the hand is one of those narrow niggardly distrustful hands  one of  the hands that will give nothing and take nothing  a hand without  courage  without generosity  well then one might as well be born  without a fortune face  for any good it will ever do one       then you don t care to tell fortunes for people who haven t fortune  faces       i should like to tell yours  if you would let me  shall i      he held out his hand  but her hand was withheld      i ought to cross your hand with silver  oughtn t i   she asked      it s considered correct  but        oh  don t let s neglect any proper precaution   she said   i haven t  got any money  tell it me to morrow  and i will bring a sixpence       you could cross my hand with your watch   he said   and i could take  the crossing as an i o u  of the sixpence      she detached the old watch  he held out his hand and she gravely  traced a cross on it      now   he said   all preliminary formalities being complied with  let  the prophet do his work  give me your hand  pretty lady  and the old  gipsy will tell you your fortune true      he held the hand in his  bending back the pink finger tips with his  thumb  and looked earnestly at its lines  then he looked in her face   longer than he had ever permitted himself to look  he looked till her  eyes fell  it was a charming picture  he was tall  strong  well built  and quite as good looking as a clever man has any need to be  and she  was as pretty as any oleograph of them all     it seemed a thousand pities that there should be no witness to such a  well posed tableau  no audience to such a charming scene  the pity of  it struck destiny  and destiny flashed the white of betty s dress  a  shrill point of light  into an eye a hundred yards away  the eye s  owner  with true rustic finesse  drew back into the wood s shadow   shaded one eye with a brown rustic hand  looked again  and began a  detour which landed the rustic boots  all silently  behind the shed   at a spot where a knot hole served as frame for the little picture   the rustic eye was fitted to the knot hole while vernon holding  betty s hand gazed in betty s face  and decided that this was no time  to analyse his sensations     neither heard the furtive rustic tread  or noted the gleam of the pale  rustic eye     the labourer shook his head as he hurried quickly away  he had  daughters of his own  and the rector had been kind when one of those  daughters had suddenly come home from service  ill  and with no  prospect of another place      a holdin  of hands and a castin  of sheep s eyes   said he   we knows  what that s the beginnings of  well  well  youth s the season for  silliness  but there s bounds  there s bounds  and all of a mornin  so  early too  lord above knows what it wouldn t be like of a evenin    he  shook his head again  and made haste     vernon had forced his eyes to leave the face of betty      your fortune   he was saying   is  curiously enough  just one of  those fortunes i was speaking of  you will have great chances of  happiness  if you have the courage to take them  you will cross the  sea  you ve never travelled  have you       no   never further than torquay  i was at school there  you know  and  london  of course  but i should love it  isn t it horrid to think that  one might grow quite old and never have been anywhere or done  anything       that depends on oneself  doesn t it  adventures are to the  adventurous       yes  that s all very well  girls can t be adventurous       yes   it s the prince who sets out to seek his fortune  isn t it  the  princess has to sit at home and wait for hers to come to her  it  generally does if she s a real princess       but half the fun must be the seeking for it   said betty      you re right   said he   it is      the labourer had reached the park gate  his pace had quickened to the  quickening remembrance of his own daughter  sitting at home silent and  sullen      do you really see it in my hand   asked betty    about my crossing  the sea  i mean       it s there  but it depends on yourself  like everything else       i did ask my step father to let me go   she said   after that first  day  you know  when you said i ought to study in paris       and he wouldn t  of course       no  he said paris was a wicked place  it isn t really  is it       every place is wicked   said he   and every place is good  it s all  as one takes things      the rectory gate clicked sharply as it swung to behind the labourer   the rectory gravel scrunched beneath the labourer s boots     yes  the master was up  he could be seen     the heavy boots were being rubbed against the birch broom that  rooted  at kentish back doors  stands to receive on its purple twigs the  scrapings of kentish clay from rustic feet      you have the artistic lines very strongly marked   vernon was saying    one  two  three  yes  painting  music perhaps       i am very fond of music   said betty  thinking of the hour s daily  struggle with the mikado and the moonlight sonata   but three arts   what could the third one be   her thoughts played for an instant with  unheard of triumphs achieved behind footlights  rapturous applause   showers of bouquets      whatever it is  you ve enormous talent for it   he said   you ll find  out what it is in good time  perhaps it ll be something much more  important than the other two put together  and perhaps you ve got even  more talent for it than you have for others       but there isn t any other talent that i can think of       i can think of a few  there s the stage   but it s not that  i fancy   or not exactly that  there s literature  confess now  don t you write  poetry sometimes when you re all alone at night  then there s the art  of being amusing  and the art of being  of being liked       shall i be successful in any of the arts       in one  certainly       ah   said betty   if i could only go to paris       it s not always necessary to go to paris for success in one s art    he said      but i want to go  i m sure i could do better there       aren t you satisfied with your present master       oh    it was a cry of genuine distress  of heartfelt disclaim   you   know  i didn t mean that  but you won t always be here  and when  you ve gone  why then       again he had to control the involuntary movement of his left arm      but i m not going for months yet  don t let us cross a bridge till we  come to it  your head line promises all sorts of wonderful things  and  your heart line    he turned her hand more fully to the light     in the rector s study the labourer was speaking  standing shufflingly  on the margin of the turkey carpet  the rector listened  his hand on  an open folio where fat infants peered through the ornamental  initials      and so i come straight up to you  sir  me being a father and you the  same  sir  for all the difference betwixt our ways in life  says i to  myself  says i  and bitter hard i feels it too  i says   george   says  i   you ve got a daughter as begun that way  not a doubt of  it  holdin  of hands and sittin  close alongside  and you know what s  come to her       the rector shivered at the implication      then i says  says i   like as not the rector won t thank you for  interferin   least said soonest mended   says i       i m very much obliged to you   said the rector difficultly  and his  hand shook on ambrosius s yellow page      you see  sir   the man s tone held all that deferent apology that  truth telling demands   gells is gells  be they never so up in the  world  all the world over  bless their hearts  and young men is young  men  d  n them  asking your pardon  sir  i m sure  but the word  slipped out  and i shouldn t ha  been easy if anything had have gone  wrong with miss  god bless her  all along of the want of a word in  season  asking your pardon  sir  but even young ladies is flesh and  blood  when it comes to the point  ain t they now   he ended  appealingly     the rector spoke with an obvious effort  got his hand off the page and  closed the folio      you ve done quite right  george   he said   and i m greatly obliged  to you  only i do ask you to keep this to yourself  you wouldn t have  liked it if people had heard a thing like that about your ruby  before  i mean when she was at home      he replaced the two folios on the shelf      not me  sir   george answered   i m mum  i do assure you  sir  and if  i might make so bold  you just pop on your hat and step acrost  directly minute  there s that little hole back of the shed what i told  you of  you ain t only got to pop your reverend eye to that there  and  you ll see for yourself as i ain t give tongue for no dragged scent       thank you  george   said the rector   i will  good morning  god bless  you      the formula came glibly  but it was from the lips only that it came     lizzie  his white innocent lily girl  in a shed  a man  a stranger   holding her hand  his arm around her  his eyes  his lips perhaps   daring      the rector was half way down his garden drive      your heart line   vernon was saying   it s a little difficult  you  will be deeply beloved      to have one s fortune told is disquieting  to keep silence during the  telling deepens the disquiet curiously  it seemed good to betty to  laugh      soldier  sailor  tinker  tailor   she said   which am i going to  marry  kind gipsy       i don t believe the gipsies who say they can see marriage in a hand    he answered gravely  and betty feared he had thought her flippant  or  even vulgar   what one sees are not the shadows of coming conventions   one sees the great emotional events  the things that change and mould  and develop character  yes  you will be greatly beloved  and you will  love deeply       i m not to be happy in my affairs of the heart then   still a careful  flippancy seemed best to betty      did i say so  do you really think that there are no happy love  affairs but those that end in a wedding breakfast and bridesmaids   with a bazaar show of hideous silver and still more hideous crockery   and all one s relations assembled to dissect one s most sacred  secrets      betty had thought so  but it seemed coarse to own it      can t you imagine   he went on dreamily   a love affair so perfect  that it could not but lose its finest fragrance if the world were  called to watch the plucking of love s flower  can t you imagine a  love so great  so deep  so tender  so absolutely possessing the whole  life of the lover that he would almost grudge any manifestation of it   because such a manifestation must necessarily be a repetition of some  of the ways in which unworthy loves have been manifested  by less  happy lovers  i can seem to see that one might love the one love of a  life time  and be content to hold the treasure in one s heart  a  treasure such as no other man ever had  and grudge even a word or a  look that might make it less the single perfect rose of the world       oh  dear   said betty to herself      but i m talking like a book   he said  and laughed   i always get  dreamy and absurd when i tell fortunes  anyway  as i said before  you  will be greatly beloved  indeed  unless your hand is very untruthful   which i m sure it never could be  you are beloved now  far more than  you can possibly guess      betty caught at her flippancy but it evaded her  and all she found to  say was   oh   and her eyes fell     there was a silence  vernon still held her hand  but he was no longer  looking at it     a black figure darkened the daylight     the two on the plough started up  started apart  nothing more was  wanted to convince the rector of all that he least wished to believe      go home  lizzie   he said   go to your room   and to her his face  looked the face of a fiend  it is hard to control the muscles under a  sudden emotion compounded of sorrow  sympathy and an immeasurable  pity   go to your room and stay there till i send for you      betty went  like a beaten dog     the rector turned to the young man      now  sir   he said           chapter v       the prisoner     when vernon looked back on that interview he was honestly pleased with  himself  he had been patient  he had been kind even  in the end he had  been positively chivalrous  he had hardly allowed himself to be  ruffled for an instant  but had met the bitter flow of mr  underwood s  biblical language with perfect courtesy     he regretted  of course  deeply  this unfortunate misunderstanding   accident had made him acquainted with miss desmond s talent  he had  merely offered her a little of that help which between brother  artists  the well worn phrase had not for the rector the charm it had  had for betty     the rector spoke again  and mr  vernon listened  bare headed  in  deepest deference     no  he had not been holding miss desmond s hand  he had merely been  telling her fortune  no one could regret more profoundly than he   and  so on  he was much wounded by mr  underwood s unworthy suspicions     the rector ran through a few texts  his pulpit denunciations of  iniquity  though always earnest  had lacked this eloquence     vernon listened quietly      i can only express my regret that my thoughtlessness should have  annoyed you  and beg you not to blame miss desmond  it was perhaps a  little unconventional  but        unconventional  to try to ruin       mr  vernon held up his hand  he was genuinely shocked      forgive me   he said   but i can t hear such words in connection  with  with a lady for whom i have the deepest respect  you are heated  now  sir  and i can make every allowance for your natural vexation   but i must ask you not to overstep the bounds of decency      the rector bit his lip  and vernon went on      i have listened to your abuse  yes  your abuse  without defending  myself  but i can t allow anyone  even her father  to say a word  against her       i am not her father   said the old man bitterly  and on the instant  vernon understood him as betty had never done  the young man s tone  changed instantly      look here   he said  and his face grew almost boyish   i am really  most awfully sorry  the whole thing  what there is of it  and it s  very little  was entirely my doing  it was inexcusably thoughtless   miss desmond is very young and very innocent  it is i who ought to  have known better   and perhaps i did  but the country is very dull   and it was a real pleasure to teach so apt a pupil      he spoke eagerly  and the ring of truth was in his voice  but the  rector felt that he was listening to the excuses of a serpent      then you d have me believe that you don t even love her       no more than she does me   said vernon very truly   i ve never  breathed a word of love to her   he went on   such an idea never  entered our heads  she s a charming girl  and i admire her immensely   but    he sought hastily for a weapon  and defended betty with the  first that came to hand   i am already engaged to another lady  it is  entirely as an artist that i am interested in miss betty       serpent   said the rector within himself   lying serpent      vernon was addressing himself silently in terms not more flattering    fool  idiot  brute to let the child in for this   for it s going to  be a hell of a time for her  anyhow  and as for me  well  the game is  up  absolutely up       i am really most awfully sorry   he said again      i find it difficult to believe in the sincerity of your repentance    said the rector frowning      my regret you may believe in   said vernon stiffly   there is no  ground for even the mention of such a word as repentance       if your repentance is sincere   he underlined the word   you will  leave long barton to day      leave without a word  a sign from betty  a word or a sign to her  it  might be best  if       i will go  sir  if you will let me have your assurance that you will  say nothing to miss desmond  that you won t make her unhappy  that  you ll let the whole matter drop       i will make no bargains with you   cried the rector   do your worst   thank god i can defend her from you       she needs no defence  it s not i who am lacking in respect and  consideration for her   said vernon a little hotly   but  as i say   i ll go  if you ll just promise to be gentle with her       i do not need to be taught my duty by a villain  sir     the old  clergyman was trembling with rage   i wish to god i were a younger  man  that i might chastise you for the hound you are   his upraised  cane shook in his hand   words are thrown away on you  i m sorry i  can t use the only arguments that can come home to a puppy       if you were a younger man   said vernon slowly   your words would not  have been thrown away on me  they would have had the answer they  deserved  i shall not leave long barton  and i shall see miss desmond  when and how i choose       long barton shall know you in your true character  sir  i promise  you       so you would blacken her to blacken me  one sees how it is that she  does not love her father      he meant to be cruel  but it was not till he saw the green shadows  round the old man s lips that he knew just how cruel he had been  the  quivering old mouth opened and closed and opened  the cold eyes  gleamed  and the trembling hand in one nervous movement raised the  cane and struck the other man sharply across the face  it was a  hysterical blow  like a woman s  and with it the tears sprang to the  faded eyes     then it was that vernon behaved well  when he thought of it afterwards  he decided that he had behaved astonishingly well     with the smart of that cut stinging on his flesh  the mark of it  rising red and angry across his cheek  he stepped back a pace  and  without a word  without a retaliatory movement  without even a change  of facial expression he executed the most elaborately courteous bow   as of one treading a minuet  recovered the upright and walked away  bareheaded  the old clergyman was left planted there  the cane still  jigging up and down in his shaking hand      a little theatrical  perhaps   mused vernon  when the cover of the  wood gave him leave to lay his fingers to his throbbing cheek   but  nothing could have annoyed the old chap more      however effective it may be to turn the other cheek  the turning of it  does not cool one s passions  and he walked through the wood angrier  than he ever remembered being  but the cool rain dripping from the  hazel and sweet chestnut leaves fell pleasantly on his uncovered head  and flushed face  before he was through the wood he was able to laugh   and the laugh was a real laugh  if rather a rueful one  vernon could  never keep angry very long      poor old devil   he said   he ll have to put a special clause in the  general confession next sunday  poor old devil  and poor little betty   and poorest me  because  however  we look at it  and however we may  have damn well bluffed over it  the game  is  up  absolutely up      when one has a definite end in view  marriage  let us say  or an  elopement   secret correspondences  the surmounting of garden walls   the bribery of servants  are in the picture  but in a small sweet  idyll  with no backbone of intention to it  these things are  inartistic  and vernon was  above and before all  an artist  he must  go away and he knew it  and his picture was not finished  could he  possibly leave that incomplete  the thought pricked sharply  he had  not made much progress with the picture in these last days  it had  been pleasanter to work at the portrait of betty  if he moved to the  next village  yes  that must be thought over     he spent the day thinking of that and of other things     the reverend cecil underwood stood where he was left till the man he  had struck had passed out of sight  then the cane slipped through his  hand and fell rattling to the ground  he looked down at it curiously   then he reached out both hands vaguely and touched the shaft of the  plough  he felt his way along it  and sat down  where they had sat   staring dully before him at the shadows in the shed  and at the steady  fall of the rain outside  betty s mackintosh was lying on the floor   he picked it up presently and smoothed out the creases  then he  watched the rain again     an hour had passed before he got stiffly up and went home  with her  cloak on his arm     yes  miss lizzie was in her room  had a headache  he sent up her  breakfast  arranging the food himself  and calling back the maid  because the tray lacked marmalade     then he poured out his own tea  and sat stirring it till it was cold     she was in her room  waiting for him to send for her  he must send for  her  he must speak to her  but what could he say  what was there to  say that would not be a cruelty  what was there to ask that would not  be a challenge to her to lie  as the serpent had lied      i am glad i struck him   the reverend cecil told himself again and  again    that  brought it home to him  he was quite cowed  he could do  nothing but bow and cringe away  yes  i am glad      but the girl  the serpent had asked him to be gentle with her  had  dared to ask him  he could think of no way gentle enough for dealing  with this crisis  the habit of prayer caught him  he prayed for  guidance     then quite suddenly he saw what to do      that will be best   he said   she will feel that less      he rang and ordered the fly from the peal of bells  went to his room  to change his old coat for a better one  since appearances must be  kept up  even if the heart be breaking  his thin hair was disordered   and his tie  he noticed  was oddly crumpled  as though strange hands  had been busy with his throat  he put on a fresh tie  smoothed his  hair  and went down again  as he passed  he lingered a moment outside  her door     betty watching with red eyes and swollen lips saw him enter the fly   saw him give an order  heard the door bang  the old coachman clambered  clumsily to his place  and the carriage lumbered down the drive      oh  how cruel he is  he might have spoken to me  now   i suppose he s  going to keep me waiting for days  as a penance  and i haven t really  done anything wrong  it s a shame  i ve a good mind to run away      running away required consideration  in the meantime  since he was out  of the house  there was no reason why she should not go downstairs   she was not a child to be kept to her room in disgrace  she bathed her  distorted face  powdered it  and tried to think that the servants   should they see her  would notice nothing     where had he gone  for no goal within his parish would a hired  carriage be needed  he had gone to sevenoaks or to the station   perhaps he had gone to westerham  there was a convent there  a  protestant sisterhood  perhaps he was going to make arrangements for  shutting her up there  never   betty would die first  at least she  would run away first  but where could one run to     the aunts  betty loved the aunts  but she distrusted their age  they  were too old to sympathise really with her  they would most likely  understand as little as her step father had done  an inward monitor  told betty that the story of the fortune telling  of the seven stolen  meetings with no love making in them  would sound very unconvincing to  any ears but those of the one person already convinced  but she would  not be shut up in a convent  no  not by fifty aunts and a hundred  step fathers     she would go to him  he would understand  he was the only person who  ever had understood  she would go straight to him and ask him what to  do  he would advise her  he was so clever  so good  so noble  whatever  he advised would be  right      trembling and in a cold white rage of determination  betty fastened on  her hat  found her gloves and purse  the mackintosh she remembered had  been left in the shed  she pictured her step father trampling fiercely  upon it as he told mr  vernon what he thought of him  she took her  golf cape     at the last moment she hesitated  mr  vernon would not be idle  what  would he be doing  suppose he should send a note  suppose he had  watched mr  underwood drive away and should come boldly up and ask for  her  was it wise to leave the house  but perhaps he would be hanging  about the church yard  or watching from the park for a glimpse of her   she would at least go out and see      i ll leave a farewell letter   she said   in case i never come back      she found her little blotting book  envelopes  but no paper  of  course  one can t with dignity write cutting farewells on envelopes   she tore a page from her diary      you have driven me to this   she wrote   i am going away  and in time  i shall try to forgive you all the petty meannesses and cruelties of  all these years  i know you always hated me  but you might have had  some pity  all my life i shall bear the marks on my soul of the bitter  tyranny i have endured here  now i am going away out into the world   and god knows what will become of me      she folded  enveloped  and addressed the note  stuck a long hat pin  fiercely through it  and left it  patent  speared to her pin cushion   with her step father s name uppermost      good bye  little room   she said   i feel i shall never see you  again      slowly and sadly she crossed the room and turned the handle of the  door  the door was locked     once  years ago  a happier man than the reverend cecil had been rector  of long barton  and in the room that now was betty s he had had iron  bars fixed to the two windows  because that room was the nursery                                                 that evening  after dinner  mr  vernon sat at his parlour window  looking idly along the wet bowling green to the belt of lilacs and the  pale gleams of watery sunset behind them  he had passed a disquieting  day  he hated to leave things unfinished  and now the idyll was ruined  and the picture threatened   and betty s portrait was not finished   and never would be      come in   he said  and his landlady heavily followed up her tap on  his door      a lady to see you  sir   said she with a look that seemed to him to  be almost a wink      a lady  to see me  good lord   said vernon  among all the thoughts of  the day this was the one thought that had not come to him      shall i show her in   the woman asked  and she eyed him curiously      a lady   he repeated   did she give her name       yes  sir  miss desmond  sir  shall i shew her in       yes  shew her in  of course   he answered irritably     and to himself he said      the devil            chapter vi       the criminal     if you have found yourself  at the age of eighteen  a prisoner in your  own bedroom you will be able to feel with betty  not otherwise  even  your highly strung imagination will be impotent to present to you the  ecstasy of rage  terror  resentment that fills the soul when locked  door and barred windows say  quite quietly  but beyond appeal   here  you are  and here  my good child  you stay      all the little familiar objects  the intimate associations of the  furniture of a room that has been for years your boudoir as well as  your sleeping room  all the decorations that you fondly dreamed gave to  your room a  cachet   the mark of a distinctive personality   these  are of no more comfort to you than would be strange bare stone walls  and a close unfamiliar iron grating     betty tried to shake the window bars  but they were immovable  she  tried to force the door open  but her silver buttonhook was an  insufficient lever  and her tooth brush handle broke when she pitted  it in conflict against the heavy  old fashioned lock  we have all read  how prisoners  outwitting their gaolers  have filed bars with their  pocket nail scissors  and cut the locks out of old oak doors with the  small blade of a penknife  betty s door was only of pine  but her  knife broke off short  and the file on her little scissors wore itself  smooth against the first unmoved bar     she paced the room like a caged lioness  we read that did the lioness  but know her strength her bars were easily shattered by one blow of  her powerful paw  betty s little pink paws were not powerful like the  lioness s  and when she tried to make them help her  she broke her  nails and hurt herself     it was this moment that letitia chose for rapping at the door      you can t come in  what is it   betty was prompt to say      mrs  edwardes s albert  miss  come for the maternity bag       it s all ready in the school room cupboard   betty called through the  door   number three      she resisted an impulse to say that she had broken the key in the lock  and to send for the locksmith  no  there should be no scandal at long  barton   at least not while she had to stay in it     she did not cry  she was sick with fury  and anger made her heart beat  as vernon had never had power to make it      i will be calm  i won t lose my head   she told herself again and  again  she drank some water  she made herself eat the neglected  breakfast  she got out her diary and wrote in it  in a handwriting  that was not betty s  and with a hand that shook like totter grass      what will become of me  what has become of  him   my step father must  have done something horrible to him  perhaps he has had him put in  prison  of course he couldn t do that in these modern times  like in  the french revolution  just for talking to some one he hadn t been  introduced to  but he may have done it for trespassing  or damage to  the crops  or something  i feel quite certain something has happened  to him  he would never have deserted me like this in my misery if he  were free  and i can do nothing to help him  nothing  how shall i live  through the day  how can i bear it  and this awful trouble has come  upon him just because he was kind to another artist  the world is  very  very  very cruel  i wish i were dead   she blotted the words and  locked away the book  then she burnt that farewell note and went and  sat in the window seat to watch for her step father s return     the time was long  at last he came  she saw him open the carriage door  and reach out a flat foot  feeling for the carriage step  he stepped  out  turned and thrust a hand back into the cab  was he about to hand  out a stern faced protestant sister  who would take her to westerham   and she would never be heard of again  betty set her teeth and waited  anxiously to see if the sister seemed strong  betty was  and she would  fight for her liberty  with teeth and nails if need were     it was no protestant sister to whom the reverend cecil had reached his  hand  it was only his umbrella  betty breathed again     well  now at least he ll come and speak to me  he must come himself   even  he  couldn t give the key to the servants and say   please go  and unlock miss lizzie and bring her down      betty would not move   i shall just stay here and pretend i didn t  know the door was locked   said she     but her impatience drove her back to the caged lioness walk and when  at last she heard the key turn in the door she had only just time to  spring to the window seat and compose herself in an attitude of  graceful defiance     it was thrown away     the door only opened wide enough to admit a dinner tray pushed in by a  hand she knew  then the door closed again     the same thing happened with tea and supper     it was not till after supper that betty  gazing out on the pale watery  sunset  found it blurred to her eyes  there was no more hope now  she  was a prisoner  if he was not a prisoner he ought to be  it was the  only thing that could excuse his silence  he might at least have gone  by the gate or waved a handkerchief  well  all was over between them   and betty was alone in the world  she had not cried all day  but now  she did cry                                                 vernon always prided himself on having a heart for any fate  but this  was one of the interviews that one would rather have avoided  all day  he had schooled himself to resignation  had almost reconciled himself  to the spoiling of what had promised to be a masterpiece  explications  with betty would brush the bloom off everything  yet he must play the  part well  but what part  oh  hang all meddlers      miss desmond   said the landlady  and he braced his nerves to meet a  tearful  an indignant or a desperate betty     but there was no betty to be met  no betty of any kind     instead  a short squarely built middle aged lady walked briskly into  the room  and turned to see the door well closed before she advanced  towards him     he bowed with indescribable emotions      mr  eustace vernon   said the lady  she wore a sensible short skirt  and square toed brown boots  her hat was boat shaped and her abundant  hair was screwed up so as to be well out of her way  her face was  square and sensible like her shoulders  and her boots  her eyes dark   clear and near sighted  she wore gold rimmed spectacles and carried a  crutch handled cane  no vision could have been less like betty     vernon bowed  and moved a chair towards her      thank you   she said  and took it   now  mr  vernon  sit down too   and let s talk this over like reasonable beings  you may smoke if you  like  it clears the brain      vernon sat down and mechanically took out a cigarette  but he held it  unlighted      now   said the square lady  leaning her elbows on the table and her  chin on her hands   i am betty s aunt       it is very good of you to come   said vernon helplessly      not at all   she briskly answered   now tell me all about it       there s nothing to tell   said vernon      perhaps it will clear the ground a little if i say at once that i  haven t come to ask your intentions  because of course you haven t  any  my reverend brother in law  on the other hand  insists that you  have  and that they are strictly dishonourable      vernon laughed  and drew a breath of relief      i fear mr  underwood misunderstood     he said   and        he is a born misunderstander   said miss julia desmond   now  i m  not  light your cigarette  man  you can give me one if you like  to  keep you in countenance  a light  thanks  now will you speak  or shall  i       you seem to have more to say than i  miss desmond       ah  that s because you don t trust me  in other words  you don t know  me  that s one of the most annoying things in life  to be really an  excellent sort  and to be quite unable to make people see it at the  first go off  well  here goes  my worthy brother in law finds you and  my niece holding hands in a shed       we were not   said vernon   i was telling her fortune        it s my lead now   interrupted the lady   your turn next  he being  what he is  to the pure all things are impure  you know  instantly  draws the most harrowing conclusions  hits you with a stick   by the  way  you behaved uncommonly well about that       thank you   said vernon  smiling a little  it is pleasant to be  appreciated      yes  really very decently  indeed  i daresay it wouldn t have hurt a  fly  but if you d been the sort of man he thinks you are  however  that s neither here nor there  he hits you with a stick  locks the  child into her room  what did you say       nothing   said vernon      all right  i didn t hear it  locks her in her room  and wires to my  sister  takes a carriage to sevenoaks to do it too  to avoid scandal   i happen to be at my sister s  on my way from cairo to norway  so i  undertake to run down  he meets me at the station  and wants me to go  straight home and blackguard betty  but i prefer to deal with  principals       you mean        i mean that i know as well as you do that whatever has happened has  been your doing and not that dear little idiot s  now  are you going  to tell me about it      he had rehearsed already a form of words in which  brother artists   should have loomed large  but now that he rose  shrugged his shoulders  and spoke  it was in words that had not been rehearsed      look here  miss desmond   said he   the fact is  you re right  i  haven t any intentions  certainly not dishonourable ones  but i was  frightfully bored in the country  and your niece is bored  too  more  bored than i am  no one ever understands or pities the boredom of the  very young   he added pensively      well       well  that s all there is to it  i liked meeting her  and she liked  meeting me       and the fortune telling  do you mean to tell me you didn t enjoy  holding the child s hand and putting her in a silly flutter       i deny the flutter   he said   but  well  yes  of course i enjoyed  it  you wouldn t believe me if i said i didn t       no   said she      i enjoyed it more than i expected to   he added with a frankness that  he had not meant to use   much more  but i didn t say a word of  love   only perhaps        only perhaps you made the idea of it underlie every word you did  speak  don t i know   said miss desmond   bless the man  i ve been  young myself       miss betty is very charming   said he   and  and if i hadn t met  her        if you hadn t met her some other man would  true  but i fancy her  father would rather it had been some other man       i didn t mean that in the least   said vernon with some heat   i  meant that if i hadn t met her she would have gone on being bored  and  so should i  don t think me a humbug  miss desmond  i am more sorry  than i can say that i should have been the means of causing her any  unhappiness        causing her unhappiness    poor little betty  poor little trusting  innocent silly little girl  that s about it  isn t it      it was so like it that he hotly answered      not in the least       well  well   said miss desmond   there s no great harm done  she ll  get over it  and more s been lost on market days  thanks      she lighted a second cigarette and sat very upright  the cigarette in  her mouth and her hands on the handle of her stick      you can t help it  of course  men with your coloured eyes never can   that green hazel  girls ought to be taught at school that it s a  danger signal  only  since your heart s not in the business any more  than her s is  as you say  you were both bored to death  i want to ask  you  as a personal favour to me  just to let the whole thing drop  let  the girl alone  go right away       it s an unimportant detail  and i m ashamed to mention it   said  vernon   but i ve got a picture on hand  i m painting a bit of the  warren       well  go to low barton and put up there and finish your precious  picture  you won t see betty again unless you run after her       to tell the truth   said vernon   i had already decided to let the  whole thing drop  i m ashamed of the trouble i ve caused her and  and  i ve taken rooms at low barton       upon my word   said miss desmond   you are the coldest lover i ve  ever set eyes on       i m not a lover   he answered swiftly   do you wish i were       for betty s sake  i m glad you aren t  but i think i should respect  you more if you weren t quite so arctic       i m not an incendiary  at any rate   said he   and that s something   with my coloured eyes  isn t it       well   she said   whatever your temperature is  i rather like you  i  don t wonder at betty in the least      vernon bowed      all i ask is your promise that you ll not speak to her again       i can t promise that  you know  i can t be rude to her  but i ll  promise not to go out of my way to meet her again   he sighed      as  yes  it is sad  all that time wasted and no rabbits caught    again miss desmond had gone unpleasantly near his thought  of course  he said      you don t understand me       near enough   said miss desmond   and now i ll go       let me thank you for coming   said vernon eagerly   it was more than  good of you  i must own that my heart sank when i knew it was miss  betty s aunt who honoured me with a visit  but i am most glad you  came  i never would have believed that a lady could be so reasonable  and  and        and gentlemanly   said the lady   yes   it s my brother in law who is  the old woman  poor dear  you see  mr  vernon  i ve been running round  the world for five and twenty years  and i ve kept my eyes open  and  when i was of an age to be silly  the man i was silly about had your  coloured eyes  he married an actress  poor fellow   or rather  she  married him  before he could say  knife   that s the sort of thing  that ll happen to you  unless you re uncommonly careful  so that s  settled  you give me your word not to try to see betty       i give you my word  you won t believe in my regret        i believe in that right enough  it must be simply sickening to have  the whole show given away like this  oh  i believe in your regret       my regret   said vernon steadily   for any pain i may have caused  your niece  do please see how grateful i am to you for having seen at  once that it was not her fault at all  but wholly mine       very nicely said  good boy   said betty s aunt   well  my excellent  brother in law is waiting outside in the fly  gnashing his respectable  teeth  no doubt  and inferring all sorts of complications from the  length of our interview  good bye  you re just the sort of young man i  like  and i m sorry we haven t met on a happier footing  i m sure we  should have got on together  don t you think so       i m sure we should   said he truly   mayn t i hope       she laughed outright      you have indeed the passion for acquaintance without introduction    she said   no  you may  not  call on me in town  besides  i m never  there  good bye  and take care of yourself  you re bound to be bitten  some day you know  and bitten badly       i wish i thought you forgave me       forgive you  of course i forgive you  you can no more help making  love  i suppose  no  don t interrupt  the thing s the same whatever  you call it  you can no more help making love than a cat can help  stealing cream  only one day the cat gets caught  and badly beaten   and one day you ll get caught  and the beating will be a bad one   unless i m a greater fool than i take myself for  and now i ll go and  unlock betty s prison and console her  don t worry about her  i ll see  that she s not put upon  good night  no  in the circumstances you d  better  not  see me to my carriage      she shook hands cordially  and left vernon to his thoughts     miss desmond had done what she came to do  and he knew it  it was  almost a relief to feel that now he could not try to see betty however  much he wished it   however much he might know her to wish it  he  shrugged his shoulders and lighted another cigarette                                                 betty  worn out with crying  had fallen asleep  the sound of wheels  roused her  it seemed to rain cabs at the rectory to day     there were voices in the hall  steps on the stairs  her door was  unlocked and there entered no tray of prisoner s fare  no reproachful  step father  no protestant sister  but a brisk and well loved aunt   who shut the door  and spoke      all in the dark   she said   where are you  child       here   said betty      let me strike a light  oh  yes  there you are       oh  aunt   has he sent for you   said betty fearfully   oh  don t  scold me  auntie  i am so tired  i don t think i can bear any more       i m not going to scold you  you silly little kitten   said the aunt  cheerfully   come  buck up  it s nothing so very awful  after all   you ll be laughing at it all before a fortnight s over       then he hasn t told you       oh  yes  he has  he s told me everything there was to tell  and a lot  more  too  don t worry  child  you just go straight to bed and i ll  tuck you up  and we ll talk it all over in the morning       aunty   said betty  obediently beginning to unfasten her dress   did  he say anything about  him        well  yes  a little       he hasn t  hasn t done anything to him  has he       what could he do  giving drawing lessons isn t a hanging matter   bet       i haven t heard anything from him all day   and i thought        you won t hear anything more of him  betty  my dear  i ve seen your  mr  vernon  and a very nice young man he is  too  he s frightfully cut  up about having got you into a row  and he sees that the only thing he  can do is to go quietly away  i needn t tell you  betty  though i  shall have to explain it very thoroughly to your father  that mr   vernon is no more in love with you than you are with him  in fact he s  engaged to another girl  he s just interested in you as a promising  pupil       yes   said betty   of course i know that            chapter vii       the escape      it s all turned out exactly like what i said it was going to  exactly  to a t   said mrs  symes  wrapping her wet arms in her apron and  leaning them on the fence   if it wasn t that it s tuesday and me  behindhand as it is  i d tell you all about it       do the things good to lay a bit in the rinse water   said mrs  james   also leaning on the fence   sorter whitens them s what i always say  i  don t mind if i lend you a hand with the wringing after  what s turned  out like you said it was going to       miss betty s decline   mrs  symes laughed low and huskily   what did  i tell you  mrs  james       i don t quite remember not just at the minute   said mrs  james   you  tells so many things       and well for some people i do  else they wouldn t never know nothing   i told you as it wasn t no decline miss betty was setting down under   i said it was only what s natural  her being the age she is  i said  what she wanted was a young man  and i said she d get one  and what do  you think       i don t know  i m sure       she did get one   said mrs  symes impressively   that same week  just  as if she d been a listening to my very words  it was as it might be  friday you and me had that little talk  well  as it might be the  saturday  she meets the young man  a painting pictures in the  warren  my ernest s youngest saw  em a talking  and told his mother  when he come home to his dinner       to think of that  and me never hearing a word   said mrs  james with  frank regret      i knew it ud be  whistle and i ll come to you  my lad    mrs  symes  went on with cumbrous enjoyment   and so it was  they used to keep  their rondyvoos in the wood  six o clock in the morning  mrs  wilson s  tom used to see  em reg lar every day as he went by to his work       lor   said mrs  james feebly      of course tom he never said nothing  except to a few friends of his  over a glass  they enjoyed the joke  i promise you  but old george  marbould  he ain t never been quite right in his head  i don t think   since his ruby went wrong  pity  i always think  a great clumsy  plain faced girl like her might a kept herself respectable  she hadn t  the temptation some of us might have had in our young days       no indeed   said mrs  james  smoothing her hair   and old  george  what silliness was he up to this time       why he sees the two of  em together one fine morning and  stead of  doing like he d be done by he ups to the vicarage and tells the old  man   you come alonger me  sir   says he   and have a look at your  daughter a kissin  and huggin  up in beale s shed  along of a perfect  stranger   so the old man he says   god bless you    george is proud  of him saying that  and off he goes  in a regular fanteague  beats the  young master to a jelly  for all he s an old man and feeble  and shuts  miss up in her room  now that wouldn t a been  my  way       no  indeed   said mrs  james      i should a asked him in   said mrs  symes   if it had been a gell of  mine  and give him a good meal with a glass of ale to it  and a tiddy  drop of something to top up with  and i d a let him light his nasty  pipe   and then when he was full and contented i d a up and said    now my man  you ve  ad time to think it over  and no one can t say as  i ve hurried you nor flurried you  but it s time as we began talking   so just you tell me what you re a goin to do about it  if you  ave the  feelings of a man   i d a said  you ll marry the girl        yes  indeed   said mrs  james with emotion      instead of which  bless your  art  he beats the young man off with a  stick  like as if he was a mad dog  and young miss is a goin  to be  sent to furrin parts to a strick boardin  school  to learn her not to  have any truck with young chaps        ard  i call it   said mrs  james      an  well you may  crooil  ard  how s he expect the girl to get a  husband if he drives the young fellers away with walking sticks  pore  gell  i shouldn t wonder but what she lives and dies a maid  after  this set out       we shall miss  er when she goes   said mrs  james      i don t say we shan t  but there ain t no one as you can t get on  without if you re put to it and whether or not  she s going to far  foreign parts where there ain t no young chaps       poor young thing   said mrs  james  very sympathetic   i think i ll  drop in as i m passing  and see how she takes it       if you do   said mrs  symes  unrolling her arms  white and wrinkled  with washing  to set them aggressively on her lips   it s the last  word as passes between us  mrs  james  so now you know       lord  maria  don t fly out at me that way   mrs  james shrank back    how was i to know you d take it like that       do you suppose   asked mrs  symes   as no one ain t got no legs  except you   i m  a going up  soon as i ve got the things on the line  and cleaned myself  i only heard it after i d got every blessed rag in  soak  or i d a gone up afore       mightn t i step up with you for company   mrs  james asked      no  you mightn t  but i don t mind dropping in as i come home  to  tell you about it  one of them catholic nunnery schools  i expect   which it s sudden death to a man but to set his foot into       poor young thing   said mrs  james again                                                 betty was going to paris     there had been  much talk about and about  the project  now it was to  be     there had been interviews     there was the first in which the elder miss desmond told her  brother in law in the plain speech she loved exactly what sort of a  fool he had made of himself in the matter of betty and the  fortune telling     when he was convinced of error  it was not easily done  he would have  liked to tell betty that he was sorry  but he belonged to a generation  that does not apologise to the next     the second interview was between the aunt and betty  that was the one  in which so much good advice was given      you know   the aunt wound up   all young women want to be in love   and all young men too  i don t mean that there was anything of that  sort between you and your artist friend  but there might have been   now look here   i m going to speak quite straight to you  don t you  ever let young men get monkeying about with your hands  whether they  call it fortune telling or whether they don t  their reason for doing  so is always the same  or likely to be  and you want to keep your  hand  as well as your lips  for the man you re going to marry  that s  all  but don t you forget it  now what s this i hear about your  wanting to go to paris       i did want to go   said betty   but i don t care about anything now   everything s hateful       it always is   said the aunt   but it won t always be       don t think i care a straw about not seeing mr  vernon again   said  betty hastily   it s not that       of course not   said the aunt sympathetically      no   but father was so hateful  you ve no idea  if i d  if i d run  away and got married secretly he couldn t have made more fuss       you re a little harsh  just a little  of course you and i know  exactly how it was  but remember how it looked to him  why  it  couldn t have looked worse if you really  had  been arranging an  elopement       he  hadn t  got his arm around me   insisted betty   it was somewhere  right away in the background  he was holding himself up with it       don t i tell you i understand all that perfectly  what i want to  understand is how you feel about paris  are you absolutely off the  idea       i couldn t go if i wasn t       i wonder what you think paris is like   mused the aunt   i suppose  you think it s all one wild razzle dazzle  one delirious round of  of  museums and picture galleries       no  i don t   said betty rather shortly      if you went you d have to work       there s no chance of my going       then we ll put the idea away and say no more about it  get me my  continental bradshaw out of my dressing bag  i m no use here  nobody  loves me  and i ll go to norway by the first omnibus to morrow  morning       don t   said betty   how can you say nobody loves you       your step father doesn t  anyway  that s why i can make him do what i  like when i take the trouble  when people love you they ll never do  anything for you   not even answer a plain question with a plain yes  or no  go and get the bradshaw  you ll be sorry when i m gone       aunt julia  you don t really mean it       of course not  i never mean anything except the things i don t say   the bradshaw      betty came and sat on the arm of her aunt s chair      it s not fair to tease me   she said   and tantalise me  you know how  mizzy i am       no  i don t know anything  you won t tell me anything  go and get        dear  darling  pretty  kind  clever aunt   cried betty   i d give my  ears to go       then borrow a large knife from cook  and sharpen it on the front  door step  no  i don t mean to use it on your step father  i ll have  your pretty ears mummified and wear them on my watch chain  no  mind  my spectacles  let me go  i daresay it won t come to anything       do you really mean you d take me       i d take you fast enough  but i wouldn t keep you  we must find a  dragon to guard the princess  oh  we ll get a nice tame kind puss cat  of a dragon   but that dragon will not be your aunt julia  let me go   i say  i thought you didn t care about anything any more       i didn t know there could be anything to care for   said betty  honestly   especially paris  well  i won t if you hate it so  but oh   aunt    she still sat on the floor by the chair her aunt had left  and  thought and thought  the aunt went straight down to the study      now  cecil   she said  coming briskly in and shutting the door    you ve made that poor child hate the thought of you and you ve only  yourself to thank       i know you think so   said he  closing the heavy book over which he  had been stooping      i don t mean   she added hastily  for she was not a cruel woman    that she really hates you  of course  but you ve frightened her  and  shaken her nerves  locking her up in her room like that  upon my word   you are old enough to know better       i was so alarmed  so shaken myself    he began  but she interrupted  him      i didn t come in and disturb your work just to say all that  of  course   she said   but really  cecil  i understand things better than  you think  i know how fond you really are of betty      the reverend cecil doubted this  but he said nothing      and you know that i m fond enough of the child myself  now  all this  has upset you both tremendously  what do you propose to do       i  i  nothing i thought  the less said about these deplorable affairs  the better  lizzie will soon recover her natural tone  and forget all  about the matter       then you mean to let everything go on in the old way       why  of course   said he uneasily      well  it s your own affair  naturally   she spoke with a studied air  of detachment which worried him exactly as it was meant to do      what do you mean   he asked anxiously  he had never been able wholly  to approve miss julia desmond  she smoked cigarettes  and he could not  think that this would have been respectable in any other woman  of  course  she was different from any other woman  but still    then the  reverend cecil could not deem it womanly to explore  unchaperoned  the  less well known quarters of four continents  to penetrate even to  regions where skirts were considered improper and side saddles were  unknown  even the nearness of miss desmond s fiftieth birthday hardly  lessened at all the poignancy of his disapproval  besides  she had not  always been fifty  and she had always  in his recollection of her   smoked cigarettes  and travelled alone  yet he had a certain  well founded respect for her judgment  and for that fine luminous  common sense of hers which had more than once shewn him his own  mistakes  on the rare occasions when he and she had differed he had  always realized  later  that she had been in the right  and she was   gentlemanly  enough never once to have said   i told you so       what do you mean   he asked again  for she was silent  her hands in  the pockets of her long coat  her sensible brown shoes sticking  straight out in front of her chair      if you really want to know  i ll tell you   she said   but i hate to  interfere in other people s business  you see  i know how deeply she  has felt this  and of course i know you have too  so i wondered  whether you hadn t thought of some little plan for  for altering the  circumstances a little  so that everything will blow over and settle  down  so that when you and she come together again you ll be better  friends than ever       come together again   he repeated  and the paper knife was still  restless   do you want me to let her go away  to london      visions of lizzie  in unseemly low necked dresses surrounded by crowds  of young men  all possible vernons  lent a sudden firmness to his  voice  a sudden alertness to his manner      no  certainly not   she answered the voice and the manner as much as  the words   i shouldn t dream of such a thing  then it hadn t occurred  to you       it certainly had not       you see   she said earnestly   it s like this  at least this is how i  see it  she s all shaken and upset  and so are you  and when i ve  gone  and i must go in a very little time  you ll both of you simply  settle down to thinking over it all  and you ll grow farther and  farther apart       i don t think so   said he   things like this always right themselves  if one leaves them alone  lizzie and i have always got on very well  together  in a quiet way  we are neither of us demonstrative       now heaven help the man   was the woman s thought  she remembered  betty s clinging arms  her heartfelt kisses  the fervency of the voice  that said   dear darling  pretty  kind  clever aunt  i d give my ears  to go   betty not demonstrative  heaven help the man      no   she said   i know  but when people are young these thinks  rankle       they won t with her   he said   she has a singularly noble nature   under that quiet exterior      miss desmond drew a long breath and began afresh      then there s another thing  she s fretting over this  thinks now that  it was something to be ashamed of  she didn t think so at the time  of  course       you mean that it was i who       this was thin ice again  miss desmond skated quickly away from it  with   well  you see  i ve been talking to her  she really  is   fretting  why she s got ever so much thinner in the last week       i could get a locum   he said slowly   and take her to a hydropathic  establishment for a fortnight       oh dear  oh dear   said miss desmond to herself  aloud she said    that  would  be delightful  later  but just now  well  of course it s  for you to decide   but it seems to me that it would be better for you  two to be apart for a while  if you re here alone together  well  the  very sight of you will remind each other  that s not grammar  as you  say  but       he had not said anything  he was thinking  fingering the brass bosses  on the corners of the divine augustine  and tracing the pattern on the  stamped pigskin      of course if you care to risk it   she went on still with that fine  air of detachment    but i have seen breaches that nothing could heal  arise in just that way      two people sitting down together and thinking over everything they had  against each other      but i ve nothing against lizzie       i daresay not   miss desmond lost patience at last   but she has  against you  or will have if you let her stay here brooding over it   however if you like to risk it  i m sorry i spoke   she got up and  moved to the door      no  no   he said hastily   do not be sorry you spoke  you have given  me food for reflection  i will think it all over quietly and  and     he did not like to talk about prayers to miss desmond somehow    and  calmly and if i see that you are right  i am sure you mean most  kindly by me       indeed i do   she said heartily  and gave him her hand in the manly  way he hated  he took it  held it limply an instant  and repeated      most kindly      he thought it over for so long that the aunt almost lost hope      i have to hold my tongue with both hands to keep it quiet  and if i  say another word i shall spoil the song   she told betty   i ve done  my absolute best  if that doesn t fetch him  nothing will      it had  fetched him   at the end of two interminable days he sent to  ask miss desmond to speak to him in the study  she went      i have been thinking carefully   he said   most carefully  and i feel  that you are right  perhaps i owe her some amends  do you know of any  quiet country place      miss desmond thought betty had perhaps for the moment had almost  enough of quiet country places      she is very anxious to learn drawing   he said   and perhaps if i  permitted her to do so she might understand it as a sign that i  cherish no resentment on account of what has passed  but        i know the very thing   said the aunt  and went on to tell of madame  gautier  of her cloistral home in paris where she received a few  favoured young girls  of the vigilant maid who conducted them to and  from their studies  of the quiet villa on the marne where in the  summer an able master  at least    or    years of age  conducted  sketching parties  to which the students were accompanied either by  madame herself  or by the dragon maid      i ll stand the child six months with her   she said   or a year even   so it won t cost you anything  and madame gautier is in london now   you could run up and talk to her yourself       does she speak english   he asked  anxiously  and being reassured  questioned further      and you   he asked  and when he heard that norway for a month and  then america en route for japan formed miss desmond s programme for  the next year he was only just able to mask  with a cough  his deep  sigh of relief  for  however much he might respect her judgment  he  was always easier when lizzie and her aunt julia were not together     he went up to town  and found madame gautier  the widow of a french  pastor  established in a bloomsbury boarding house  she was a woman  after his own heart  severe  simple  earnest  if he had to part with  his lizzie  he told himself in the returning train  it could be to no  better keeper than this     he himself announced his decision to betty      i have decided   he said  and he spoke very coldly because it was so  very difficult to speak at all   to grant you the wish you expressed  some time ago  you shall go to paris and learn drawing       do you really mean it   said betty  as coldly as he      i am not in the habit of saying things which i do not mean       thank you very much   said betty   i will work hard  and try that the  money shan t be wasted       your aunt has kindly offered to pay your expenses       when do i go   asked betty      as soon as your garments can be prepared  i trust that i shall not  have cause to regret the confidence i have decided to place in you      his phrasing was seldom well inspired  had he said   i trust you  my  child  and i know i shan t regret it   which was what he meant  she  would have come to meet him more than half way  as it was she said    thank you   again  and left him without more words  he sighed      i don t believe she is pleased after all  but she sees i am doing it  for her good  now it comes to the point her heart sinks at the idea of  leaving home  but she will understand my motives      the one thought betty gave him was      he can t bear the sight of me at all now  he s longing to be rid of  me  well  thank heaven i m going to paris  i will have a grass lawn  dress over green  with three rows of narrow lace insertion  and a hat  with yellow roses and  oh  it can t be true  it s too good to be true   well  it s a good thing to be hated sometimes  by some people  if they  only hate you enough                                                    so you re going to foreign parts  miss   says i      mrs  symes had flung back her bonnet strings and was holding a  saucerful of boiling tea skilfully poised on the fingers of one hand     yes  mrs  symes   says she   don t you wish you was going too   she  says  and she laughed  but i m not easy blinded  and well i see as she  only laughed to  ide a bleedin   art   not me  miss   says i   nice  figure i should look a goin  to a furrin  boardin  school at my time  of life        it ain t boardin  school   says she   i m a going to learn to paint  pictures  i ll paint your portrait when i come home   says she  and  laughs again  i could see she done it to keep the tears back       i m sorry for you  miss  i m sure   i says  not to lose the chance  of a word in season   but i hope it ll prove a blessing to you  i do  that         oh  it ll be a blessing right enough   says she  and keeps on  laughing a bit wild like  when the art s full you can t always stop  yourself  she d a done better to  ave a good cry and tell me  er  troubles  i could a cheered her up a bit p raps  you know whether i m  considered a comfort at funerals and christenings  mrs  james       i do   said mrs  james sadly   none don t know it better       you d a thought she d a bin glad of a friend in need  but no  she  just goes on a laughing fit to bring tears to your eyes to hear her   and says she   i hope you ll all get on all right without me        i hope you said as how we should miss her something dreadful   said  mrs  james anxiously   have another cup       thank you  my dear  do you take me for a born loony  course i did   said the parish wouldn t be the same without her  and about her pretty  reading and all  see here what she give me      mrs  james unrolled a violet petticoat      good as new  almost   she said  looking critically at the hem    specially her being taller n me  so what s not can be cut away  and  no loss  she kep  on a laughing an  a smiling till the old man he come  in and he says in his mimicking way   lizzie   says  e   they re  a waitin  to fit on your new walkin  costoom   he says  so i come  away  she a smiling to the last something awful to see       dear  dear   said mrs  james      but you mark my words  she don t deceive  me   if ever i see a  bruised reed and a broken  art on a young gell s face i see it on  hers this day  she may laugh herself black in the face  but she won t  laugh me into thinking what i knows to be far otherwise       ah   said mrs  james resignedly   we all  as it to bear one time or  another  young gells is very deceitful though  in their ways  ain t  they              book     the man          chapter viii       the one and the other      some idiot   remarked eustace vernon  sipping vermouth at a little  table   insists that  if you sit long enough outside the cafe de la  paix  you will see everyone you have ever known or ever wanted to know  pass by  i have sat here for half an hour  and   voila        you met me  half an hour ago   said the other man      oh   you    said vernon affectionately      and your hat has gone off every half minute ever since   said the  other man      ah  that s to the people i ve known  it s the people i ve wanted to  know that are the rarity       do you mean people you have wanted to know and not known       there aren t many of those   said vernon   no it s  jove  that s a  sweet woman       i hate the type   said the other man briefly   all clothes  no real  human being      the woman was beautifully dressed  in the key whose harmonies are only  mastered by frenchwomen and americans  she turned her head as her  carriage passed  and vernon s hat went off once more      i d forgotten her profile   said vernon   and she s learned how to  dress since i saw her last  she s quite human  really  and as charming  as anyone ought to be       so i should think   said the other man   i m sorry i said that  but i  didn t know you knew her  how s trade       oh  i did a picture  well  but a picture  i did it in england in the  spring  best thing i ve done yet  come and see it       i should like to look you up  where do you hang out       eighty six bis rue notre dame des champs   said vernon   everyone in  fiction lives there  it s the only street on the other side that  authors seem ever to have dreamed of  still  it s convenient  so i  herd there with all sorts of blackguards  heroes and villains and what  not  eighty six bis       i ll come   said the other man  slowly   do you know  vernon  i d  like awfully to get at your point of view  your philosophy of life       haven t you got one  my dear chap    sufficient unto  is my motto       you paint pictures    the other went on   so very much too good for  the sort of life you lead      vernon laughed      my dear temple   he said   i live  mostly  the life of a vestal  virgin       you know well enough i m not quarrelling with the way you spend your  evenings   said his dear temple   it s your whole outlook that doesn t  match your work  yet there must be some relation between the two   that s what i d like to get at      there is a bond stronger than friendship  stronger than love  a bond  that cannot be forged in any other shop than the one  the bond between  old schoolfellows  vernon had sometimes wondered why he  stood so  much  from temple  it is a wonder that old schoolfellows often feel   mutually      the subject you ve started   said he   is of course  to me  the most  interesting  please develop your thesis       well then  your pictures are good  strong  thorough stuff  with  sentiment  yes  just enough sentiment to keep them from the brutality  of degas or the sensualism of latouche  whereas you  yourself  seem to  have no sentiment       i  no sentiment  oh  bobby  this is too much  why  i m a mass of it   ask        yes  ask any woman of your acquaintance  that s just it  or just part  of it  you fool them into thinking  oh  i don t know what  but you  don t fool me       i haven t tried       then you re not brutal  except half a dozen times in the year when  you  and i ve noticed that when your temper goes smash your morals go  at the same time  is that cause or effect  what s the real you like   and where do you keep it       the real me   said vernon   is seen in my pictures  and  and  appreciated by my friends  you for instance  are  i believe  genuinely  attached to me       oh  rot   said bobby      i don t see   said vernon  moving his iron chair to make room for two  people at the next table   why you should expect my pictures to rhyme  with my life  a man s art doesn t rhyme with his personality  most  often it contradicts flatly  look at musicians  what a divine art  and  what pigs of high priests  and look at actors  but no  one can t  the  spectacle is too sickening       i sometimes think   said temple  emptying his glass   that the real  you isn t made yet  it s waiting for        for the refining touch of a woman s hand  eh  you think the real me  is  oh  temple  temple  i ve no heart for these childish imaginings   the real me is the man that paints pictures  damn good pictures  too   though i say it       and is that what all the women think      ask them  my dear chap  ask them  they won t tell you the truth       they re not the only ones who won t  i should like to know what you  really think of women  vernon       i don t think about them at all   lied vernon equably   they aren t  subjects for thought but for emotion  and even of that as little as  may be  it s impossible seriously to regard a woman as a human being   she s merely a dear  delightful  dainty        plaything       well  yes  or rather a very delicately tuned musical instrument  if  you know the scales and the common chords  you can improvise nice  little airs and charming variations  she s a sort of  well  a penny  whistle  and the music you get depends not on her at all  but on your  own technique       i ve never been in love   said temple   not seriously  i mean   he  hastened to add  for vernon was smiling   not a life or death matter   don t you know  but i do hate the way you talk  and one of these days  you ll hate it too      miss desmond s warning floated up through the dim waters of half a  year      so a lady told me  only last spring   he said   well  i ll take my  chance  going  well  i m glad we ran across each other  don t forget  to look me up      temple moved off  and vernon was left alone  he sat idly smoking  cigarette after cigarette  and watched the shifting crowd  it was a  bright october day  and the crowd was a gay one     suddenly his fingers tightened on his cigarette   but he kept the  hand that held it before his face  and he bent his head forward     two ladies were passing  on foot  one was the elder miss desmond  she  who had warned him that one of these days he would be caught  and the  other  hanging lovingly on her aunt s arm  was  of course  betty  but  a smart  changed  awakened betty  she was dressed almost as  beautifully as the lady whose profile he had failed to recognise  but  much more simply  her eyes were alight  and she was babbling away to  her aunt  she was even gesticulating a little  for all the world like  a french girl  he noted the well gloved hand with which she emphasized  some point in her talk      that s the hand   he said   that i held when we sat on the plough in  the shed and i told her fortune      he had risen  and his feet led him along the road they had taken  ten  yards ahead of him he saw the swing of the aunt s serviceable brown  skirt and beside it betty s green and gray      i am not breaking my word   he replied to the inward monitor   who s  going out of his way to speak to the girl      he watched the brown gown and the green all the way down the boulevard  des capucines  saw them cross the road and go up the steps of the  madeleine  he paused at the corner  it was hard  certainly  to keep  his promise  yet so far it was easy  because he could not well recall  himself to the misses desmond on the ground of his having six months  ago involved the one in a row with her relations  and discussed the  situation afterwards with the other      i do wonder where they re staying  though   he told himself   if one  were properly introduced     but he knew that the aunt would consider  no introduction a proper one that should renew his acquaintance with  betty      wolf  wolf   he said   let the fold alone  there s no door for you   and you ve pledged your sacred word as an honourable wolf not to jump  any more hurdles      and as he stood musing  the elder miss desmond came down the church  steps and walked briskly away     some men would  doubtless  have followed her example  if not her  direction  vernon was not one of these  he found himself going up the  steps of the great church  he had as good a right to go into the  madeleine as the next man  he would probably not see the girl  if he  did he would not speak  almost certainly he would not even see her     but destiny had remembered mr  vernon once more  betty was standing  just inside the door  her face upturned  and all her soul in her eyes   the mutterings of the organ and the voices of boys filled the great  dark building     he went and stood close by her  he would not speak  he would keep his  word  but she should have a chance of speaking  his eyes were on her  face  the hymn ended  she exhaled a held breath  started and spoke      you   she said    you    the two words are spelled alike  spoken   they are capable of infinite variations  the first  you  sent vernon s  blood leaping  the second froze it to what it had been before he met  her  for indeed that little unfinished idyll had been almost forgotten  by the man who sat drinking vermouth outside the cafe de la paix      how are you   he whispered   won t you shake hands      she gave him a limp and unresponsive glove      i had almost forgotten you   she said   but i am glad to see  you  because  come to the door  i don t like talking in churches      they stood on the steps behind one of the great pillars      do you think it is wise to stand here   he said   your aunt might see  us       so you followed us in   said betty with perfect self possession    that was very kind  i have often wished to see you  to tell you how  much obliged i am for all your kindness in the spring  i was only a  child then  and i didn t understand  but now i quite see how good it  was of you       why do you talk like that   he said   you don t think  you can t  think it was my fault       your fault  what       why  your father finding us and        oh   that    she said lightly   oh  i had forgotten that  ridiculous   wasn t it  no  i mean your kindness in giving so many hours to  teaching a perfect duffer  well  now i ve seen you and said what i had  to say  i think i ll go back       no  don t go   he said   i want to know  oh  all sorts of things  i  can see your aunt from afar  and fly if she approaches       you don t suppose   said betty  opening her eyes at him   that i  shan t tell her i ve seen you      he had supposed it  and cursed his clumsiness      ah  i see   she went on   you think i should deceive my aunt now  because i deceived my step father in the spring  but i was a child  then   and besides  i m fond of my aunt       did you know that she came to see me       of course  you seem to think we live in an atmosphere of deceit  mr   vernon       what s the matter with you   he said bluntly  for finer weapons  seemed useless   what have i done to make you hate me       i hate you  oh  no  not in the least   said betty spitefully   i am  very grateful to you for all your kindness       where are you staying   he asked      hotel bete   said betty  off her guard   but       the  but  marked his first score      i wish i could have called to see your aunt   he said carelessly    but i am off to vienna to morrow      betty believed that she did not change countenance by a hair s  breadth      i hope you ll have a delightful time   she said politely      thanks  i am sure i shall  the only consolation for leaving paris is  that one is going to vienna  are you here for long       i don t know   betty was on her guard again      paris is a delightful city  isn t it       most charming       have you been here long       no  not very long       are you still working at your painting  it would be a pity to give  that up       i am not working just now       i see your aunt   he said hurriedly   are you going to send me away  like this  don t be so unjust  so ungenerous  it s not like you  my  pupil of last spring was not unjust       your pupil of last spring was a child and a duffer  mr  vernon  as i  said before  but she is grateful to you for one thing  no  two       what s the other   he asked swiftly      your drawing lessons   she demurely answered      then what s the one       good bye   she said  and went down the steps to meet her aunt  he  effaced himself behind a pillar  in spite of her new coldness  he  could not believe that she would tell her aunt of the meeting  and he  was right  though betty s reasons were not his reasons      what s the good   she asked herself as she and her aunt walked across  to their hotel   he s going away to morrow  and i shall never see him  again  well  i behaved beautifully  that s one thing  he must simply  loathe me  so that s all right  if he were staying on in paris  of  course i would tell her      she believed this fully     he waited five minutes behind that pillar  and then had himself driven  to the rue notre dame des champs  choosing as driver a man with a  white hat  in strict accordance with the advice in baedeker  though he  had never read any of the works of that author     this new betty  with the smart gown and the distant manner  awoke at  the same time that she contradicted his memories of the betty of long  barton  and he should not see her again  of course he was not going to  vienna  but neither was he going to hang round the hotel bete  or to  bribe franz or elise to smuggle notes to miss betty      it s never any use trying to join things on again   he told himself    as well try to mend a spider s web when you have put your boot  through it         no diver brings up love again     dropped once          in such cold seas       but what has happened  why does she hate me so  you acted very  nicely  dear  but that wasn t indifference  it was hatred  if ever  i ve seen it  i wonder what it means  another lover  no  then she d be  sorry for me  it s something that belongs to me  not another man s  shadow  but what i shall never know  and she s prettier than ever   too  oh  hang it      his key turned in the lock  and on the door mat shewed the white  square of an envelope  a note from the other woman  the one whose  profile he had not remembered  she was in paris for a time  she had  seen him at the paix  had wondered whether he had his old rooms  had  driven straight up on the chance of being able to leave this  wasn t  that devotion   and would he care to call for her at eight and they  could dine somewhere and talk over old times  one familiar initial   that of her first name  curled in the corner and the card smelt of  jasmine  not of jasmine scent in bottles  but of the real flower  he  had never known how she managed it     vernon was not fond of talking over old times  but betty would be  dining at the hotel bete  some dull hole  no doubt  he had never heard  of it  well  he could not dine at the bete  and after all one must  dine somewhere  and the other woman had never bored him  that is a  terrible weapon in the hands of a rival  and betty had been most  unjust  and what was betty to him  anyway  his thoughts turned to the  american girl who had sketched with him in brittany that summer  ah   if she had not been whisked back to new york by her people  it would  not now be a question of betty or of the jasmine lady  he took out  miss van tromp s portrait and sat looking at it  it was admirable  the  fearless poise of the head  the laughing eyes  the full pouting lips   then betty s face and the face of the jasmine lady came between him  and miss van tromp      bah   he said   smell  kiss  wear  at last throw away  never keep a  rose till it s faded   a little tide of breton memories swept through  him      bah   he said again   she was perfectly charming  but what is the use  of charm  half the world away      he pulled his trunk from the front of the fire place  pushed up the  iron damper  and made a little fire  he burned all miss van tromp s  letters  and her photograph  but  from habit  or from gratitude  he  kissed it before he burned it      now   said he as the last sparks died redly on the black embers   the  decks are cleared for action  shall i sentimentalise about  betty  cold  cruel  changed betty  or shall i call for the jasmine  lady      he did both  and the jasmine lady might have found him dull  as it  happened  she only found him  distrait   and that interested her      when we parted   she said   it was i who was in tears  now it s you   what is it       if i am in tears   he roused himself to say   it is only because  everything passes   tout lasse  tout passe  tout casse        what s broken now   she asked   another heart  oh  yes  you broke  mine all to little  little bits  but i ve mended it  i wanted  frightfully to see you to thank you      this is a grateful day for women   thought vernon  looking the  interrogatory      why  for showing me how hearts are broken   she explained   it s  quite easy when you know how  and it s a perfectly delightful game  i  play it myself now  and i can t imagine how i ever got on before i  learned the rules       you forget   he said  smiling   it was you who broke my heart  and  it s not mended yet       that s very sweet of you  but really  you know  i m very glad it was  you who broke my heart  and not anyone else  because  now it s mended   that gives us something to talk about  we have a past  that s really  what i wanted to tell you  and that s such a bond  isn t it  when it  really  is  past  dead  you know  no nonsense about cataleptic  trances  but stone dead       yes   he said   it is a link  but it isn t the past for me  you know   it can never       she held up a pretty jewelled hand      now  don t   she said   that s just what you don t understand  all  that s out of the picture  i know you too well  just realize that i m  the only nice woman you know who doesn t either expect you to make  love to her in the future or hate you for having done it in the past   and you ll want to see me every day  think of the novelty of it       i do and i do   said he   and i won t protest any more while you re  in this mood  bear with me if i seem idiotic to night  i ve been  burning old letters  and that always makes me like a funeral       old letters  mine       i burned yours long ago       and it isn t two years since we parted  how many have there been  since       is this the inquisition or is it durand s       it s somewhere where we both are   she said  without a trace of  sentiment   that s good enough for me  do you know i ve been married  since i saw you last   and  left a widow  in a short three months it  all happened  and  well i m not very clever  as you know  but  can you  imagine what it is like to be married to a man who doesn t understand  a single word you say  unless it s about the weather or things to eat   no  don t look shocked  he was a good fellow  and very happy till the  motor accident took him and left me this      she shewed a scar on her smooth arm      what a woman it is for surprises  so he was very happy  but of course  he was       yes  of course  as you say  i was a model wife  i wore black for a  whole year too       why did you marry him       well  at the time i thought you might hear of it and be disappointed   or hurt  or something       so i am   said vernon with truth      you needn t be   said she   you ll find me much nicer now i don t  want to disappoint you or hurt you  but only to have a good time  and  there s no nonsense about love to get in the way  and spoil  everything       so you re  but this isn t proper  here am i dining with a lady and i  don t even know her name       i know  i wouldn t put it to the note  didn t that single initial  arouse your suspicions  her name  her title if you please  i married  harry st  craye  you remember how we used to laugh at him together       that little  i beg your pardon  lady st  craye       yes   she said   de mortuis nil nisi bonum  of the dead nothing but  the bones  if he had lived he would certainly have beaten me  here s  to our new friendship       our new friendship   he repeated  raising his glass and looking in  her eyes  lady st  craye looked very beautiful  and betty was not  there  in fact  just now there was no betty     he went back to his room humming a song of yvette guilbert s  there  might have been no flowering may  no buttercup meadows in all the  world  for any thought of memory that he had of them  and betty was a  thousand miles away     that was at night  in the morning betty was at the hotel bete  and the  hotel bete was no longer a petty little hotel which he did not know  and never should know  for the early post brought him a letter which  said      i am in paris for a few days and should like to see you if you can  make it convenient to call at my hotel on thursday      this was tuesday     the letter was signed with the name of the uncle from whom vernon had  expectations  and at the head of the letter was the address        hotel bete     cite de retraite     rue boissy d anglais       now bear witness   cried vernon  appealing to the universe   bear  witness that this is  not  my fault            chapter ix       the opportunity     vernon in those two days decided that he did not wish to see betty  again  she was angry with him  and  though he never for an instant  distrusted his power to dissipate the cloud  he felt that the lifting  of it would leave him and her in that strong light wherein the frail  flower of sentiment must wither and perish  explications were fatal to  the delicate mystery  the ethereal half lights  that vernon loved   above all things he detested the  trop dit      already a mood of much daylight was making him blink and shrink  he  saw himself as he was  or nearly  and the spectacle did not please  him  the thought of lady st  craye was the only one that seemed to  make for any sort of complacency  the thought of temple rankled oddly      he likes me  and he dislikes himself for liking me  why does he like  me  why does anyone like me  i m hanged if i know      this was the other side of his mood of most days  when the wonder  seemed that everyone should not like him  why shouldn t they   ordinarily he was hanged if he knew that     he had expected a note from lady st  craye to follow up his dinner  with her  he knew how a woman rarely resists the temptation to write  to the man in whom she is interested  even while his last words are  still ringing in her ears  but no note came  and he concluded that  lady st  craye was not interested  this reassured while it piqued     the hotel bete is very near the madeleine  and very near the heart of  paris  of gay paris  that is   yet it might have been a hundred miles  from anywhere  you go along the rue boissy  and stopping at a gateway  you turn into a dreary paved court  which is the cite de la retraite   here the doors of the hotel bete open before you like the portals of a  mausoleum  there is no greeting from the patronne  your arrival gives  rise to no pleasant welcoming bustle  the concierge receives you  and  you see at once that her cheerful smile is assumed  no one could  really be cheerful at the hotel bete     vernon felt as though he was entering a family vault of the highest  respectability when he passed through its silent hall and enquired for  mr  james vernon     monsieur vernon was out  no  he had charged no one with a billet for  monsieur  monsieur vernon would doubtless return for the dejeuner  it  was certain that he would return for the diner  would monsieur wait     monsieur waited  in a little stiff salon with glass doors  prim  furniture  and an elaborately ornamental french clock  it was silent   of course  one wonders sometimes whether ornamental french ormolu  clocks have any works  or are solid throughout  for no one has ever  seen one of them going     there were day old english papers on the table  and the new york  herald  through the glass doors he could see everyone who came in or  went out  and he saw no one  there was a stillness as of the tomb     even the waiter  now laying covers for the dejeuner  wore list  slippers and his movements were silent as a heron s ghost gray flight     he came to the glass door presently      did monsieur breakfast      vernon was not minded to waste two days in the pursuit of uncles  here  he was  and here he stayed  till uncle james should appear     yes  decidedly  monsieur breakfasted     he wondered where the clients of the hotel had hidden themselves  were  they all dead  or merely sight seeing  as his watch shewed him the  approach of half past twelve he found himself listening for the tramp  of approaching feet  the rustle of returning skirts  and still all was  silent as the grave     the sudden summoning sound of a bell roused him from a dreamy wonder  as to whether betty and her aunt had already left  if not  should he  meet them at dejeuner  the idea of the possible meeting amused more  than it interested him  he crossed the hall and entered the long bare  salle a manger     by heaven  he was the only guest  a cover was laid for him only  no   at a distance of half the table for another  then betty and her aunt  had gone  well  so much the better     he unfolded his table napkin  in another moment  doubtless  uncle  james would appear to fill the vacant place     but in another moment the vacant place was filled  and by betty  betty  alone  unchaperoned  and bristling with hostility  she bowed very  coldly  but she was crimson to the ears  he rose and came to her  holding out his hand     with the waiter looking on  betty had to give hers  but she gave it in  a way that said very plainly      i am very surprised and not at all pleased to see you here       this is a most unexpected pleasure   he said very distinctly  and  added the truth about his uncle      has monsieur vernon yet returned   he asked the waiter who hovered  anxiously near      no  monsieur was not yet of return       so you see   his look answered the speech of her hand   it is not my  doing in the least       i hope your aunt is well   he went on  the waiter handing baked eggs  the while      quite well  thank you   said betty   and how is your wife  i ought to  have asked yesterday  but i forgot       my wife       oh  perhaps you aren t married yet  of course my father told me of  your engagement      she crumbled bread and smiled pleasantly      so  that s  it   thought vernon   fool that i was to forget it       i am not married   he said coldly   nor have i ever been engaged to  be married      and he ate eggs stolidly wondering what her next move would be  it was  one that surprised him  for she leaned towards him and said in a  perfectly new voice      couldn t you get franz to move you a little more this way  one can t  shout across these acres of tablecloth  and i ve heaps of things to  tell you      he moved nearer  and once again he wronged betty by a mental  shrinking  was she really going to own that she had resented the news  of his engagement  she was really hopeless  he began to bristle  defensively      illustration    ah  don t be cross   she said       anything you care to tell me will of course be of the greatest  possible interest   he was beginning  but betty interrupted him       ah  don t be cross    she said   i know i was perfectly horrid  yesterday  but i own i was rather hurt       hold back   he adjured her  inwardly   for heaven s sake  hold back       you see   she went on   you and i were such good friends  you d been  so kind  and you told me  you talked to me about things you didn t  talk of to other people   and when i thought you d told my step father  a secret of yours that you d never told me  of course i felt  hurt  anyone would have       i see   said he  beginning to      of course i never dreamed that he d lied  and even now i don t see     then suddenly she did see and crimsoned again      he didn t lie   said vernon carefully   it was i  but i would never  have told him anything that i wouldn t have told you  nor half that i  did tell you      the waiter handed pale meat      yes  the scenery in brittany is most charming  i did some good work  there  the people are so primitive and delightful too      the waiter withdrew  and betty said      how do you mean  he didn t lie       the fact is   said vernon   he  he did not understand our friendship  in the least  i imagine friendship was not invented when he was young   it s a tiresome subject  miss desmond  let s drop it  shall we       if you like   said she  chilly as december      oh  well then  just let me say it was done for your sake  miss  desmond  he had no idea that two people should have any interests in  common except  except matters of the heart  and the shortest way to  convince him was to tell him that my heart was elsewhere  i don t like  lies  but there are some people who insist on lies  nothing else will  convince them of the truth  here comes some abhorrent preparation of  rice  how goes it with art       i have been working very hard   she said   but every day i seem to  know less and less       oh  that s all right  it s only that every day one knows more and  more  of how little one does know  you ll have to pass many milestones  before you pass out of that state  do they always feed you like this  here       some days it s custard   said betty   but we ve only been here a  week       we re friends again now  aren t we   he questioned suddenly      yes  oh  yes       then i may ask questions  i want to hear what you ve been doing since  we parted  and where you ve been  and how you come to paris  and where  your aunt is  and what she ll say to me when she comes in       she likes you   said betty   and she won t come in  but madame  gautier will  aunt julia went off this morning  she couldn t delay any  longer because of catching the p    o  at brindisi  and i m to wait  here till madame gautier comes at three  auntie came all the way back  from america to see whether i was happy here  she  is  a dear       and who is madame gautier  is she also a dear  but let s have our  coffee in the salon  and tell me everything from the beginning       yes   said betty   oh  yes      but the salon window was darkened by a passing shape      my uncle  bless him   said vernon   i must go  see  here s my card   won t you write and tell me all about everything  you will  won t  you       yes  but you musn t write to me  madame gautier opens all our  letters  and friendships weren t invented when she was young either   good bye      vernon had to go towards the strong english voice that was filling the  hall with its inquiries for  ung mossoo  ung mossoo anglay qui avoir  certainmong etty icy ce mattan      five minutes later betty saw two figures go along the pavement on the  other side of the decorous embroidered muslin blinds which  in the  unlikely event of any happening in the cite de la retraite  ensure its  not being distinctly seen by those who sojourn at the hotel bete     betty instantly experienced that feminine longing which makes women  write to lovers or friends from whom they have but now parted  and she  was weaker than lady st  craye  there was nothing to do  her trunks  were packed  she had before her two hours  or nearly  of waiting for  madame gautier  so she wrote  and this is the letter  erasures and  all  vernon  when he got it  was most interested in the erasures here  given in italics       dear mr  vernon       i am very glad we are good friends again  and i should like to tell    you everything that has happened    after you  after he  when my    step father    after the last time i saw you   i was very unhappy    because i wanted to go to paris   i was very anxious to go to paris    because of what you had said  my aunt came down and was very kind       she told me   she persuaded my step father to let me go  i think      we   he was glad to get rid of me  for   somehow   he never did    care about me  any more than i did about him  there are a great many      other   things that he does not understand  of course i was wild    with joy and thought of nothing but   what you   work  and my aunt    brought me over  but i did not see anything of paris then  we went    straight on to joinville where madame gautier has a villa  and      we   my aunt left me there  and went to norway  it was all very    strange at first  but i liked it  madame gautier is very strict  it    was like being at school  sometimes i almost   forgot   fancied that    i was at school again  there were three other girls besides me  and    we had great fun  the professor was very nice and encouraging  he is    very old  so is everybody who comes to the house    but   it      was   is jolly  because when there are four of you everything is    so interesting  we used to have picnics in the woods  and take it in    turn to ride in the donkey cart  and there were musical evenings    with the pastor and the avocat and their wives  it was very amusing    sometimes  madame gautier had let her paris flat  so we stayed at    joinville till a week ago  and then my aunt walked in one day and    took me to paris for a week  i did enjoy that  and now aunt has    gone  and madame gautier is taking the inventory and getting the    keys  and presently she will come for me  i shall go with her to the    rue vaugirard  number     it will be very nice seeing the other    girls again and telling them all about   everything   my week in    paris  i am so sorry that i shall not have the pleasure of seeing    you again  but i am glad we met  because i do not like to think my    friends do not trust me       yours sincerely       betty desmond     that was the letter which betty posted  but the first letter she wrote  was quite different  it began        you don t know  you never will know what it is to me to know that    you did not deceive me  my dear friend  my only friend  and how i    treated you yesterday  and how nobly you forgave me  i shall see you    again  i must see you again  no one else has ever understood me      and so on to the  true and constant friend betty      she burned this letter      the other must go   she said   that s the worst of life  if i sent  the one that s really written as i feel he d think i was in love with  him or some nonsense  but a child who was just in two syllables might  have written the other  so  that s  all right      she looked at her watch  the same silver watch with which she had once  crossed the hand of one who told her fortune      how silly all that was   she said   i have learned wisdom now  nearly  half past three  i never knew madame late before      and now betty began to watch the windows for the arrival of her  chaperone  and four o clock came  and five  but no madame gautier     she went out at last and asked to see the patronne  and to her she  explained in a french whose fluency out ran its correctness  that a  lady was to have called for her at three  it was now a quarter past  five  what did madame think she should do     madame was lethargic and uninterested  she had no idea  she could not  advise  probably mademoiselle would do well to wait always     the concierge was less aloof     but without doubt madame  mademoiselle s friend had forgotten the  hour  she would arrive later  certainly  if not  mademoiselle could  stay the night at the hotel  where a young lady would be perfectly  well  and go to madame her friend in the morning     but betty was not minded to stay the night alone at the hotel bete   for one thing she had very little money   save that in the fat  envelope addressed to madame gautier which her aunt had given her  it  contained  she knew  the money to pay for her board and lessons during  the next six months   for the elder miss desmond was off to india   japan and thibet  and her horror of banks and cheques made her very  downright in the matter of money  that in the envelope was all betty  had  and that was madame gautier s  but the other part of the  advice  to go to madame gautier s in the morning  if in the morning   why not now     she decided to go now  no one opposed the idea much  only franz seemed  a little disturbed and the concierge tepidly urged patience     but betty was fretted by waiting  also she knew that vernon and his  uncle might return at any moment  and it would perhaps be awkward for  him to find her there  she would not for the world cause him a  moment s annoyance  besides he might think she had waited on the  chance of seeing him again  that was not to be borne      i will return and take my trunks   she said  and a carriage was  called     there was something very exhilarating in driving through the streets  of paris  alone  in a nice little carriage with fat pneumatic tires   the street lamps were alight  and the shops not yet closed  almost  every house seemed to be a shop      i wonder where all the people live   said betty     the place de la concorde delighted her with its many lamps and its  splendid space      how glorious it would be to live alone in paris   she thought   be  driven about in cabs just when one liked and where one liked  oh  i am  tired of being a school girl  i suppose they won t let me be grown up  till i m so old i shall wish i was a school girl again      she loved the river with its reflected lights   but it made her  shudder  too      of course i shall never be allowed to see the morgue   she said    they won t let me see anything real  even this little teeny tiny bit  of a drive  i daresay it s not comme il faut  i do hope madame won t  be furious  she couldn t expect me to wait forever  perhaps  too   she s ill  and no one to look after her  oh  i m sure i m right to  go      the doubt  however  grew as the carriage jolted through narrower  streets  and when it drew up at an open carriage door  betty jumped  out  paid the coachman  and went in quite prepared to be scolded     she went through the doorway and stood looking for the list of names  such as are set at the foot of the stairs leading to flats in london   there was no such list  from a lighted doorway on the right came a  babel of shrill  high pitched voices  betty looked in at the door and  the voices ceased      pardon  madame   said betty   i seek madame gautier      everyone in the crowded stuffy lamplit little room drew a deep breath      mademoiselle is without doubt one of madame s young ladies      perhaps it was the sudden hushing of the raised voices  perhaps it was  something in the flushed faces that all turned towards her  to her  dying day betty will never know why she did not say  yes   what she  did say was      i am a friend of madame s  is she at home       no  mademoiselle   she is not at home  she will never be at home  more  the poor lady  she is dead  mademoiselle  an accident  one of  those cursed automobiles ran over her at her very door  mademoiselle   before our eyes      betty felt sick      thank you   she said   it is very sudden       will mademoiselle leave her name   the concierge asked curiously    the brother of madame  he is in the commerce at nantes  a telegramme  has been sent  he arrives to morrow morning  he will give mademoiselle  details      again betty said what she had not intended to say  she said      miss brown   perhaps the brother in the commerce vaguely suggested  the addition   of manchester      then she turned away  and got out of the light into the friendly dusk  of the street      tiens  but it is droll   said the concierge s friend   a young girl   and all alone like that       oh  it is nothing   said the concierge   the english are mad  all   their young girls run the streets at all hours  and the devil guards  them      betty stood in the street  she could not go back to that circle of  harpy faces  all eagerly tearing to pieces the details of poor old  madame gautier s death  she must be alone  think  she would have to  write home  her father would come to fetch her  her aunt was beyond  the reach of appeal  her artist life would be over  everything would  be over  she would be dragged back to the parishing and the mothers   meetings and the black cotton covered books and the sunday school     and she would never have lived in paris at all     she walked down the street      i can t think  i  must  think  i ll have this night to myself to  think in  anyway  i ll go to some cheap hotel  i have enough for  that      she hailed a passing carriage  drove to the hotel bete  took her  luggage to the gare du nord  and left it there     then as she stood on the station step  she felt something in her hand   it was the fat letter addressed to madame gautier  and she knew it was  fat with bank notes     she unfastened her dress and thrust the letter into her bosom   buttoning the dress carefully over it      but i won t go to my hotel yet   she said   i won t even look for  one  i ll see paris a bit first      she hailed a coachman      go   she said   to some restaurant in the latin quarter  where the  art students eat       and i m alone in paris  and perfectly free   said betty  leaning back  on the cushions   no  i won t tell my coachman to drive along the rue  notre dame des champs  wherever that is  oh  it is glorious to be  perfectly free  oh  poor madame gautier  oh dear  oh dear   she held  her breath and wondered why she could feel sorry      you are a wretch   she said   poor madame was kind to you in her hard  narrow way  and now is she lying cold and dead  all broken up by that  cruel motor car      the horror of the picture helped by betty s excitement brought the  tears and she encouraged them      it is something to find one is not entirely heartless   she said at  last  drying her eyes  as the carriage drew up at a place where there  were people and voices and many lights           chapter x       seeing life     the thoughts of the two who loved her were with betty that night  the  aunt  shaken  jolted  enduring much in the paris  lyons and  mediterranean express thought fondly of her      she s a nice little thing  i must take her about a bit   she mused   and even encouraged her fancy to play with the idea of a london  season  a thing it had not done for years     the reverend cecil  curtains drawn and lamp alight  paused to think of  her even in the midst of his first thorough examination of his newest  treasure in seventeenth century tracts   the man mouse baited and  trapped for nibbling the margins of eugenius philalethes  being an  assault on henry moore   it was bound up with   the second wash  or  the moore scoured again   and a dozen others  a dumpy octavo  in brown  leather  he had found it propping a beer barrel in the next village      dear lizzie   i wonder if she will ever care for really important  things  there must be treasures upon treasures in those boxes on the  french quays that one reads about  but she never would learn to know  one type from another      he studied the fire thoughtfully      i wonder if she does understand how much she is to me   he thought    those are the things that are better unsaid  at least i always think  so when she s here  but all these months  i wonder whether girls like  you to  say things   or to leave them to be understood  it is more  delicate not to say them  perhaps      then his thoughts went back to the other lizzie  about whom he had  never felt these doubts  he had loved her  and had told her so  and  she had told him her half of the story in very simple words  and most  simply  and without at all  leaving things to be understood  they had  planned the future that never was to be  he remembered the day when  sitting over the drawing room fire  and holding her dear hand he had  said      this is how we shall sit when we are old and gray  dearest   it had  seemed so impossibly far off then     and she had said      i hope we shall die the same day  cec      but this had not happened     and he had said      and we shall have such a beautiful life  doing good  and working for  god  and bringing up our children in the right way  oh  lizzie  it s  very wonderful to think of that happiness  isn t it      and she had laid her head on his shoulder and whispered      i hope we shall have a little girl  dear      and he had said      i shall call her elizabeth  after my dear wife       she must have eyes like yours though       she will be exactly like both of us   he had said  and they sat hand  in hand  and talked innocently  like two children  of the little child  that was never to be     he had wanted them to put on her tombstone  lizzie daughter of       and affianced wife of cecil underwood  but her mother had said that   there  there was no marrying or giving in marriage  in his heart the  reverend cecil had sometimes dared to hope that that text had been  misunderstood  to him his lizzie had always been  as the angels of god  in heaven      then came the long broken years  and then the little girl  elizabeth   his step child     the pent up love of all his life spent itself on her  a love so fond   so tender  so sacred that it seemed only self respecting to hide it a  little from the world by a mask of coldness  and betty had never seen  anything but the mask      i think  when i see her  i will tell her all about my lizzie   he  said   i wonder if she knows what the house is like without her  but  of course she doesn t  or she would have asked to come home  long ago   i wonder whether she misses me very much  madame gautier is kind  she  says  but no stranger can make a home  as love can make it      meanwhile betty dining alone at a restaurant in the boulevard st   michel  within a mile of the serpent  ordered what she called a nice  dinner  it was mostly vegetables and sweet things  and ate it with  appetite  looking about her  the long mirrors  the waiters were like  the ones in london restaurants  but the people who ate there they were  different  everything was much shabbier  yet much gayer   shopkeeping looking men were dining with their wives  some of them had  a child  napkin under chin  solemnly struggling with a big soup spoon  or upturning on its little nose a tumbler of weak red wine and water   there were students  she knew them by their slouched hats and beards a  day old  dining by twos and threes and fours  no one took any more  notice of betty than was shewn by a careless glance or two  she was  very quietly dressed  her hat even was rather an unbecoming brown  thing  when she had eaten  she ordered coffee  and began to try to  think  but thinking was difficult with the loud voices and the  laughter  and the clink of glasses and the waiters  hurrying transits   and at the back of her mind was a thought waiting for her to think it   and she was afraid     so presently she paid her bill  and went out  and found a tram  and  rode on the top of it through the lighted streets  on the level of the  first floor windows and the brown leaves of the trees in the  boulevards  and went away and away through the heart of paris  and  still all her mind could do nothing but thrust off  with both hands   the thought that was pushing forward towards her thinking  when the  tram stopped at its journey s end she did not alight  but paid for   and made  the return journey  and found her feet again in the  boulevard st  michel     of course  she had read her trilby  and other works dealing with the  latin quarter  she knew that in that quarter everyone is not  respectable  but everyone is kind  it seemed good to her to go to a  cafe  to sit at a marble topped table  and drink  not the strange  liqueurs which men drink in books  but homely hot milk  such as some  of the other girls there had before them  it would be perfectly  simple  as well as interesting  to watch the faces of the students   boys and girls  and when she found a nice girl face  to speak to it   asking for the address of a respectable hotel     so she walked up the wide  tree planted street feeling very parisian  indeed  as she called it the  boule miche  to herself  and she stopped  at the first cafe she came to  which happened to be the cafe  d harcourt     she did not see its name  and if she had it would naturally not have  conveyed any idea to her  the hour was not yet ten  and the cafe  d harcourt was very quiet  there were not a dozen people at the little  tables  most of them were women  it would be easy to ask her little  questions  with so few people to stare and wonder if she addressed a  stranger     she sat down  and ordered her hot milk and  with a flutter  awaited  it  this was life  and to morrow she must telegraph to her  step father  and everything would end in the old round of parish  duties  all her hopes and dreams would be submerged in the heavy  morass of meeting mothers  the thought leapt up   betty hid her eyes  and would not look at it  instead  she looked at the other people  seated at the tables  the women  they were laughing and talking among  themselves  one or two looked at betty and smiled with frank  friendliness  betty smiled back  but with embarrassment  she had heard  that french ladies of rank and fashion would as soon go out without  their stockings as without their paint  but she had not supposed that  the practice extended to art students  and all these ladies were  boldly painted  no mere soupcon of carmine and pearl powder  but good  solid masterpieces in body colour  black  white and red  she smiled in  answer to their obvious friendliness  but she did not ask them for  addresses  a handsome black browed scowling woman sitting alone  frowned at her  she felt quite hurt  why should anyone want to be  unkind     men selling flowers  toy rabbits  rattling cardboard balls  offered  their wares up and down the row of tables  betty bought a bunch of  fading late roses and thought  with a sudden sentimentality that  shocked her  of the monthly rose below the window at home  it always  bloomed well up to christmas  well  in two days she would see that  rose bush     the trams rattled down the boulevard  carriages rolled by  every now  and then one of these would stop  and a couple would alight  and  people came on foot  the cafe was filling up  but still none of the  women seemed to betty exactly the right sort of person to know exactly  the right sort of hotel     of course she knew from books that hotels keep open all night   but  she did not happen to have read any book which told of the reluctance  of respectable hotels to receive young women without luggage  late in  the evening  so it seemed to her that there was plenty of time     a blonde girl with jet black brows and eyes like big black beads was  leaning her elbows on her table and talking to her companions  two  tourist looking germans in loud checks  they kept glancing at betty   and it made her nervous to know that they were talking about her  at  last her eyes met the eyes of the girl  who smiled at her and made a  little gesture of invitation to her  to come and sit at their table   betty out of sheer embarrassment might have gone  but just at that  moment the handsome scowling woman rose  rustled quickly to betty   knocking over a chair in her passage  held out a hand  and said in  excellent english      how do you do      betty gave her hand  but  i don t remember you   said she      may i join you   said the woman sitting down  she wore black and  white and red  and she was frightfully smart  betty thought  she  glanced at the others  the tourists and the blonde  they were no  longer looking at her      look here   said the woman  speaking low   i don t know you from  adam  of course  but i know you re a decent girl  for god s sake go  home to your friends  i don t know what they re about to let you out  alone like this       i m alone in paris just now   said betty      good god in heaven  you little fool  get back to your lodging  you ve  no business here       i ve as much business as anyone else   said betty   i m an artist   too  and i want to see life       you ve not seen much yet   said the woman with a laugh that betty  hated to hear   have you been brought up in a convent  you an artist   look at all of us  do you need to be told what  our  trade is       don t   said betty   oh  don t       go home   said the woman   and say your prayers  i suppose you  do   say your prayers   and thank god that it isn t your trade too       i don t know what you mean   said betty      well then  go home and read your bible  that ll tell you the sort of  woman it is that stands about the corners of streets  or sits at the  cafe d harcourt  what are your people about       my father s in england   said betty   he s a clergyman       i generally say mine was   said the other   but i won t to you   because you d believe me  my father was church organist  though  and  the vicarage people were rather fond of me  i used to do a lot of  parish work   she laughed again     betty laid a hand on the other woman s      couldn t you go home to your father  or  something   she asked  feebly      he s cursed me forever  put it all down in black and white  a regular  commination service  it s you that have got to go home  and do it   now   too   she shook off betty s hand and waved her own to a man who  was passing      here  mr  temple       the man halted  hesitated and came up to them      look here   said the black browed woman   look what a pretty flower  i ve found   and here of all places      she indicated betty by a look  the man looked too  and took the third  chair at their table  betty wished that the ground might open and  cover her  but the boule miche asphalt is solid  the new comer was  tall and broad shouldered  with a handsome  serious  boyish face  and  fair hair      she won t listen to me        oh  i did   betty put in reproachfully      you talk to her like a father  tell her where naughty little girls go  who stay out late at the cafe d harcourt  fire and brimstone  you  know  she ll understand  she s a clergyman s daughter       i really do think you d better go home   said the new comer to betty  with gentle politeness      i would  directly   said betty  almost in tears   but  the fact is i  haven t settled on a hotel  and i came to this cafe  i thought i could  ask one of these art students to tell me a good hotel  but  so that s  how it is       i should think not   temple answered the hiatus  then he looked at  the black browed  scowling woman  and his look was very kind      nini and her german swine were beginning to be amiable   said the  woman in an aside which betty did not hear   for christ s sake take  the child away  and put her safely for the night somewhere  if you  have to ring up a mother superior or a governesses  aid society       right  i will   he turned to betty      will you allow me   he said   to find a carriage for you  and see you  to a hotel       thank you   said betty     he went out to the curbstone and scanned the road for a passing  carriage      look here   said the black browed woman  turning suddenly on betty    i daresay you ll think it s not my place to speak  oh  if you don t  think so you will some day  when you re grown up   but look here  i m  not chaffing  it s deadly earnest  you be good  see  there s nothing  else that s any good really       yes   said betty   i know  if you re not good you won t be happy       there you go   the other answered almost fiercely   it s always the  way  everyone says it  copybooks and bible and everything  and no one  believes it till they ve tried the other way  and then it s no use  believing anything       oh  yes  it is   said betty comfortingly   and you re so kind  i  don t know how to thank you  being kind  is  being good too  isn t  it       well  you aren t always a devil  even if you are in hell  i wish i  could make you understand all the things i didn t understand when i  was like you  but nobody can  that s part of the hell  and you don t  even understand half i m saying       i think i do   said betty      keep straight   the other said earnestly   never mind how dull it is   i used to think it must be dull in heaven  god knows it s dull in the  other place  look  he s got a carriage  you can trust him just for  once  but as a rule i d say  don t you trust any of them  they re all  of a piece   good bye  you re a nice little thing       good bye   said betty   oh  good bye  you  are  kind  and good   people can t all be good the same way   she added  vaguely and seeking  to comfort      women can   said the other   don t you make any mistake  good bye      she watched the carriage drive away  and turned to meet the spiteful  chaff of nini and her german friends      now   said mr  temple  as soon as the wheels began to revolve    perhaps you will tell me how you come to be out in paris alone at  this hour      betty stared at him coldly      i shall be greatly obliged if you can recommend me a good hotel   she  said      i don t even know your name   said he      no   she answered briefly      i cannot advise you unless you will trust me a little   he said  gently      you are very kind   but i have not yet asked for anyone s advice       i am sorry if i have offended you   he said   but i only wish to be  of service to you       illustration   she stared at him coldly       thank you very much   said betty   the only service i want is the  name of a good hotel       you are unwise to refuse my help   he said   the place where i found  you shews that you are not to be trusted about alone       look here   said betty  speaking very fast   i dare say you mean  well  but it isn t your business  the lady i was speaking to        that just shews   he said      she was very kind  and i like her  but i don t intend to be  interfered with by any strangers  however well they mean      he laughed for the first time  and she liked him better when she had  heard the note of his laughter      please forgive me   he said   you are quite right  miss conway is  very kind  and i really do want to help you  and i don t want to be  impertinent  may i speak plainly       of course       well the cafe d harcourt is not a place for a respectable girl to go  to       i gathered that   she answered quietly   i won t go there again       have you quarreled with your friends   he persisted   have you run  away       no   said betty  and on a sudden inspiration  added   i m very  very  tired  you can ask me any questions you like in the morning  now  will  you please tell the man where to go      the dismissal was unanswerable     he took out his card case and scribbled on a card      where is your luggage   he asked      not here   she said briefly      i thought not   he smiled again   i am discerning  am i not  well   perhaps you didn t know that respectable hotels prefer travellers who  have luggage  but they know me at this place  i have said you are my  cousin   he added apologetically     he stopped the carriage   hotel de l unicorne   he told the driver and  stood bareheaded till she was out of sight     the thought came out and said   there will be an end of me if you see  that well meaning person again   betty would not face the thought  but  she was roused to protect it     she stood up and touched the coachman on the arm      go back to the cafe d harcourt   she said   i have forgotten  something      that was why  when temple called  very early  at the hotel de  l unicorne he heard that his cousin had not arrived there the night  before  had not  indeed  arrived at all     he shrugged his shoulders      it s a pity   he said   certainly she had run away from home  i  suppose i frightened her  i was always a clumsy brute with women            chapter xi       the thought     the dark haired woman was still ably answering the chaff of nini and  the germans  and her face was not the face she had shewn to betty   betty came quietly behind her and touched her shoulder  she leapt in  her chair and turned white under the rouge      what the devil   you shouldn t do that   she said roughly   you  frightened me out of my wits       i m so sorry   said betty  who was pale too   come away  won t you  i  want to talk to you       your little friend is charming   said one of the men in thick  german french   may i order for her a bock or a cerises       do come   she urged      let s walk   she said   what s the matter  where s young temple   don t tell me he s like all the others       he meant to be kind   said betty   but he asked a lot of questions   and i don t want to know him  i like you better  isn t there anywhere  we can be quiet  and talk  i m all alone here in paris  and i do want  help  and i d rather you d help me than anyone else  can t i come home  with you       no you can t       well then  will you come with me   not to the hotel he told me of   but to some other  you must know of one       what will you do if i don t       i don t know   said betty very forlornly   but you  will   won t you   you don t know how tired i am  come with me  and then in the morning  we can talk  do  do      the other woman took some thirty or forty steps in silence  then she  asked abruptly      have you plenty of money       yes  lots       and you re an artist       yes  at least i m a student      again the woman reflected  at last she shrugged her shoulders and  laughed   set a thief to catch a thief   she said   i shall make a  dragon of a chaperon  i warn you  yes  i ll come  just for this one  night  but you ll have to pay the hotel bill       of course   said betty      this  is  an adventure  where s your luggage       it s at the station  but i want you to promise not to tell that  temple man a word about me  i don t want to see him again  promise       queer child  but i ll promise  now look here  if i go into a thing at  all i go into it heart and soul  so let s do the thing properly  we  must have some luggage  i ve got an old portmanteau knocking about   will you wait for me somewhere while i get it       i d rather not   said betty  remembering the germans and nini      well then   there d be no harm for a few minutes  you can come with  me  this is really rather a lark      five minutes  walking brought the two to a dark house  the woman rang  a bell  a latch clicked and a big door swung open  she grasped betty s  hand      don t say a word   she said  and pulled her through     it was very dark     the other woman called out a name as they passed the door of the  concierge  a name that was not conway  and her hand pulled betty up  flight after flight of steep stairs  on the fifth floor she opened a  door with a key  and left betty standing at the threshold till she had  lighted a lamp     then  come in   she said  and shut the door and bolted it     the room was small and smelt of white rose scent  the looking glass  had a lace drapery fastened up with crushed red roses  and there were  voluminous lace and stuff curtains to bed and window      sit down   said the hostess  she took off her hat and pulled the  scarlet flowers from it  she washed her face till it shewed no rouge  and no powder  and the brown of lashes and brows was free from the  black water paint  she raked under the bed with a faded sunshade till  she found an old brown portmanteau  her smart black and white dress  was changed for a black one  of a mode passee these three years  a  gray chequered golf cape and the dulled hat completed the  transformation      how nice you look   said betty     the other bundled some linen and brushes into the portmanteau      the poor old gladstone s very thin still   she said  and folded  skirts   we must plump it out somehow      when the portmanteau was filled and strapped  they carried it down  between them  in the dark  and got it out on to the pavement      i am miss conway now   said the woman   and we will drive to the  hotel de lille  i went there one easter with my father      with the change in her dress a change had come over miss conway s  voice     at the hotel de lille it was she who ordered the two rooms   communicating  for herself and her cousin  explained where the rest of  the luggage was  and gave orders for the morning chocolate      this is very jolly   said betty  when they were alone   it s like an  elopement       exactly   said miss conway   good night       it s rather like a dream  though  i shan t wake up and find you gone   shall i   betty asked anxiously      no  no  we ve all your affairs to settle in the morning       and yours       mine were settled long ago  oh  i forgot  i m miss conway  at the  hotel de lille  yes  we ll settle my affairs in the morning  too  good  night  little girl       good night  miss conway       they call me lotty       my name s betty and  look here  i can t wait till the morning   betty  clasped her hands  and seemed to be holding her courage between them    i ve come to paris to study art  and i want you to come and live with  me  i know you d like it  and i ve got heaps of money  will you      she spoke quickly and softly  and her face was flushed and her eyes  bright     there was a pause      you silly little duffer  you silly dear little duffer      the other woman had turned away and was fingering the chains of an  ormolu candlestick on the mantelpiece     betty put an arm over her shoulders      look here   she said   i m not such a duffer as you think  i know  people do dreadful things  but they needn t go on doing them  need  they       yes  they need   said the other   that s just it      her fingers were still twisting the bronze chains      and the women you talked about  in the bible  they weren t kind and  good  like you  they were just only horrid and not anything else  you  told  me  to be good  won t you let me help you  oh  it does seem such  cheek of me  but i never knew anyone before who  i don t know how to  say it  but i am so sorry  and i want you to be good  just as much as  you want me to  dear  dear lotty       my name s paula       paula dear  i wish i wasn t so stupid  but i know it s not your  fault  and i know you aren t like that woman with the germans       i should hope not indeed   paula was roused to flash back   dirty  little french gutter cat       i ve never been a bit of good to anyone   said betty  adding her  other arm and making a necklace of the two round paula s neck   except  to parishioners perhaps  do let me be a bit of good to you  don t you  think i could       you dear little fool   said paula gruffly      yes  but say yes  you must  i know you want to  i ve got lots of  money  kiss me  paula       i won t   don t kiss me   i won t have it  go away   said the woman   clinging to betty and returning her kisses      don t cry   said betty gently   we shall be ever so happy  you ll  see  good night  paula  do you know i ve never had a friend  a  girl friend  i mean       for god s sake hold your tongue  and go to bed  good night      betty  alone  faced at last  and for the first time  the thought  but  it had changed its dress when miss conway changed hers  it was no  longer a thought  it was a resolution     twin born with her plan for saving her new friend was the plan for a  life that should not be life at long barton     all the evening she had refused to face the thought  but it had been  shaping itself to something more definite than thought  as a  resolution  a plan  it now unrolled itself before her  she sat in the  stiff arm chair looking straight in front of her  and she saw what she  meant to do  the thought had been wise not to insist too much on  recognition  earlier in the evening it would have seemed merely a  selfish temptation  now it was an opportunity for a good and noble  act  and betty had always wanted so much to be noble and good     here she was in paris  alone  her aunt  train borne  was every moment  further and further away  as for her step father      i hate him   said betty   and he hates me  he only let me come to get  rid of me  and what good could i do at long barton compared with what  i can do here  any one can do parish work  i ve got the money aunt  left for madame gautier  perhaps it s stealing  but is it  the money  was meant to pay to keep me in paris to study art  and it s not as if  i were staying altogether for selfish reasons  there s paula  i m sure  she has really a noble nature  and it s not as if i were staying  because he is in paris  of course  that would be  really wrong   but  he said he was going to vienna  i suppose his uncle delayed him  but  he ll certainly go  i m sure it s right  i ve learned a lot since i  left home  i m not a child now  i m a woman  and i must do what i  think is right  you know i must  mustn t i      she appealed to the inward monitor  but it refused to be propitiated      it only seems not quite right because it s so unusual   she went on    that s because i ve never been anywhere or done anything  after all   it s my own life  and i have a right to live it as i like  my  step father has never written to madame gautier all these months  he  won t now  it s only to tell him she has changed her address  he only  writes to me on sunday nights  there s just time  and i ll keep the  money  and when aunt comes back i ll tell her everything  she ll  understand       do you think so   said the inward monitor      any way   said betty  putting her foot down on the inward monitor    i m going to do it  if it s only for paula s sake  we ll take rooms   and i ll go to a studio  and work hard  and i won t make friends with  gentlemen i don t know  or anything silly  so there   she added  defiantly   auntie left the money for me to study in paris  if i tell  my step father that madame gautier is dead  he ll just fetch me home   and what ll become of paula then      thus and thus  ringing the changes on resolve and explanation  her  thoughts ran  a clock chimed midnight      is it possible   she asked herself   that it s not twelve hours since  i was at the hotel bete  talking to him  well  i shall never see him  again  i suppose  how odd that i don t feel as if i cared whether i  did or not  i suppose what i felt about him wasn t real  it all seems  so silly now  paula is real  and all that i mean to do for her is  real  he isn t      she prayed that night as usual  but her mind was made up  and she  prayed outside a closed door     next morning  when her chocolate came up  she carried it into the next  room  and  sitting on the edge of her new friend s bed  breakfasted  there     paula seemed dazed when she first woke  but soon she was smiling and  listening to betty s plans      how young you look   said betty   almost as young as me       i m twenty five       you don t look it  with your hair in those pretty plaits  and your  nightie  you do have lovely nightgowns       i ll get up now   said paula   look out  i nearly upset the tray      betty had carefully put away certain facts and labelled them   not to  be told to anyone  even paula   no one was to know anything about  vernon   there is nothing to know really   she told herself  no one  was to know that she was alone in paris without the knowledge of her  relations  lots of girls came to paris alone to study art  she was  just one of these     she found the lying wonderfully easy  it did not bring with it   either  any of the shame that lying should bring  but rather a sense  of triumphant achievement  as from a difficult part played  excellently     she paid the hotel bill  and then the search for rooms began      we must be very economical  you know   she said   but you won t mind  that  will you  i think it will be rather fun       it would be awful fun   said the other   you ll go and work at the  studio  and when you come home after your work i shall have cooked the  dejeuner  and we shall have it together on a little table with a nice  white cloth and a bunch of flowers on it       yes  and in the evening we ll go out  to concerts and things  and  ride on the tops of trams  and on sundays  what does one do on  sundays       i suppose one goes to church   said paula      oh  i think not when we re working so hard all the week  we ll go  into the country       we can take the river steamer and go to st  cloud  or go out on the  tram to clamart  the woods there are just exactly like the woods at  home  what part of england do you live in       kent   said betty      my home s in devonshire   said paula     it was a hard day  so many stairs to climb  so many apartments to see   and all of them either quite beyond betty s means  or else little  stuffy places  filled to choking point with the kind of furniture no  one could bear to live with  and with no light  and no outlook except  a blank wall a yard or two from the window     they kept to the montparnasse quarter  for there  paula said  were the  best ateliers for betty  they found a little restaurant  where only  art students ate  and where one could breakfast royally for about a  shilling  betty looked with interest at the faces of the students  and  wondered whether she should ever know any of them  some of them looked  interesting  a few were english  and fully half american     then the weary hunt for rooms began again     it was five o clock before a  concierge  unexpected amiable  in face  of their refusal of her rooms  asked whether they had tried madame  bianchi s  madame bianchi where the atelier was  and the students   meetings on sunday evenings   number    boulevard montparnasse     they tried it  one passes through an archway into a yard where the  machinery  of a great laundry pulses half the week  up some wide  wooden stairs  shallow  easy stairs  and on the first floor are the  two rooms  betty drew a long breath when she saw them  they were  lofty  they were airy  they were light  there was not much furniture   but what there was was good  old carved armoires  solid divans  and  joy of joys  in each room a carved oak  seventeenth century  mantelpiece eight feet high and four feet deep      i  must  have these rooms   betty whispered   oh  i could make them  so pretty      the rent of the rooms was almost twice as much as the sum they fixed  on  and paula murmured caution      its no use   said betty   we ll live on bread and water if you like   but we ll live on it  here       and she took the rooms      i m sure we ve done right   she said as they drove off to fetch her  boxes   the rooms will be like a home  you see if they aren t  and  there s a piano too  and madame bianchi  isn t she a darling  isn t  she pretty and sweet and nice       yes   said paula thoughtfully   it certainly is something that you ve  got rooms in the house of a woman like that       and that ducky little kitchen  oh  we shall have such fun  cooking  our own meals  you shall get the dejeuner but i ll cook the dinner  while you lie on the sofa and read novels  like a real lady        don t use that expression  i hate it   said paula sharply   but the  rooms are lovely  aren t they       yes  it s a good place for you to be in  i m sure of that   said the  other  musing again     when the boxes were unpacked  and betty had pinned up a few prints and  photographs and sketches and arranged some bright coloured liberty  scarves to cover the walls  more obvious defects  left by the removal  of the last tenant s decorations  when flowers were on table and  piano  the curtains drawn and the lamps lighted  the room did  indeed   look  like a home       we ll have dinner out to night   said paula   and to morrow we ll go  marketing  and find you a studio to work at       why not here       that s an idea  have you a lace collar you can lend me  this is not  fit to be seen      betty pinned the collar on her friend      i believe you get prettier every minute   she said   i must just  write home and give them my address      she fetched her embroidered blotting book      it reminds one of bazaars   said miss conway                                                      boulevard montparnasse       my dear father       this is our new address  madame gautier s tenant wanted to keep on    her flat in the rue de vaugirard  so she has taken this one which    is larger and very convenient  as it is close to many of the best    studios  i think i shall like it very much  it is not decided yet    where i am to study  but there is an atelier in the house for ladies    only  and i think it will be there  so that i shall not have to go    out to my lessons  i will write again as soon as we are more    settled  we only moved in late this afternoon  so there is a lot to    do  i hope you are quite well  and that everything is going on well    in the parish  i will certainly send some sketches for the christmas    sale  madame gautier does not wish me to go home for christmas  she    thinks it would interrupt my work too much  there is a new girl  a    miss conway  i like her very much  with love       yours affectionately       e  desmond     she was glad when that letter was written  it is harder to lie in  writing than in speech  and the use of the dead woman s name made her  shiver      but i won t do things by halves   she said      what s this   paula asked sharply  she had stopped in front of one of  betty s water colours      that  oh  i did it ages ago  before i learned anything  don t look  at it       but  what  is it       oh  only our house at home       i wonder   said paula   why all english vicarages are exactly alike       it s a rectory   said betty absently      that ought to make a difference  but it doesn t  i haven t seen an  english garden for four years       four years is a long time   said betty      you don t know how long   said the other   and the garden s been  going on just the same all the time  it seems odd  doesn t it  those  hollyhocks  the ones at the vicarage at home are just like them  come   let s go to dinner            chapter xii       the rescue     when vernon had read betty s letter  and holding it up to the light he  was able to read the scratched out words almost as easily as the  others  he decided that he might as well know where she worked  and  one day  after he had called on lady st  craye  he found himself  walking along the rue de vaugirard  lady st  craye was charming  and  she had been quite right when she had said that he would find a  special charm in the companionship of one in whose heart his past  love making seemed to have planted no thorns  yet her charm  by its  very nature  its finished elegance  its conscious authority  made him  think with the more interest of the unformed  immature grace of the  other woman  betty  in whose heart he had not had the chance to plant  either thorns or roses     how could he find out  concierges are venal  but vernon disliked base  instruments  he would act boldly  it was always the best way  he would  ask to see this madame gautier  if betty were present he must take his  chance  it would be interesting to see whether she would commit  herself to his plot by not recognizing him  if she did that  yet he  hoped she wouldn t  if she did recognize him he would say that it was  through miss desmond s relatives that he had heard of madame gautier   betty could not contradict him  he would invent a niece whose parents  wished to place her with madame  then he could ask as many questions  as he liked  about hours and studios  and all the details of the life  betty led     it was a simple straight forward design  and one that carried success  in its pocket  no one could suspect anything     yet at the very first step suspicion  or what looked like it  stared  at him from the eyes of the concierge when he asked for madame  gautier      monsieur is not of the friends of madame   she asked curiously     he knew better than to resent the curiosity  he explained that he  desired to see madame on business      you will see her never   the woman said dramatically   she sees no  one any more       is it that she is ill       it is that she is dead   and the dead do not receive  monsieur   she  laughed  and told the tale of death circumstantially  with grim relish  of detail      and the young ladies  they have returned to their parents       ah  it is in the young ladies that monsieur interests himself  but  yes  madame s brother  who is in the commerce of nantes  he restored  instantly the young ladies to their friends  one was already with her  aunt      vernon had money ready in his hand      what was her name  madame  the young lady with the aunt       but i know not  monsieur  she was a new young lady  who had been with  madame at her villa  i have not seen her  at the time of the  regrettable accident she was with her aunt  and doubtless remains  there  thank you  monsieur  that is all i know       thank you  madame  i am desolated to have disturbed you  good day      and vernon was in the street again     so betty had never come to the rue vaugirard  the aunt must somehow  have heard the news  perhaps she had called on the way to the  train  she had returned to the bete and betty now was heaven alone  knew where  perhaps at long barton  perhaps in paris  with some other  dragon     vernon for a day or two made a point of being near when the  studios  julien s  carlorossi s  delacluse s  disgorged their  students  he did not see betty  because she was not studying at any of  these places  but at the atelier bianchi  of which he never thought   so he shrugged his shoulders  and dined again with lady st  craye  and  began to have leisure to analyse the emotions with which she inspired  him  he had not believed that he could be so attracted by a woman with  whom he had played the entire comedy  from first glance to last  tear  from meeting hands to severed hearts  yet attracted he was  and  strongly  he experienced a sort of resentment  a feeling that she had  kept something from him  that she had reserves of which he knew  nothing  that he  who in his blind complacency had imagined himself to  have sucked the orange and thrown away the skin  had really  in point  of fact  had a strange lovely fruit snatched from him before his blunt  teeth had done more than nibble at its seemingly commonplace rind     in the old days she had reared barriers of reserve  walls of reticence  over which he could see so easily  now she posed as having no  reserves  and he seemed to himself to be following her through a  darkling wood  where the branches flew back and hit him in the face so  that he could not see the path      you know   she said   what makes it so delightful to talk to you is  that i can say exactly what i like  you won t expect me to be clever   or shy  or any of those tiresome things  we can be perfectly frank  with each other  and that s such a relief  isn t it       i wonder whether it would be  supposing it could be   said he     they were driving in the bois  among the autumn tinted trees where the  pale mist wreaths wandered like ghosts in the late afternoon      of course it could be  it is   she said  opening her eyes at him  under the brim of her marvel of a hat   at least it is for simple folk  like me  why don t you wear a window in your breast as i do      she laid her perfectly gloved hand on her sables      is there really a window  can one see into your heart        one  can  not the rest  just the one from whom one feareth nothing   expecteth nothing  hopeth nothing  that s out of the bible  isn t it       it s near enough   said he   of course  to you it s a new sensation  to have the window in your breast  whereas i  from innocent childhood  to earnest manhood  have ever been open as the day       yes   she said   you were always transparent enough  but one is so  blind when one is in love      her calm references to the past always piqued him      i don t think love is so blind as he s painted   he said   always as  soon as i begin to be in love with people i begin to see their  faults       you may be transparent  but you haven t a good mirror   she laughed    you don t see yourself as you are  it isn t when you begin to love  people that you see their faults  is it  it s really when they begin  to love you       but i never begin to love people till they begin to love me  i m too  modest       and i never love people after they ve done loving me  i m too        too what       too something  forgetful  is it  i mean it takes two to make a  quarrel  and it certainly takes two to make a love affair       and what about all the broken hearts       what broken hearts       the ones you find in the poets and the story books       that s just where you do find them  nowhere else   now  honestly  has  your heart ever been broken       not yet  so be careful how you play with it  you don t often find  such a perfect specimen  absolutely not a crack or a chip       the pitcher shouldn t crow too loud  can pitchers crow  they have  ears  of course  but only the little pitchers  the ones that go to the  well should go in modest silence       dear lady   he said almost impatiently   what is there about me that  drives my friends to stick up danger boards all along my path   this  way to destruction   you all label them  i am always being solemnly  warned that i shall get my heart broken one of these days  if i don t  look out       i wish you wouldn t call me dear lady   she said   it s not the mode  any more now       what may i call you   he had to ask  turning to look in her eyes      you needn t call me anything  i hate being called names  that s a  pretty girl  not the dark one  the one with the fur hat      he turned to look     two girls were walking briskly under the falling leaves  and the one  with the fur hat was betty  but it was at the other that he gazed even  as he returned betty s prim little bow  he even turned a little as the  carriage passed  to look more intently at the tall figure in shabby  black whose arm betty held      well   said lady st  craye  breaking the silence that followed      well   said he  rousing himself  but too late   you were saying i  might call you        it s not what i was saying  it s what you were looking  who is the  girl  and why don t you approve of her companion       who says i don t wear a window in my breast   he laughed   the girl s  a little country girl i knew in england  i didn t know she was in  paris  and i thought i knew the woman  too  but that s impossible   it s only a likeness       one nice thing about me is that i never ask impertinent questions  or  hardly ever  that one slipped out and i withdraw it  i don t want to  know anything about anything and i m sorry i spoke  i see  of course   that she is a little country girl you knew in england  and that you  are not at all interested in her  how fast the leaves fall now  don t  they       no question of your s could be im  could be anything but flattering   but since you  are  interested        not at all   she said politely      oh  but do be interested   he urged  intent on checking her  inconvenient interest   because  really  it is rather interesting when  you come to think of it  i was painting my big picture  i wish you d  come and see it  by the way  will you some day  and have tea in my  studio       i should love it  when shall i come       whenever you will      he wished she would ask another question about betty  but she  wouldn t  he had to go on  a little awkwardly      well  i only knew them for a week  her and her aunt and her  father  and she s a nice  quiet little thing  the father s a  parson  all of them are all that there is of most respectable      she listened but she did not speak      and i was rather surprised to see her here  and for the moment i  thought the woman with her was  well  the last kind of woman who  could have been with her  don t you know       i see   said lady st  craye   well  it s fortunate that the dark  woman isn t that kind of woman  no doubt you ll be seeing your little  friend  you might ask her to tea when i come to see your picture       i wish i could   vernon s manner was never so frank as when he was  most on his guard   she d love to know you  i wish i could ask them to  tea  but i don t know them well enough  and their address i don t know  at all  it s a pity  she s a nice little thing      it was beautifully done  lady st  craye inwardly applauded vernon s  acting  and none the less that her own part had grown strangely  difficult  she was suddenly conscious of a longing to be alone  to let  her face go  she gave herself a moment s pause  caught at her fine  courage and said      yes  it is a pity  however  i daresay it s safer for her that you  can t ask her to tea  she  is  a nice little thing  and she might fall  in love with you  and then  your modesty appeased  you might follow  suit  isn t it annoying when one can t pick up the thread of a  conversation  all the time you ve been talking i ve been wondering  what we were talking about before i pointed out the fur hat to you   and i nearly remember  and i can t quite  that is always so worrying   isn t it      her acting was as good as his  and his perception at the moment less  clear than hers     he gave a breath of relief  it would never have done to have lady st   craye spying on him and betty  and now he knew that she was in paris  he knew too that it would be  him and betty       we were talking   he said carefully   about calling names       oh  thank you   when one can t remember those silly little things  it s like wanting to sneeze and not being able to  isn t it  but we  must turn back  or i shall be late for dinner  and i daren t think of  the names my hostess will call me then  she has a vocabulary  you  know   she named a name and vernon thought it was he who kept the talk  busy among acquaintances till the moment for parting  lady st  craye  knew that it was she     the moment betty had bowed to mr  vernon she turned her head in answer  to the pressure on her arm      who s that   her friend asked     betty named him  and in a voice genuinely unconcerned      how long have you known him       i knew him for a week last spring  he gave me a few lessons  he is a  great favourite of my aunt s  but we don t know him much  and i  thought he was in vienna       does he know where you are       no       then mind he doesn t       why       because when girls are living alone they can t be too careful   remember you re the person that s responsible for betty desmond now   you haven t your aunt and your father to take care of you       i ve got you   said betty affectionately      yes  you ve got me   said her friend     life in the new rooms was going very easily and pleasantly  betty had  covered some cushions with the soft green silk of an old evening dress  aunt julia had given her  she had bought chrysanthemums in pots  and  now all her little belongings  the same that had  given the  cachet    to her boudoir bedroom at home lay about  and here  in this foreign  setting  did really stamp the room with a pretty  delicate   conventional individuality  the embroidered blotting book  the silver  pen tray  the wicker work basket lined with blue satin  the long  worked pin cushion stuck with betty s sparkling hat pins   all these   commonplace at long barton were here not commonplace  there was  nothing of paula s lying about  she had brought nothing with her  and  had fetched nothing from her room save clothes  dresses and hats of  the plainest     the experiments in cooking were amusing  so were the marketings in odd  little shops that sold what one wanted  and a great many things that  one had never heard of  the round of concerts and theatres and  tram rides had not begun yet  in the evenings betty drew  while paula  read aloud  from the library of stray tauchnitz books betty had  gleaned from foreign book stalls  it was a very busy  pleasant  home life  and the studio life did not lack interest     betty suffered a martyrdom of nervousness when first  a little  late  she entered the atelier  it is a large light room  a  semi circular alcove at one end  hung with pleasant coloured drapery   holds a grand piano  all along one side are big windows that give on  an old garden  once a convent garden where nuns used to walk  telling  their beads  the walls are covered with sketches  posters  studies   betty looked nervously round  the scene was agitatingly unfamiliar   the strange faces  the girls in many hued painting pinafores  the  little forest of easels  and on the square wooden platform the  model  smooth  brown  with limbs set  moveless as a figure of wax     betty got to work  as soon as she knew how one began to get to work   it was her first attempt at a drawing from the life  saving certain  not unsuccessful caricatures of her fellow pupils  her professor and  her chaperon  so far she had only been set to do landscape  and  laborious drawings of casts from the antique  the work was much harder  than she had expected  and the heat was overpowering  she wondered how  these other girls could stand it  their amused  half patronising   half disdainful glances made her furious     she rubbed out most of the lines she had put in and gasped for breath     the room  the students  the naked brown girl on the model s throne   all swam before her eyes  she got to the door somehow  opened and shut  it  and found herself sitting on the top stair with closed eyelids and  heart beating heavily      illustration   betty looked nervously around  the scene was  agitatingly unfamiliar      some one held water to her lips  she was being fanned with a  handkerchief      i m all right   she said      yes  it s hotter than usual to day   said the handkerchief holder   fanning vigorously      why do they have it so hot   asked poor betty      because of the model  of course  poor thing  she hasn t got a nice  blue gown and a pinky greeny pinafore to keep her warm  we have to try  to match the garden of eden climate  when we re drawing from a girl  who s only allowed to use eve s fashion plates      betty laughed and opened her eyes      how jolly of you to come out after me   she said      oh  i was just the same at first  all right now  i ought to get back   you just sit here till you feel fit again  so long      so betty sat there on the bare wide brown stair  staring at the  window  till things had steadied themselves  and then she went back to  her work     her easel was there  and her half rubbed out drawing  no  that was not  her drawing  it was a head  vaguely but very competently sketched  a  likeness  no  a caricature  of betty herself     she looked round  one quick but quite sufficient look  the girl next  her  and the one to that girl s right  were exchanging glances  and  the exchange ceased just too late  betty saw     from then till the rest betty did not look at the model  she looked   but furtively  at those two girls  when  at the rest time  the model  stretched and yawned and got off her throne and into a striped  petticoat  most of the students took their  easy  on the stairs  among  these the two     betty  who never lacked courage  took charcoal in hand and advanced  quite boldly to the easel next to her own     how she envied the quality of the drawing she saw there  but envy does  not teach mercy  the little sketch that betty left on the corner of  the drawing was quite as faithful  and far more cruel  than the one on  her own paper  then she went on to the next easel  the few students  who were chatting to the model looked curiously at her and giggled  among themselves     when the rest was over and the model had reassumed  quite easily and  certainly  that pose of the uplifted arms which looked so difficult   the students trooped back and the two girls  betty s enemies  as she  bitterly felt  returned to their easels  they looked at their  drawings  they looked at each other  and they looked at betty  and  when they looked at her they smiled      well done   the girl next her said softly   for a tenderfoot you hit  back fairly straight  i guess you ll do       you re very kind   said betty haughtily      don t you get your quills up   said the girl   i hit first  but you  hit hardest  i don t know you   but i want to      she smiled so queer yet friendly a smile that betty s haughtiness had  to dissolve in an answering smile      my name s betty desmond   she said   i wonder why you wanted to hit a  man when he was down       my   said the girl   how was i to surmise about you being down  you  looked dandy enough  fit to lick all creation       i ve never been in a studio before   said betty  fixing fresh paper      my   said the girl again   turn the faucet off now  the model don t  like us to whisper  can t stand the draught      so betty was silent  working busily  but next day she was greeted with  friendly nods and she had some one to speak to in the rest intervals     on the third day she was asked to a studio party by the girl who had  fanned her on the stairs   and bring your friend with you   she said     but betty s friend had a headache that day  betty went alone and came  home full of the party      she s got such a jolly studio   she said   ever so high up   and  busts and casts and things  everyone was so nice to me you can t  think  it was just like what one hears of girton cocoa parties  we had  tea  such weak tea  paula  it could hardly crawl out of the teapot  we  had it out of green basins  and the loveliest cakes  there were only  two chairs  so some of us sat on the sommier and the rest on the  floor       were there any young men   asked paula      two or three very  very young ones  they came late  but they might as  well have been girls  there wasn t any flirting or nonsense of that  sort  paula  don t you think  we  might give a party  not now  but  presently  when we know some more people  do you think they d like it   or would they think it a bore       they d love it  i should think   paula looked round the room which  already she loved   and what did you all talk about       work   said betty   work and work and work and work and work   everyone talked about their work  and everyone else listened and  watched for the chance to begin to talk about theirs  this is real  life  my dear  i am so glad i m beginning to know people  miss voscoe  is very queer  but she s a dear  she s the one who caricatured me the  first day  oh  we shall do now  shan t we       yes   said the other   you ll do now       i said  we    betty corrected softly      i meant we  of course   said miss conway           chapter xiii       contrasts     vernon s idea of a studio was a place to work in  a place where there  should be room for all the tools of one s trade  and besides  a great  space to walk up and down in those moods that seize on all artists  when their work will not come as they want it     but when he gave tea parties he had store of draperies to pull out  from his carved cupboard  deeply coloured things embroidered in rich  silk and heavy gold  chinese  burmese  japanese  russian     he came in to day with an armful of fair chrysanthemums  deftly set  them in tall brazen jars  pulled out his draperies and arranged them  swiftly  there was a screen to be hung with a chinese mandarin s  dress  where  on black  gold dragons writhed squarely among blue  roses  the couch was covered by a red burnous with a gold border   there were persian praying mats to lay on the bare floor  kakemonos to  be fastened with drawing pins on the bare walls  a tea cloth worked by  russian peasants lay under the tea cups  two only  of yellow chinese  egg shell ware  his tea pot and cream jug were queen anne silver   heirlooms at which he mocked  but he saw to it that they were kept  bright     he lighted the spirit lamp      she was always confoundedly punctual   he said     but to day lady st  craye was not punctual  she arrived half an hour  late  and the delay had given her host time to think about her     he heard her voice in the courtyard at last  but the only window that  looked that way was set high in the wall of the little corridor  and  he could not see who it was to whom she was talking  and he wondered   because the inflection of her voice was english  not the exquisite  imitation of the french inflexion which he had so often admired in  her     he opened the door and went to the stair head  the voices were coming  up the steps      a caller   said vernon  and added a word or two  however little you  may be in love with a woman  two is better company than three     the voices came up  he saw the golden brown shimmer of lady st   craye s hat  and knew that it matched her hair and that there would be  violets somewhere under the brim of it  violets that would make her  eyes look violet too  she was coming up  a man just behind her  she  came round the last turn  and the man was temple      what an alpine ascent   she exclaimed  reaching up her hand so that  vernon drew her up the last three steps   we have been hunting you  together  on both the other staircases  now that the chase is ended   won t you present your friend  and i ll bow to him as soon as i m on  firm ground      vernon made the presentation and held the door open for lady st  craye  to pass  as she did so temple behind her raised eyebrows which said      am i inconvenient  shall i borrow a book or something and go      vernon shook his head  it was annoying  but inevitable  he could only  hope that lady st  craye also was disappointed      how punctual you are   he said   sit here  won t you   i hadn t  finished laying the table   he deliberately brought out four more  cups   what unnatural penetration you have  temple  how did you find  out that this is the day when i sit  at home  and wait for people to  come and buy my pictures       and no one s come   lady st  craye had sunk into the chair and was  pulling off her gloves   that s very disappointing  i thought i should  meet dozens of clever and interesting people  and i only meet two      her brilliant smile made the words seem neither banal nor impertinent     vernon was pleased to note that he was not the only one who was  disappointed      you are too kind   he said gravely     temple was looking around the room      jolly place you ve got here   he said   but it s hard to find  i  should have gone off in despair if i hadn t met lady st  craye       we kept each other s courage up  didn t we  mr  temple  it was like  arctic explorers  i was beginning to think we should have to make a  camp and cook my muff for tea      she held out the sable and vernon laid it on the couch when he had  held it to his face for a moment      i love the touch of fur   he said   and your fur is scented with the  scent of summer gardens   open jasmine muffled lattices    he quoted  softly  temple had wandered to the window      what ripping roofs   he said   can one get out on them       now what   demanded vernon    is  the hidden mainspring that impels  every man who comes into these rooms to ask  instantly  whether one  can get out on to the roof  it s only englishmen  by the way   americans never ask it  nor frenchmen       it s the exploring spirit  i suppose   said temple idly   the spirit  that has made england the empire which  et cetera       on which the sun never sets  yes  but i think the sunset would be one  of the attractions of your roof  mr  vernon       sunset is never attractive to me   said he   nor autumn  give me  sunrise  and spring       ah  yes   said lady st  craye   you only like beginnings  even  summer        even summer  as you say   he answered equably   the sketch is always  so much better than the picture       i believe that is your philosophy of life   said temple      this man   vernon explained   spends his days in doing ripping  etchings and black and white stuff and looking for my philosophy of  life       one would like to see that in black and white  will you etch it for  me  mr  temple  when you find it       i don t think the medium would be adequate   temple said   i haven t  found it yet  but i should fancy it would be rather highly coloured       iridescent  perhaps  did you ever speculate as to the colour of  people s souls  i m quite sure every soul has a colour       what is yours   asked vernon of course      i m too humble to tell you  but some souls are thick  body colour   don t you know  and some are clear like jewels       and mine s an opal  is it       with more green in it  perhaps  you know the lovely colour on the  dykes in the marshes       stagnant water  thank you       i don t know what it is  it has some hateful chemical name  i  daresay  they have vases the colour i mean  mounted in silver  at the  army and navy stores       and your soul  it is a pearl  isn t it       never  nothing opaque  if you will force my modesty to the confession  i believe in my heart that it is a sapphire  true blue  don t you  know       and temple s  but you ve not known him long enough to judge       so it s no use my saying that i am sure his soul is a dewdrop       to be dried up by the sun of life   temple questioned      no  to be hardened into a diamond  by the fire of life  no  don t  explain that dewdrops don t harden into diamonds  i know i m not  scientific  but i honestly did mean to be complimentary  isn t your  kettle boiling over  mr  vernon      lady st  craye s eyes  while they delicately condoled with vernon on  the spoiling of his tete a tete with her  were also made to indicate a  certain interest in the spoiler  temple was more than six feet high   well built  he had regular features and clear gray eyes  with well cut  cases and very long dark lashes  his mouth was firm and its lines were  good  but for his close cropped hair and for a bearing at once frank   assured  and modest  he would have been much handsomer than a man has  any need to be  but his expression saved him  no one had ever called  him a barber s block or a hairdresser s apprentice     to temple lady st  craye appeared the most charming woman he had ever  seen  it was an effect which she had the habit of producing  he had  said of her in his haste that she was all clothes and no woman  now he  saw that on the contrary the clothes were quite intimately part of the  woman  and took such value as they had  from her     she carried her head with the dainty alertness of a beautiful bird   she had a gift denied to most englishwomen  the genius for wearing  clothes  no one had ever seen her dress dusty or crushed  her hat  crooked  no uncomfortable accidents ever happened to her  blacks never  settled on her face  the buttons never came off her gloves  she never  lost her umbrella  and in the windiest weather no loose untidy wisps  escaped from her thick heavy shining hair to wander unbecomingly round  the ears that were pearly and pink like the little shells of vanessae   some of the women who hated her used to say that she dyed her hair  it  was certainly very much lighter than her brows and lashes  to day she  was wearing a corduroy dress of a gold some shades grayer than the  gold of her hair  sable trimmed it  and violet silk lined the loose  sleeves and the coat  now unfastened and thrown back  there were  as  vernon had known there would be  violets under the brim of the hat  that matched her hair     the chair in which she sat wore a chinese blue drapery  the yellow  tea cups gave the highest note in the picture      if i were whistler  i should ask you to let me paint your portrait  like that  yes  with my despicable yellow tea cup in your honourable  hand       if you were mr  whistler  or anything in the least like mr   whistler  i shouldn t be drinking tea out of your honourable tea cup    she said   do you really think  mr  temple  that one ought not to say  one doesn t like people just because they re dead      he had been thinking something a little like it      well   he said rather awkwardly   you see dead people can t hit  back       no more can live ones when you don t hit them  but only stick pins in  their effigies  i d rather speak ill of the dead than the living       yet it doesn t seem fair  somehow   temple insisted      but why  no one can go and tell the poor things what people are  saying of them  you don t go and unfold a shroud just to whisper in a  corpse s ear   it was horrid of her to say it  but i thought you ought  to know  dear    and if you did  they wouldn t lie awake at night  worrying over it as the poor live people do   no more tea  thank you       do you really think anyone worries about what anyone says       don t you  mr  temple      he reflected      he never has anything to worry about   vernon put in   no one ever  says anything unkind about him  the cruelest thing anyone ever said of  him was that he would make as excellent a husband as albert the good       the white flower of a blameless life  my felicitations   lady st   craye smiled them     temple flushed      now isn t it odd   vernon asked   that however much one plumes  oneself on one s blamelessness  one hates to hear it attributed to one  by others  one is good by stealth and blushes to find it fame  i  myself        yes   said lady st  craye with an accent of finality      what a man really likes is to be saint with the reputation of being a  bit of a devil       and a woman likes  you think  to be a bit of a devil  with the  reputation of a saint       or a bit of a saint with a reputation that rhymes to the reality   it s the reputation that s important  isn t it       isn t the inward truth the really important thing   said temple  rather heavily     lady st  craye looked at him in such a way as to make him understand  that she understood  vernon looked at them both  and turning to the  window looked out on his admired roofs      yes   she said very softly   but one doesn t talk about that  any  more than one does of one s prayers or one s love affairs      the plural vexed temple  and he told himself how unreasonable the  vexation was     lady st  craye turned her charming head to look at him  to look at  vernon  one had been in love with her  the other might be  there is in  the world no better company than this     temple  always deeply uninterested in women s clothes  was noting the  long  firm folds of her skirt  vernon had turned from the window to  approve the loving closeness of those violets against her hair  lady  st  craye in her graceful attitude of conscious unconsciousness was  the focus of their eyes      here comes a millionaire  to buy your pictures   she said  suddenly    no  a millionairess  by the sound of her high heeled  shoes  how beautiful are the feet       the men had heard nothing  but following hard on her words came the  sound of footsteps along the little corridor  an agitated knock on the  door     vernon opened the door  to betty      oh  come in   he said cordially  and his pause of absolute  astonishment was brief as an eye flash   this is delightful       and as she passed into the room he caught her eyes and  looking a  warning  said   i am so glad to see you  i began to be afraid you  wouldn t be able to come       i saw you in the bois the other day   said lady st  craye   and i  have been wanting to know you ever since       you are very kind   said betty  her hat was on one side  her hair was  very untidy  and it was not a becoming untidiness either  she had no  gloves  and a bit of the velvet binding of her skirt was loose  her  eyes were red and swollen with crying  there was a black smudge on her  cheek      take this chair   said vernon  and moved a comfortable one with its  back to the light      temple  let me present you to miss desmond      temple bowed  with no flicker of recognition visible in his face  but  betty  flushing scarlet  said      mr  temple and i have met before      there was the tiniest pause  then temple said   i am so glad to meet  you again  i thought you had perhaps left paris       let me give you some tea   said vernon     tea was made for her   and conversation  she drank the tea  but she  seemed not to know what to do with the conversation     it fluttered  aimlessly  like a bird with a broken wing  lady st   craye did her best  but talk is not easy when each one of a party has  its own secret pre occupying interest  and an overlapping interest in  the preoccupation of the others  the air was too electric     lady st  craye had it on her lips that she must go  when betty rose  suddenly      good bye   she said generally  looking round with miserable eyes that  tried to look merely polite      must you go   asked vernon  furious with the complicated emotions  that  warring in him  left him just as helpless as anyone else      i do hope we shall meet again   said lady st  craye      mayn t i see you home   asked temple unexpectedly  even to himself     betty s  no  thank you   was most definite     she went  vernon had to let her go  he had guests  he could not leave  them  he had lost wholly his ordinary control of circumstances  all  through the petrifying awkwardness of the late talk he had been  seeking an excuse to go with betty  to find out what was the matter     he closed the door and came back  there was no help for it     but there was help  lady st  craye gave it  she rose as vernon came  back      quick   she said   shall we go  hadn t you better bring her back  here  go after her at once       you re an angel   said vernon   no  don t go  temple  look after lady  st  craye  if you ll not think me rude   miss desmond is in trouble   i m afraid       of course she is  poor little thing  oh  mr  vernon  do run  she  looks quite despairing  there s your hat  go  go      the door banged behind her     the other two  left alone  looked at each other      i wonder    said she      yes   said he   it s certainly mysterious       we ought to have gone at once   said she   i should have done  of  course  only mr  vernon so elaborately explained that he expected her   one had to play up  and so she s a friend of yours       she s not a friend of mine   said temple rather ruefully   and i  didn t know vernon was a friend of hers  you saw that she wouldn t  have my company at any price       mr  vernon s a friend of her people  i believe  we saw her the other  day in the bois  and he told me he knew them in england  did you know  them there too  poor child  what a woe begone little face it was       no  not in england  i met her in paris about a fortnight ago  but she  didn t like me  from the first  and our acquaintance broke off short      there was a silence  lady st  craye perceived a ring fence of  reticence round the subject that interested her  and knew that she had  no art strong enough to break it down     she spoke again suddenly      do you know you re not a bit the kind of man i expected you to be   mr  temple  i ve heard so much of you from mr  vernon  we re such old  friends  you know       apparently he can t paint so well with words as he does with oils   may i ask exactly how flattering the portrait was       it wasn t flattering at all   in fact it wasn t a portrait       a caricature       but you don t mind what people say of you  do you       you are trying to frighten me       no  really   she said with pretty earnestness   it s only that he has  always talked about you as his best friend  and i imagined you would  be like him      temple s uneasy wonderings about betty s trouble  her acquaintance  with vernon  the meaning of her visit to him  were pushed to the back  of his mind      i wish i were like him   said he    at any rate  in his paintings       at any rate  yes  but one can t have everything  you know  you have  qualities which he hasn t  qualities that you wouldn t exchange for  any qualities of his       that wasn t what i meant  i  the fact is  i like old vernon  but i  can t understand him       that philosophy of life eludes you still  now  i understand him  but  i don t always like him  not all of him       i wonder whether anyone understands him       he s not such a sphinx as he looks   her tone betrayed a slight  pique   now  your character would be much harder to read  that s one  of the differences       we are all transparent enough  to those who look through the right  glasses   said temple   and part of my character is my inability to  find any glass through which i could see him clearly      this comparison of his character and vernon s  with its sudden  assumption of intimacy  charmed yet embarrassed him     she saw both emotions and pitied him a little  but it was necessary to  interest this young man enough to keep him there till vernon should  return  then vernon would see her home  and she might find out  something  however little  about betty  but if this young man went she  too must go  she could not outstay him in the rooms of his friend  so  she talked on  and temple was just as much at her mercy as betty had  been at the mercy of the brother artist in the rabbit warren at long  barton     but at seven o clock vernon had not returned  and it was  after all   temple who saw her home     temple  free from the immediate enchantment of her presence  felt the  revival of a resentful curiosity     why had betty refused his help  why had she sought vernon s  why did  women treat him as though he were a curate and vernon as though he  were a god  well  lady st  craye at least had not treated him as  curates are treated           chapter xiv       renunciation     vernon tore down the stairs three and four at a time  and caught betty  as she was stepping into a hired carriage      what is it   he asked   what s the matter       oh  go back to your friends   said betty angrily      my friends are all right  they ll amuse each other  tell me       then you must come with me   said she   if i try to tell you here i  shall begin to cry again  don t speak to me  i can t bear it      he got into the carriage  it was not until betty had let herself into  her room and he had followed her in  not till they stood face to face  in the middle of the carpet that he spoke again      now   he said   what is it  where s your aunt  and        sit down  won t you   she said  pulling off her hat and throwing it  on the couch   it ll take rather a long time to tell  but i must tell  you all about it  or else you can t help me  and if you don t help me  i don t know what i shall do      despair was in her voice     he sat down  betty  in the chair opposite his  sat with hands  nervously locked together      look here   she said abruptly   you re sure to think that everything  i ve done is wrong  but it s no use your saying so       i won t say so       well  then  that day  you know  after i saw you at the bete  madame  gautier didn t come to fetch me  and i waited  and waited  and at last  i went to her flat  and she was dead   and i ought to have telegraphed  to my step father to fetch me  but i thought i would like to have one  night in paris first  you know i hadn t seen paris at all  really       yes   he said  trying not to let any anxiety into his voice   yes  go  on       and i went to the cafe d harcourt  what did you say       nothing       i thought it was where the art students went  and i met a girl there   and she was kind to me       what sort of a girl  not an art student       no   said betty hardly   she wasn t an art student  she told me what  she was       yes       and i  i don t think i should have done it just for me alone  but  i  did want to stay in paris and work  and i wanted to help her to be  good  she  is  good really  in spite of everything  oh  i know you re  horribly shocked  but i can t help it  and now she s gone   and i  can t find her       i m not shocked   he said deliberately   but i m extremely stupid   how gone       she was living with me here   oh  she found the rooms and showed me  where to go for meals and gave me good advice  oh  she did everything  for me  and now she s gone  and i don t know what to do  paris is such  a horrible place  perhaps she s been kidnapped or something  and i  don t know even how to tell the police  and all this time i m talking  to you is wasted time       it isn t wasted  but i must understand  you met this girl and she        she asked your friend mr  temple  he was passing and she called out  to him  to tell me of a decent hotel  but he asked so many questions   he gave me an address and i didn t go  i went back to her  and we went  to a hotel and i persuaded her to come and live with me       but your aunt      betty explained about her aunt      and your father      she explained about her father      and now she has gone  and you want to find her       want to find her    betty started up and began to walk up and down  the room    i don t care about anything else in the world  she s a  dear  you don t know what a dear she is  and i know she was happy  here  and now she s gone  i never had a girl friend before  what      vernon had winced  just as paula had winced  and at the same words      you ve looked for her at the cafe d harcourt       no  i promised her that i d never go there again       she seems to have given you some good advice       she advised me not to have anything to do with  you   said betty   suddenly spiteful      that was good advice  when she gave it   said vernon  quietly   but  now it s different      he was silent a moment  realising with a wonder beyond words how  different it was  every word  every glance between him and betty had   hitherto  been part of a play  she had been a charming figure in a  charming comedy  he had known  as it were by rote  that she had  feelings  a heart  affections  but they had seemed pale  dream like   just a delightful background to his own sensations  strong and  conscious and delicate  now for the first time he perceived her as  real  a human being in the stress of a real human emotion  and he was  conscious of a feeling of protective tenderness  a real  open air  primitive sentiment  with no smell of the footlights about it  he was  alone with betty  he was the only person in paris to whom she could  turn for help  what an opportunity for a fine scene in his best  manner  and he found that he did not want a scene  he wanted to help  her      why don t you say something   she said impatiently   what am i to  do       you can t do anything  i ll do everything  you say she knows temple   well  i ll find him  and we ll go to her lodgings and find out if  she s there  you don t know the address       no   said betty   i went there  but it was at night and i don t even  know the street       now look here   he took both her hands and held them firmly   you  aren t to worry  i ll do everything  perhaps she has been taken ill   in that case  when we find her  she ll need you to look after her  you  must rest  i m certain to find her  you must eat something  i ll send  you in some dinner  and then lie down       i couldn t sleep   said betty  looking at him with the eyes of a  child that has cried its heart out      of course you couldn t  lie down  and make yourself read  i ll get  back as soon as i can  good bye   there was something further that  wanted to get itself said  but the words that came nearest to  expressing it were  god bless you    and he did not say them     on the top of his staircase he found temple lounging      hullo  still here  i m afraid i ve been a devil of a time gone  but  miss desmond s        i don t want to shove my oar in   said temple   but i came back when  i d seen lady st  craye home  i hope there s nothing wrong with miss  desmond       come in   said vernon   i ll tell you the whole thing      they went into the room desolate with the disorder of half empty cups  and scattered plates with crumbs of cake on them      miss desmond told me about her meeting you  well  she gave you the  slip  she went back and got that woman  lottie what s her name  and  took her to live with her       good god  she didn t know  of course       but she did know  that s the knock down blow  she knew  and she  wanted to save her      temple was silent a moment      i say  you know  though  that s rather fine   he said presently      oh  yes   said vernon impatiently   it s very romantic and all that   well  the woman stayed a fortnight and disappeared to day  miss  desmond is breaking her heart about her       so she took her up  and  she s rather young for rescue work       rescue work  bah  she talks of the woman as the only girl friend  she s ever had  and the woman s probably gone off with her watch and  chain and a collection of light valuables  only i couldn t tell miss  desmond that  so i promised to try and find the woman  she s a  thorough bad lot  i ve run up against her once or twice with chaps i  know       she s not  that  sort   said temple   i know her fairly well       what  sir galahad  oh  i won t ask inconvenient questions   vernon s  sneer was not pretty      she used to live with de villermay   said temple steadily   he was  the first  the usual coffee maker business  you know  though god knows  how an english girl got into it  when he went home to be married  it  was rather beastly  the father came up  offered her a present  she  threw it at him  then schauermacher wanted her to live with him  no   she d go to the devil her own way  and she s gone       can t something be done   said vernon      i ve tried all i know  you can save a woman who doesn t know where  she s going  not one who knows and means to go  besides  she s been at  it six months  she s past reclaiming now       i wonder   said vernon  and his sneer had gone and he looked ten  years younger   i wonder whether anybody s past reclaiming  do you  think i am  or you      the other stared at him      well   vernon s face aged again instantly   the thing is  we ve got  to find the woman       to get her to go back and live with that innocent girl       lord  no  to find her  to find out why she bolted  and to make  certain that she won t go back and live with that innocent girl  do  you know her address      but she was not to be found at her address  she had come back  paid  her bill  and taken away her effects     it was at the cafe d harcourt  after all  that they found her  one of  a party of four  she nodded to them  and presently left her party and  came to spread her black and white flounces at their table      what s the best news with you   she asked gaily   it s a hundred  years since i saw you  bobby  and at least a million since i saw your  friend       the last time i saw you   temple said   was the night when you asked  me to take care of a girl       so it was  and did you       no   said temple   she wouldn t let me  she went back to you       so you ve seen her again  oh  i see  you ve come to ask me what i  meant by daring to contaminate an innocent girl by my society   well   you can go to hell  and ask there      she rose  knocking over a chair      don t go   said vernon   that s not what we want to ask         we   too   she turned fiercely on him   as if you were a king or a  deputation       one and one  are  two   said vernon   and i did very much want to  talk to you       and two are company      she had turned her head away      you aren t going to be cruel   vernon asked      well  send him off then  i won t be bullied by a crowd of you      temple took off his hat and went      i ve got an appointment  i ve no time for fool talk   she said      sit down   said vernon   first i want to thank you for the care  you ve taken of miss desmond  and for all your kindness and goodness  to her       oh   was all paula could say  she had expected something so  different   i don t see what business it is of yours  though   she  added next moment      only that she s alone here  and i m the only person she knows in  paris  and i know  much better than she does  all that you ve done for  her sake       i did it for my own sake  it was no end of a lark   said paula  eagerly   that little dull pious life  and all the time i used to  laugh inside to think what a sentimental fool she was       yes   said vernon slowly   it must have been amusing for you       i just did it for the fun of the thing  but i couldn t stand it any  longer  so i just came away  i was bored to death       yes   he said   you must have been  just playing at cooking and  housework  reading aloud to her while she drew  yes  she told me that   and the flowers and all her little trumpery odds and ends about   awfully amusing it must have been       don t   said paula      and to have her loving you and trusting you as she did  awfully  comic  wasn t it  calling you her girl friend        shut up  will you       and thinking she had created a new heaven and a new earth for you   silly sentimental little school girl       will you hold your tongue       so long  lottie   cried the girl of her party   we re off to the  bullier  you ve got better fish to fry  i see       yes   said paula with sudden effrontery   perhaps we ll look in  later      the others laughed and went      now   she said  turning furiously on vernon   will you go  or shall  i  i don t want any more of you       just one word more   he said with the odd change of expression that  made him look young   tell me why you left her  she s crying her eyes  out for you       why i left her  because i was sick of        don t  let me tell you  you went with her because she was alone and  friendless  you found her rooms  you set her in the way of making  friends  and when you saw that she was in a fair way to be happy and  comfortable  you came away  because        because   she leaned forward eagerly      because you were afraid       afraid       afraid of handicapping her  you knew you would meet people who knew  you  you gave it all up  all the new life  the new chances  for her  sake  and came away  do i understand  is it fool talk      paula leaned her elbows on the table and her chin on her hands      you re not like most men   she said   you make me out better than i  am  that s not the usual mistake  yes  it  was  all that  partly  and  i should have liked to stay  for ever and ever  if i could  but  suppose i couldn t  suppose i d begun to find myself wishing for  all  sorts of things  longing for them  suppose i d stayed till i began to  think of things that i  wouldn t  think of while  she  was with me    that s  what i was afraid of       and you didn t long for the old life at all      she laughed   long for that  but i might have  i might have  it was  safer   well  go back to her and tell her i ve gone to the devil and  it s not her fault  tell her i wasn t worth saving  but i did try to  save her  if you re half a man you won t undo my one little bit of  work       what do you mean       you know well enough what i mean  let the girl alone      he leaned forward  and spoke very earnestly   look here   he said   i  won t jaw  but this about you and her  well  it s made a difference to  me that i can t explain  and i wouldn t own that to anyone but  her   friend  i mean to be a friend to her too  a good friend  no nonsense       swear it by god in heaven   she said fiercely      i do swear it   he said   by god in heaven  and i can t tell her  you ve gone to the devil  you must write to her  and you can t tell  her that either       what s the good of writing       a lie or two isn t much  when you ve done all this for her  come up  to my place  you can write to her there      this was the letter that paula wrote in vernon s studio  among the  half empty cups and the scattered plates with cake crumbs on them        my dear little betty        i must leave without saying good bye  and i shall never see you    again  my father has taken me back  i wrote to him and he came and    found me  he has forgiven me everything  only i have had to promise    never to speak to anyone i knew in paris  it is all your doing     dear  god bless you  you have saved me  i shall pray for you every    day as long as i live        your poor       paula       will that do   she laughed as she held out the letter     he read it  and he did not laugh      yes  that ll do   he said   i ll tell her you ve gone to england  and  i ll send the letter to london to be posted       then that s all settled       can i do anything for  you    he asked      god himself can t do anything for me   she said  biting the edge of  her veil      where are you going now       back to the d harcourt  it s early yet      she stood defiantly smiling at him      what were you doing there  the night you met her   he asked abruptly      what does one do       what s become of de villermay   he asked      gone home  got married       and so you thought        oh  if you want to know what i thought you re welcome  i thought i d  damn myself as deep as i could  to pile up the reckoning for him  and  i ve about done it  good bye  i must be getting on       i ll come a bit of the way with you   he said     at the door he turned  took her hand and kissed it gently and  reverently      that s very sweet of you   she opened astonished eyes at him   i  always used to think you an awful brute       it was very theatrical of me   he told himself later   but it summed  up the situation  sentimental ass you re growing      betty got her letter from england and cried over it and was glad over  it      i have done one thing  anyway   she told herself   one really truly  good thing  i ve saved my poor dear paula  oh  how right i was  how i  knew her            book     the other woman          chapter xv       on mount parnassus     at long barton the reverend cecil had strayed into betty s room  now  no longer boudoir and bedchamber  but just a room  swept  dusted   tidy  with the horrible tidiness of a room that is not used  there  were squares of bright yellow on the dull drab of the wall paper   marking the old hanging places of the photographs and pictures that  betty had taken to paris  he opened the cupboard door  one or two  faded skirts  a flattened garden hat and a pair of betty s old shoes   he shut the door again quickly  as though he had seen betty s ghost     the next time he went to sevenoaks he looked in at the builders and  decorators  gave an order  and chose a wall paper with little pink  roses on it  when betty came home for christmas she should not find  her room the faded desert it was now  he ordered pink curtains to  match the rosebuds  and it was when he got home that he found the  letter that told him she was not to come at christmas     but he did not countermand his order  if not at christmas then at  easter  and whenever it was she should find her room a bower  since  she had been away he had felt more and more the need to express his  affection  he had expressed it  he thought  to the uttermost  by  letting her go at all  and now he wanted to express it in detail  by  pink curtains  satin faced wall paper with pink roses  the paper cost  two shillings a piece  and he gloated over the extravagance and over  his pretty  poetic choice  usually the wall papers at the rectory had  been chosen by betty  and the price limited to sixpence  he would  refrain from buying that fuller s church history  the beautiful brown  folio whose perfect boards and rich yellow paper had lived in his  dreams for the last three weeks  ever since he came upon it in the rag  and bone shop in the little back street in maidstone  when the rosebud  paper and the pink curtains were in their place  the shabby carpet was  an insult to their bright prettiness  the reverend cecil bought an  oriental carpet  of the bright patterned jute variety  and was  relieved to find that it only cost a pound     the leaves were falling in brown dry showers in the rectory garden   the chrysanthemums were nearly over  the dahlias blackened and  blighted by the first frosts  a few pale blooms still clung to the  gaunt hollyhock stems  here and there camomile flowers   medicine  daisies  betty used to call them when she was little  their whiteness  tarnished  showed among bent dry stalks of flowers dead and forgotten   round betty s window the monthly rose bloomed pale and pink amid  disheartened foliage  the damp began to shew on the north walls of the  rooms  a fire in the study now daily  for the sake of the books  one  in the drawing room  weekly  for the sake of the piano and the  furniture  and for betty  in far away paris  a fire of crackling twigs  and long logs in the rusty fire basket  and blue and yellow flames  leaping to lick the royal arms of france on the wrought iron  fire back     the rooms were lonely to betty now that paula was gone  she missed her  inexpressibly  but the loneliness was lighted by a glow of pride  of  triumph  of achievement  her deception of her step father was  justified  she had been the means of saving paula  but for her paula  would not have returned  like the prodigal son  to the father s house   betty pictured her there  subdued  saddened  but inexpressibly happy   warming her cramped heart in the sun of forgiveness and love      thank god  i have done some good in the world   said betty     in the brief interview which vernon took to tell her that paula had  gone to england with her father  betty noticed no change in him  she  had no thought for him then  and in the next weeks  when she had  thoughts for him  she did not see him     she could not but be glad that he was in paris  in the midst of her  new experiences he seemed to her like an old friend  yet his being  there put a different complexion on her act of mutiny  when she  decided to deceive her step father  and to stay on in paris alone  paula had been to be saved  and  he  had been  to her thought  in  vienna  not to be met  now paula was gone  and he was here  in the  night when betty lay wakeful and heard the hours chimed by a convent  bell whose voice was toneless and gray as an autumn sky it seemed to  her that all was wrong  that she had committed a fault that was almost  a crime  that there was nothing now to be done but to confess  to go  home and to expiate  as the prodigal son doubtless did among the  thorny roses of forgiveness  those days in the far country  but always  with the morning light came the remembrance that it was not her  father s house to which she must go to make submission  it was her  step father s  and after all  it was her own life  she had to live it   once that confession and submission made she saw herself enslaved  beyond hope of freedom  meanwhile here was the glad  gay life of  independence  new experiences  new sensations  and her step father was  doubtless glad to be rid of her      it isn t as though anyone wanted me at home   she said   and  everything here is so new and good  and i have quite a few friends  already  and i shall have more  this is what they call seeing life      life as she saw it was good to see  the darker  grimmer side of the  student life was wholly hidden from betty  she saw only a colony of  young artists of all nations  but most of england and america  all  good friends and comrades  working and playing with an equal  enthusiasm  she saw girls treated as equals and friends by the men  students  if money were short it was borrowed from the first friend  one met  and quite usually repaid when the home allowance arrived  a  young man would borrow from a young woman or a young woman from a  young man as freely as school boys from each other  most girls had a  special friend among the boys  betty thought at first that these must  be betrothed lovers  miss voscoe  the american  stared when she put  the question about a pair who had just left the restaurant together  with the announcement that they were off to the musee cluny for the  afternoon      engaged  not that i know of  why should they be   she said in a tone  that convicted betty of a social lapse in the putting of the question   yet she defended herself      well  you know  in england people don t generally go about together  like that unless they re engaged  or relations       yes   said miss voscoe  filling her glass from the little bottle of  weak white wine that costs threepence at garnier s   i ve heard that  is so in your country  your girls always marry the wrong man  don t  they  because he s the first and only one they ve ever had the  privilege of conversing with       not quite always  i hope   said betty good humouredly      now in our country   miss voscoe went on   girls look around so as  they can tell there s more different sorts of boys than there are of  squashes  then when they get married to a husband it s because they  like him  or because they like his dollars  or for some reason that  isn t just that he s the only one they ve ever said five words on end  to       there s something in that   betty owned   but my aunt says men never  want to be friends with girls  they always want        to flirt  may be they do  though i don t think so  our men don t  any  way  but if the girl doesn t want to flirt things won t get very  tangled up       but suppose a man got really fond of you  then he might think you  liked him too  if you were always about with him        do him good to have his eyes opened then  besides  who s always about  with anyone  you have a special friend for a bit  and just walk around  and see the sights   and then change partners and have a turn with  somebody else  it s just like at a dance  nobody thinks you re in love  because you dance three or four times running with one boy      betty reflected as she ate her  noix de veau   it was certainly true  that she had seen changes of partners  milly st  leger  the belle of  the students  quarter  changed her partners every week      you see   the american went on   we re not the  stay at home and mind auntie kind that come here to study  what we  want is to learn to paint and to have a good time in between  don t  you make any mistake  miss desmond  this time in paris is  the  time  of our lives to most of us  it s what we ll have to look back at and  talk about  and suppose every time there was any fun going we had to  send around to the nearest store for a chaperon how much fun would  there be left by the time she toddled in  no  the folks at home who  trust us to work trust us to play  and we have our little heads  screwed on the right way      betty remembered that she had been trusted neither for play nor work   yet  from the home standpoint she had been trustworthy  more  trustworthy than most  she had not asked vernon  her only friend  to  come and see her  and when he had said   when shall i see you again    she had answered   i don t know  thank you very much  good bye       i don t know how  you  were raised   miss voscoe went on   but i  guess it was in the pretty sheltered home life  now i d bet you fell  in love with the first man that said three polite words to you       i m not twenty yet   said betty  with ears and face of scarlet      oh  you mean i m to think nobody s had time to say those three polite  words yet  you come right along to my studio  i ve got a tea on  and  i ll see if i can t introduce my friends to you by threes  so as you  get nine polite words at once  you can t fall in love with three boys  a minute  can you      betty went home and put on her prettiest frock  after all  one was  risking a good deal for this paris life  and one might as well get as  much out of it as one could  and one always had a better time of it  when one was decently dressed  her gown was of dead leaf velvet  with  green undersleeves and touches of dull red and green embroidery at  elbows and collar     miss voscoe s studio was at the top of a hundred and seventeen  polished wooden steps  and as betty neared the top flight the sound of  talking and laughter came down to her  mixed with the rattle of china  and the subdued tinkle of a mandolin  she opened the door  the room  seemed full of people  but she only saw two  one was vernon and the  other was temple     betty furiously resented the blush that hotly covered neck  ears and  face      here you are   cried miss voscoe  she was kind  she gave but one  fleet glance at the blush and  linking her arm in betty s  led her  round the room  betty heard her name and other names  people were  being introduced to her  she heard      pleased to know you         pleased to make your acquaintance         delighted to meet you       and realised that her circle of american acquaintances was widening   when miss voscoe paused with her before the group of which temple and  vernon formed part betty felt as though her face had swelled to that  degree that her eyes must  with the next red wave  start out of her  head  the two hands  held out in successive greeting  gave miss voscoe  the key to betty s flushed entrance     she drew her quickly away  and led her up to a glaring poster where a  young woman in a big red hat sat at a cafe table  and under cover of  betty s purely automatic recognition of the composition s talent   murmured      which of them was it       i beg your pardon   betty mechanically offered the deferent defence      which was it that said the three polite words  before you d ever met  anyone else       ah   said betty   you re so clever        too clever to live  yes   said miss voscoe   but before i die  which  was it       i was going to say   said betty  her face slowly drawing back into  itself its natural colouring   that you re so clever you don t want to  be told things  if you re sure it s one of them  you ought to know  which       well   remarked miss voscoe   i guess mr  temple       didn t i say you were clever   said betty      then it s the other one      before the studio tea was over  vernon and temple both had conveyed to  betty the information that it was the hope of meeting her that had  drawn them to miss voscoe s studio that afternoon      because  after all   said vernon   we  do  know each other better  than either of us knows anyone else in paris  and  if you d let me  i  could put you to a thing or two in the matter of your work  after all   i ve been through the mill       it s very kind of you   said betty   but i m all alone now paula s  gone  and        we ll respect the conventions   said vernon gaily   but the  conventions of the quartier latin aren t the conventions of clapham       no  i know   said she   but there s a point of honour   she paused    there are reasons   she added   why i ought to be more conventional  than clapham  i should like to tell you  some time  only  but i  haven t got anyone to tell anything to  i wonder        what  what do you wonder      betty spoke with effort      i know it sounds insane  but  you know my stepfather thought you  you  wanted to marry me  you didn t ever  did you      vernon was silent  none of his habitual defences served him in this  hour      you see   betty went on   all that sort of thing is such nonsense  if  i knew you cared about someone else everything would be so simple       eliminate love   said vernon   and the world is a simple example in  vulgar fractions       i want it to be simple addition   said betty   lady st  craye is very  beautiful       yes   said vernon      is she in love with you       ask her   said vernon  feeling like a schoolboy in an examination      if she were  and you cared for her  then you and i could be friends   i should like to be real friends with you       let us be friends   said he when he had paused a moment  he made the  proposal with every possible reservation      really   she said   i m so glad      if there was a pang  betty pretended to herself that there was none   if vernon s conscience fluttered him he was able to soothe it  it was  an art that he had studied for years      say  you two      the voice of miss voscoe fell like a pebble into the pool of silence  that was slowly widening between them      say  we re going to start a sketch club for really reliable girls  we  can have it here  and it ll only be one franc an hour for the model   and say six sous each for tea  two afternoons a week  three  five   nine of us  you ll join  miss desmond       yes  oh  yes   said betty  conscientiously delighted with the idea of  more work      that makes  nine six sous and two hours model  how much is that  mr   temple   i see it written on your speaking brow that you took the  mathematical wranglership at oxford college       four francs seventy   said temple through the shout of laughter      have i said something comme il ne faut pas   said miss voscoe      you couldn t   said vernon   every word leaves your lips without a  stain upon its character       won t you let us join   asked an irish student   you ll be lost  entirely without a lord of creation to sharpen your pencils       we mean to  work    said miss voscoe   if you want to work take a box  of matches and a couple of sticks of brimstone and make a little  sketch class of your own       i don t see what you want with models   said a very young and shy boy  student   couldn t you pose for each other  and       a murmur of dissent from the others drove him back into shy silence      no amateur models in this academy   said miss voscoe   oh  we ll make  the time honoured institutions sit up with the work we ll do  let s  all pledge ourselves to send in to the salon  or anyway to the  independants  what we re suffering from in this quarter s  git up and git  why should we be contented to be nobody       on the contrary   said vernon   miss voscoe is everybody  almost       i m the nobody who can t get a word in edgeways anyhow   she said    what i ve been trying to say ever since i was born  pretty near  is  that what this class wants is a competent professor  some bully  top of the tree artist  to come and pull our work all to pieces and  wipe his boots on the bits  mr  vernon  don t you know any one who s  pining to give us free crits       temple is   said vernon   there s no mistaking that longing glance of  his       as a competent professor i make you my bow of gratitude   said  temple   but i should never have the courage to criticise the work of  nine fair ladies       you needn t criticise them all at once   said a large girl from  minneapolis   nor yet all in the gaudy eye of heaven  we ll screen off  a corner for our professor  sort of confessional business  you sit  there and we ll go to you one by one with our sins in our hand        that  would scare him some i surmise   said miss voscoe      not at all   said temple  a little nettled  he hardly knew why      i didn t know you were so brave   said the minneapolis girl      perhaps he didn t want you to know   said miss voscoe   perhaps  that s his life s dark secret       people often pretend to a courage that they haven t   said vernon   a  consistent pose of cowardice  that would be novel and  i see the idea  developing  more than useful       is that  your  pose   asked temple  still rather tartly   because if  it is  i beg to offer you  in the name of these ladies  the chair of  professor behind the screen       i m not afraid of the nine muses   vernon laughed back   as long as  they are nine  it s the light that lies in woman s eyes that i ve  always had such a nervous dread of       it does make you blink  bless it   said the irish student   but not  from nine pairs at once  as you say  it s the light from one pair that  turns your head       mr  vernon isn t weak in the head   said the shy boy suddenly      no   said vernon   it s the heart that s weak with me  i have to be  very careful of it       well  but will you   said a downright girl      will i what  i m sorry  but i ve lost my cue  i think  where were  we  at losing hearts  wasn t it       no   said the downright girl   i didn t mean that  i mean will you  come and criticise our drawings       fiddle   said miss voscoe luminously   mr  vernon s too big for  that       oh  well   said vernon   if you don t think i should be competent       you don t mean to say you would       who wouldn t jump at the chance of playing apollo to the fairest set  of muses in the quartier   said temple   but after all  i had the  refusal of the situation  i won t renounce        bobby  you unman me   interrupted vernon  putting down his cup   you  shall  not  renounce the altruistic pleasure which you promise to  yourself in yielding this professorship to me  i accept it       i m hanged if you do   said temple   you proposed me yourself  and  i m elected  aren t i  miss voscoe       that s so   said she   but mr  vernon s president too       i ve long been struggling with the conviction that temple and i were  as brothers  now i yield  temple  to my arms      they embraced  elegantly  enthusiastically  almost as frenchmen use   and the room applauded the faithful burlesque      what s come to me that i should play the goat like this   vernon  asked himself  as he raised his head from temple s broad shoulder   then he met betty s laughing eyes  and no longer regretted his  assumption of that difficult role      it s settled then  tuesdays and fridays  four to six   he said   at  last i am to be        the light of the harem   said miss voscoe      can there be two lights   asked temple anxiously   if not  consider  the fraternal embrace withdrawn       no  you re  the  light  of course   said betty   mr  vernon s the  ancient light  he s older than you are  isn t he      the roar of appreciation of her little joke surprised betty  and  a  little  pleased her  till miss voscoe whispered under cover of it       ancient  light  then he  was  the three polite word man      betty explained her little jest      all the same   said the other   it wasn t any old blank walls you  were thinking about  i believe he is the one       it s a great thing to be able to believe anything   said betty  and  the talk broke up into duets  she found that temple was speaking to  her      i came here to day because i wanted to meet you  miss desmond   he  was saying   i hope you don t think it s cheek of me to say it  but  there s something about you that reminds me of the country at home       that s a very pretty speech   said betty  he reminded her of the cafe  d harcourt  but she did not say so      you remind me of a garden   he went on   but i don t like to see a  garden without a hedge round it       you think i ought to have a chaperon   said betty bravely   but  chaperons aren t needed in this quarter       i wish i were your brother   said temple      i m so glad you re not   said betty  she wanted no chaperonage  even  fraternal  but the words made him shrink  and then sent a soft warmth  through him  on the whole he was not sorry that he was not her  brother     at parting vernon  at the foot of the staircase  said      and when may i see you again       on tuesday  when the class meets       but i didn t mean when shall i see the class  when shall i see miss  desmond       oh  whenever you like   betty answered gaily   whenever lady st   craye can spare you      he let her say it           chapter xvi        love and tupper       whenever vernon liked  proved to be the very next day  he was waiting  outside the door of the atelier when betty  in charcoal smeared  pinafore  left the afternoon class      won t you dine with me somewhere to night   said he      i am going to garnier s   she said  not even for him  friend of hers  and affianced of another as he might be  would she yet break the rule  of a life paula had instituted      fallen as i am   he answered gaily   i am not yet so low as to be  incapable of dining at garnier s      so when betty passed through the outer room of the restaurant and  along the narrow little passage where eyes and nose attest strongly  the neighborhood of the kitchen  she was attended by a figure that  aroused the spontaneous envy of all her acquaintances  in the inner  room where they dined it was remarked that such a figure would be more  at home at durand s or the cafe de paris than at garnier s  that night  the first breath of criticism assailed betty  to afficher oneself with  a fellow student  a  type   polish or otherwise  that was all very  well  but with an obvious boulevardier  a creature from the other  side  this dashed itself against the conventions of the artistic  quartier  and conventions  even of such quarters  are iron strong      fiddle de dee   said miss voscoe to her companions  shocked comments    they were raised in the same village  or something  he used to give  her peanuts when he was in short jackets  and she used to halve her  candies with him  friend of childhood s hour  that s all  and besides  he s one of the presidents of our sketch club      but all garnier s marked that whereas the habitues contented  themselves with an omelette aux champignons  saute potatoes and a  petit suisse  or the like modest menu  betty s new friend ordered for  himself  and for her   a real regular dinner   beginning with hors  d oeuvre and ending with  mendiants    mendiants  are raisins and  nuts  the nearest to dessert that at this season you could get at  garniers  also he passed over with smiling disrelish the little  carafons of weak wine for which one pays five sous if the wine be red   and six if it be white  he went out and interviewed madame at her  little desk among the flowers and nuts and special sweet dishes  and  it was a bottle of real wine with a real cork to be drawn that adorned  the table between him and betty  to her the whole thing was of the  nature of a festival  she enjoyed the little sensation created by her  companion  and the knowledge which she thought she had of his  relations to lady st  craye absolved her of any fear that in dining  with him tete a tete she was doing anything  not quite nice   to her  the thought of his engagement was as good or as bad as a chaperon  for  betty s innocence was deeply laid  and had survived the shock of all  the waves that had beaten against it since her coming to paris  it was  more than innocence  it was a very honest  straightforward childish  naivete      it s almost the same as if he was married   she said   there can t be  any harm in having dinner with a man who s married  or almost  married      so she enjoyed herself  vernon exerted himself to amuse her  but he  was surprised to find that he was not so happy as he had expected to  be  it was good that betty had permitted him to dine with her alone   but it was flat  after dinner he took her to the odeon  and she said  good night to him with a lighter heart than she had known since paula  left her     in these rooms now sometimes it was hard to keep one s eyes shut  and  to keep her eyes shut was now betty s aim in life  even more than the  art for which she pretended to herself that she lived  for now that  paula had gone the deception of her father would have seemed less  justifiable  had she ever allowed herself to face the thought of it  for more than a moment  but she used to fly the thought and go round  to one of the girls  rooms to talk about art with a big a  and forget  how little she liked or admired betty desmond     she was now one of a circle of english  american and german students   the sketch club had brought her eight new friends  and they went about  in parties by twos and threes  or even sevens and eights  and betty  went with them  enjoying the fun of it all  which she liked  and  missing all that she would not have liked if she had seen it  but  vernon was the only man with whom she dined tete a tete or went to the  theatre alone     to him the winter passed in a maze of doubt and self contempt  he  could not take what the gods held out  could not draw from his  constant companionship of betty the pleasure which his artistic  principles  his trained instincts taught him to expect  he had now all  the tete a tetes he cared to ask for  and he hated that it should be  so  he almost wanted her to be in a position where such things should  be impossible to her  he wanted her to be guarded  watched  sheltered   and he had never wanted that for any woman in his life before      i shall be wishing her in a convent next   he said   with high walls  with spikes on the top  then i should walk round and round the outside  of the walls and wish her out  but i should not be able to get at her   and nothing else would either      lady st  craye was more charming than ever  vernon knew it and  sometimes he deliberately tried to let her charm him  but though he  perceived her charm he could not feel it  always before he had felt  what he chose to feel  or perhaps  he hated the thought and would not  look at it  perhaps all his love affairs had been just pictures   perhaps he had never felt anything but an artistic pleasure in their  grouping and lighting  perhaps now he was really feeling natural human  emotion  didn t they call it  but that was just it  he wasn t  what he  felt was resentment  dissatisfaction  a growing inability to control  events or to prearrange his sensations  he felt that he himself was  controlled  he felt like a wild creature caught in a trap  the trap  was not gilded  and he was very uncomfortable in it  even the affairs  of others almost ceased to amuse him  he could hardly call up a  cynical smile at lady st  craye s evident misapprehension of those  conscientious efforts of his to be charmed by her  he was only moved  to a very faint amusement when one day bobbie temple  smoking in the  studio  broke a long silence abruptly to say      look here  someone was saying the other day that a man can be in love  with two women at a time  do you think it s true       two  yes  or twenty       then it s not love   said temple wisely      they call it love   said vernon    i  don t know what they mean by  it  what do  you  mean       by love       yes       i don t exactly know   said temple slowly   i suppose it s wanting to  be with a person  and thinking about nothing else  and thinking  they re the most beautiful and all that  and going over everything  that they ve ever said to you  and wanting        wanting       well  i suppose if it s really love you want to marry them       you can t marry  them   you know   said vernon   at least not  simultaneously  that s just it  well       well that s all  if that s not love  what is       i m hanged if  i  know   said vernon      i thought you knew all about those sort of things       so did i   said vernon to himself  aloud he said      if you want a philosophic definition  it s passion transfigured by  tenderness  at least i ve often said so       but can you feel that for two people at once       or   said vernon  getting interested in his words   it s tenderness  intoxicated by passion  and not knowing that it s drunk        but can you feel that for two        oh  bother   said vernon   every sort of fool fancy calls itself  love  there s the pleasure of pursuit  there s vanity  there s the  satisfaction of your own amour propre  there s desire  there s  intellectual attraction  there s the love of beauty  there s the  artist s joy in doing what you know you can do well  and getting a  pretty woman for sole audience  you might feel one or two or twenty of  these things for one woman  and one or two or twenty different ones  for another  but if you mean do you love two women in the same way  i  say no  thank heaven it s new every time       it mayn t be the same way   said temple   but it s the same thing to  you  if you feel you can t bear to give either of them up       well  then  you can marry one and keep on with the other  or be   friends  with both and marry neither  or cut the whole show and go to  the colonies       then you have to choose between being unhappy or being a blackguard       my good chap  that s the situation in which our emotions are always  landing us  our confounded emotions and the conventions of society       and how are you to know whether the thing s love  or  all those other  things       you don t know  you can t know till it s too late for your knowing to  matter  marriage is like spinach  you can t tell that you hate it till  you ve tried it  only        well       i think i ve heard it said   vernon voiced his own sudden conviction   very carelessly   that love wants to give and passion wants to take   love wants to possess the beloved object  and to make her happy   desire wants possession too  but the happiness is to be for oneself   and if there s not enough happiness for both so much the worse  if i m  talking like a sunday school book you ve brought it on yourself       i like it   said temple      well  since the dissenting surplice has fallen on me  i ll give you a  test  i believe that the more you love a woman the less your thoughts  will dwell on the physical side of the business  you want to take care  of her       yes   said temple      and then often   vernon went on  surprised to find that he wanted to  help the other in his soul searchings   if a chap s not had much to do  with women  the women of our class  i mean  he gets a bit dazed with  them  they re all so nice  confound them  if a man felt he was falling  in love with two women at once  and he had the tiresome temperament  that takes these things seriously  it wouldn t be a bad thing for him  to go away into the country  and moon about for a few weeks  and see  which was the one that bothered his brain most  then he d know where  he was  and not be led like a lamb to the slaughter by the wrong one   they can t both get him  you know  unless his intentions are strictly  dishonourable       i wasn t putting the case that either of them wished to get him    said temple carefully     vernon nodded      of course not  the thing simplifies itself wonderfully if neither of  them wants to get him  even if they both do  matters are less  complicated  it s when only one of them wants him that it s the very  devil for a man not to be sure what  he  wants  that s very clumsily  put  what i mean is        i see what you mean   said temple impatiently        it s the devil for him because then he lets himself drift and the  one who wants him collars him and then of course she always turns out  to be the one he didn t want  my observations are as full of wants as  an advertisement column  but the thing to do in all relations of life  is to make up your mind what it is that you  do  want  and then to  jolly well see that you get it  what i want is a pipe      he filled and lighted one      you talk   said temple slowly   as though a man could get anyone  i  mean anything  he wanted       so he can  my dear chap  if he only wants her badly enough       badly enough       badly enough to make the supreme sacrifice to get her          temple enquired      marriage   vernon answered   there s only one excuse for marriage       excuse       excuse  and that excuse is that one couldn t help it  the only excuse  one will have to offer  some day  to the recording angel  for all  one s other faults and follies  a man who  can  help getting married   and doesn t  deserves all he gets       i don t agree with you in the least   said temple    about marriage  i  mean  a man  ought  to want to get married        to anybody  without its being anybody in particular       yes   said temple stoutly   if he gets to thirty without wanting to  marry any one in particular  he ought to look about till he finds some  one he does want  it s the right and proper thing to marry and have  kiddies       oh  if you re going to be patriarchal   said vernon   what a symbolic  dialogue  we begin with love and we end with marriage  there s the  tragedy of romance  in a nut shell  yes  life s a beastly rotten show   and the light won t last more than another two hours       illustration   unfinished  but a disquieting likeness       your hints are always as delicate as gossamer   said temple   don t  throw anything at me  i m going      he went  leaving his secret in vernon s hands      poor old temple  that s the worst of walking carefully all your days   you do come such an awful cropper when you do come one  two women  the  jasmine lady must have been practising on his poor little heart   heigh ho  i wish she could do as much for me  and the other one    her   i suppose      the use of the pronoun  the disuse of the grammar pulled him up short      by jove   he said   that s what people say when  but i m not in  love  with anybody  i want to work      but he didn t work  he seldom did now  and when he did the work was  not good  his easel held most often the portrait of betty that had  been begun at long barton  unfinished  but a disquieting likeness  he  walked up and down his room not thinking  but dreaming  his dreams  took him to the warren  in the pure morning light  he saw betty  he  told himself what he had said  what she had said      and it was i who advised her to come to paris  if only i d known  then       he stopped and asked himself what he knew now that he had not known  then  refused himself the answer  and went to call on lady st  craye     christmas came and went  the black winds of january swept the  boulevards  and snow lay white on the walls of court and garden   betty s life was full now     the empty cage that had opened its door to love at long barton had now  other occupants  ambition was beginning to grow its wing feathers  she  could draw  at least some day she would be able to draw  already she  had won a prize with a charcoal study of a bare back  but she did not  dare to name this to her father  and when he wrote to ask what was the  subject of her prize drawing she replied with misleading truth that it  was a study from nature  his imagination pictured a rustic cottage  a  water wheel  a castle and mountains in the distance and cows and a  peasant in the foreground     but though her life was now crowded with new interests that  first comer was not ousted  only he had changed his plumage and she  called him friendship  she blushed sometimes and stamped her foot when  she remembered those meetings in the summer mornings  her tremors  her  heart beats  and oh  the  drivel  she had written in her diary      girls ought never to be allowed to lead that  sheltered home life     she said to miss voscoe   with nothing real in it  it makes your mind  all swept and garnished and then you hurry to fill it up with  rubbish       that s so   said her friend      if ever  i  have a daughter   said betty   she shall set to work at   something  definite the very instant she leaves school  if it s only  hebrew or algebra  not just parish duties that she didn t begin  and  doesn t want to go on with  but something that s her  own  work       you re beginning to see straight  i surmised you would by and by  but  don t you go to the other end of the see saw  miss daisy face       what do you mean   asked betty  it was the morning interval when  students eat patisserie out of folded papers  the two were on the  window ledge of the atelier  looking down on the convent garden where  already the buds were breaking to green leaf      why  there s room for the devil even if your flat ain t swept and  garnished  he folds up mighty small  and gets into less space than a  poppy seed       what do you mean   asked betty again      i mean that vernon chap   said miss voscoe down rightly   i told you  to change partners every now and then  but with you it s that vernon  this week and last week and the week after next       i ve known him longer than i have the others  and i like him   said  betty      oh  he s all right  fine and dandy   replied miss voscoe   he s a big  man  too  in his own line  not the kind you expect to see knocking  about at a students  cremerie  does he give you lessons       he did at home   said betty      take care he doesn t teach you what s the easiest thing in creation  to learn about a man       what s that   betty did not like to have to ask the question      why  how not to be able to do without him  of course   said miss  voscoe      you re quite mistaken   said betty eagerly   one of the reasons i  don t mind going about with him so much is that he s engaged to be  married       acquainted with the lady       yes   said betty  sheltering behind the convention that an  introduction at a tea party constitutes acquaintanceship  she was glad  miss voscoe had not asked her if she  knew  lady st  craye      oh  well   miss voscoe jumped up and shook the flakes of pastry off  her pinafore   if she doesn t mind  i guess i ve got no call to  but  why don t you give that saint in the go to hell collar a turn       meaning       mr  temple  he admires you no end  he d be always in your pocket if  you d let him  he s worth fifty of the other man  as  a man  if he  isn t as an artist  i keep my eyes skinned  and the sketch club gives  me a chance to tot them both up  i guess i can size up a man some  the  other man isn t  fast   that s how it strikes me       fast   echoed betty  bewildered      fast dye  fast colour  i suspicion he d go wrong a bit in the wash   temple s fast colour  warranted not to run       i know   said betty   but i don t care for the colour  and i m rather  tired of the pattern       i wish you d tell me which of the two was the three polite word man       i know you do  but surely you see  now        you re too cute  just as likely it s the temple one  and that s why  you re so sick of the pattern by now       didn t i tell you you were clever   laughed betty     but  all the same  next evening when vernon called to take her to  dinner  she said      couldn t we go somewhere else  i m tired of garnier s      vernon was tired of garnier s  too      do you know thirion s   he said   thirion s in the boulevard st   germain  thirion s where du maurier used to go  and thackeray  and all  sorts of celebrated people  and where the host treats you like a  friend  and the waiter like a brother       i should love to be treated like a waiter s brother  do let s go    said betty      he s a dream of a waiter   vernon went on as they turned down the  lighted slope of the rue de rennes   has a voice like a trumpet  and  takes a pride in calling twenty orders down the speaking tube in one  breath  ending up with a shout  he never makes a mistake either  shall  we walk  or take the tram  or a carriage      the fate who was amusing herself by playing with betty s destiny had  sent temple to call on lady st  craye that afternoon  and lady st   craye had seemed bored  so bored that she had hardly appeared to  listen to temple s talk  which  duly directed by her quite early into  the channel she desired for it  flowed in a constant stream over the  name  the history  the work  the personality of vernon  when at last  the stream ebbed lady st  craye made a pretty feint of stifling a  yawn      oh  how horrid i am   she cried with instant penitence   and how very  rude you will think me  i think i have the blues to day  or  to be  more french and more poetic  the black butterflies  it  is  so sweet  of you to have let me talk to you  i know i ve been as stupid as an  owl  won t you stay and dine with me  i ll promise to cheer up if you  will      mr  temple would  more than gladly      or no   lady st  craye went on   that ll be dull for you  and perhaps  even for me if i begin to think i m boring you  couldn t we do  something desperate  dine at a latin quarter restaurant for instance   what was that place you were telling me of  where the waiter has a  wonderful voice and makes the orders he shouts down the tube sound  like the recitative of the basso at the opera       thirion s   said temple   but it wasn t i  it was vernon       thirion s  that s it   lady st  craye broke in before vernon s name  left his lips   would you like to take me there to dine  mr  temple      it appeared that mr  temple would like it of all things      then i ll go and put on my hat   said she and trailed her sea green  tea gown across the room  at the door she turned to say   it will be  fun  won t it    and to laugh delightedly  like a child who is  promised a treat     that was how it happened that lady st  craye  brushing her dark furs  against the wall of thirion s staircase  came  followed by temple   into the room where betty and vernon  their heads rather close  together  were discussing the menu     this was what lady st  craye had thought of more than a little  yet it  was not what she had expected  vernon  perhaps  yes  or the girl  but  not vernon and the girl together  not now  at her very first visit  it  was not for a second that she hesitated  temple had not even had time  to see who it was to whom she spoke before she had walked over to the  two  and greeted them      how perfectly delightful   she said   miss desmond  i ve been meaning  to call on you  but it s been so cold  and i ve been so cross  i ve  called on nobody  ah  mr  vernon  you too      she looked at the vacant chair near his  and vernon had to say      you ll join us  of course      so the two little parties made one party  and one of the party was  angry and annoyed  and no one of the party was quite pleased  and all  four concealed what they felt  and affected what they did not feel   with as much of the tact of the truly well bred as each could call up   in this polite exercise lady st  craye was easily first     she was charming to temple  she was very nice to betty  and she spoke  to vernon with a delicate  subtle  faint suggestion of proprietorship  in her tone  at least that was how it seemed to betty  to temple it  seemed that she was tacitly apologising to an old friend for having  involuntarily broken up a dinner a deux  to vernon her tone seemed to  spell out an all but overmastering jealousy proudly overmastered  all  that pretty fiction of there being now no possibility of sentiment  between him and her flickered down and died  and with it the interest  that he had felt in her    she  have unexplored reserves  bah   he  told himself   she is just like the rest   he felt that she had not  come from the other side of the river just to dine with temple  he  knew she had been looking for him  and the temptation assailed him to  reward her tender anxiety by devoting himself wholly to betty  then he  remembered what he had let betty believe  as to the relations in which  he stood to this other woman     his face lighted up with a smile of answering tenderness  without  neglecting betty he seemed to lay the real homage of his heart at the  feet of that heart s lady      by jove   he thought  as the dark  beautiful eyes met his in a look  of more tenderness than he had seen in them this many a day   if only  she knew how she s playing my game for me      betty  for her part  refused to recognise a little pain that gnawed at  her heart and stole all taste from the best dishes of thirion s  she  talked as much as possible to temple  because it was the proper thing  to do  she told herself  and she talked very badly  lady st  craye was  transfigured by vernon s unexpected acceptance of her delicate  advances  intoxicated by the sudden flutter of a dream she had only  known with wings in full flight  into the region where dreams  clasped  to the heart  become realities  she grew momently more beautiful  the  host  going from table to table  talking easily to his guests  could  not keep his fascinated eyes from her face  the proprietor of  thirion s had good taste  and knew a beautiful woman when he saw her     betty s eyes  too  strayed more and more often from her plate  and  from temple to the efflorescence of this new beauty light  she felt  mean and poor  ill dressed  shabby  dowdy  dull  weary and  uninteresting  her face felt tired  it was an effort to smile     when the dinner was over she said abruptly      if you ll excuse me  i ve got a dreadful headache  no  i don t want  anyone to see me home  just put me in a carriage      she insisted  and it was done     when the carriage drew up in front of the closed porte cochere of     boulevard montparnasse  betty was surprised and wounded to discover  that she was crying      well  you  knew  they were engaged   she said as she let herself into  her room with her latchkey   you knew they were engaged  what did you  expect      temple could not remember afterwards exactly how he got separated from  the others  it just happened  as such unimportant things will  he  missed them somehow  at a crossing  looked about him in vain  shrugged  his shoulders and went home     lady st  craye hesitated a moment with her latchkey in her hand  then  she threw open the door of her flat      come in  won t you   she said  and led the way into her fire warm   flower scented  lamplit room  vernon also hesitated a moment  then he  followed  he stood on the hearth rug with his back to the wood fire   he did not speak     somehow it was difficult for her to take up their talk at the place  and in the strain where it had broken off when betty proclaimed her  headache     yet this was what she must do  it seemed to her  or lose all the  ground she had gained      you ve been very charming to me this evening   she said at last  and  knew as she said it that it was the wrong thing to say      you flatter me   said vernon      i was so surprised to see you there   she went on     vernon was surprised that she should say it  he had thought more  highly of her powers      the pleasure was mine   he said in his most banal tones   the  surprise  alas  was all for you  and all you gained       weren t  you  surprised    lady st  craye was angry and humiliated   that she  she  should find herself nervous  at fault  find herself  playing the game as crudely as any shopgirl      no   said vernon      but you couldn t have expected me   she knew quite well what she was  doing  but she was too nervous to stop herself      i ve always expected you   he said deliberately   ever since i told  you that i often dined at thirion s       you expected me to        to run after me   said vernon with paraded ingenuousness   yes   didn t you        i  run after  you   you    she stopped short  for she saw in his  eyes that  if she let him quarrel with her now  it was forever     he at the same moment awoke from the trance of anger that had come  upon him when he found himself alone with her  anger at her  and at  himself  fanned to fury by the thought of betty and of what she  at  this moment  must be thinking  he laughed      ah  don t break my heart   he said   i ve been so happy all the  evening fancying that you had  you had        had what   she asked with dry lips  for the caress in his tone was  such as to deceive the very elect      had felt just the faintest little touch of interest in me  had cared  to know how i spent my evenings  and with whom       you thought i could stoop to spy on you   she asked   monsieur  flatters himself      the anger in him was raising its head again      monsieur very seldom does   he said     she took that as she chose to take it      no  you re beautifully humble       and you re proudly beautiful      she flushed and looked down      don t you like to be told that you re beautiful       not by you  not like that       and so you didn t come to thirion s to see me  how one may deceive  oneself  the highest hopes we cherish here  another beautiful illusion  gone      she said to herself   i can do nothing with him in this mood   and  aloud she could not help saying   was it a beautiful one       very   he answered gaily   can you doubt it      she found nothing to say  and even as she fought for words she  suddenly found that he had caught her in his arms  and kissed her  and  that the sound of the door that had banged behind him was echoing in  her ears     she put her hands to her head  she could not see clearly           chapter xvii       interventions     that kiss gave lady st  craye furiously to think  as they say in  france     had it meant    what had it meant  was it the crown of her hopes  her  dreams  was it possible that now  at last  after all that had gone  before  she might win him  had won him  even     the sex instinct said  no      then  if  no  were the answer to that question  the kiss had been mere  brutality  it had meant just      you chose to follow me  to play the spy  what the deuce do you want   is it this  god knows you re welcome   the kiss following     the kiss stung  it was not the first  but the others  even the last of  them  two years before  had not had that sting     lady st  craye  biting her lips in lonely dissection of herself and of  him  dared take no comfort  also  she no longer dared to follow him   to watch him  to spy on him     in her jasmine scented leisure lady st  craye analysed herself  and  him and her  above all her  who was betty  to find out how it all  seemed to her  that  presently  seemed to lady st  craye the one  possible  the one important thing  so after she had given a few days  to the analysis of that kiss  had failed to reach certainty as to its  elements  had writhed in her failure  and bitterly resented the  mysteries constituent that falsified all her calculations  she dressed  herself beautifully  and went to call on the constituent  betty     betty was at home  she was drawing at a table  cunningly placed at  right angles to the window  she rose with a grace that lady st  craye  had not seen in her  she was dressed in a plain gown  that hung from  the shoulders in long  straight  green folds  her hair was down   and  betty had beautiful hair  lady st  craye s hair had never been long   betty s fell nearly to her knees      oh  was the door open   she said   i didn t know  i ve  i m so  sorry  i ve been washing my hair       it s lovely   said the other woman  with an appreciation quite  genuine   what a pity you can t always wear it like that       it s long   said betty disparagingly   but the colour s horrid  what  miss voscoe calls boy colour       boy colour       oh  just nothing in particular  mousy       if you had golden hair  or black  miss desmond  you d have a quite  unfair advantage over the rest of us       i don t think so   said betty very simply   you see  no one ever sees  it down       what a charming place you ve got here   lady st  craye went on      yes   said betty   it is nice   and she thought of paula      and do you live here all alone       yes  i had a friend with me at first  but she s gone back to  england       don t you find it very dull       oh  no  i know lots of people now       and they come to see you here      lady st  craye had decided that it was not necessary to go delicately   the girl was evidently stupid  and one need not pick one s words      yes   said betty      mr  vernon s a great friend of yours  isn t he       yes       i suppose you see a great deal of him       yes  is there anything else you would like to know      the scratch was so sudden  so fierce  so feline that for a moment lady  st  craye could only look blankly at her hostess  then she recovered  herself enough to say      oh  i m so sorry  was i asking a lot of questions  it s a dreadful  habit of mine  i m afraid  when i m interested in people      betty scratched again quite calmly and quite mercilessly      it s quite natural that mr  vernon should interest you  but i don t  think i m likely to be able to tell you anything about him that you  don t know  may i get you some tea      it was impossible for lady st  craye to reply   i meant that i was  interested in  you   not in mr  vernon   so she said      thank you  that will be delightful      betty went along the little passage to her kitchen  and her visitor  was left to revise her impressions     when betty came back with the tea tray  her hair was twisted up  the  kettle could be heard hissing in the tiny kitchen      can t i help you   lady st  craye asked  leaning back indolently in  the most comfortable chair      no  thank you  it s all done now       illustration    no  thank you it s all done now       betty poured the tea for the other woman to drink  her own remained  untasted  she exerted herself to manufacture small talk  was very  amiable  very attentive  lady st  craye almost thought she must have  dreamed those two sharp cat scratches at the beginning of the  interview  but presently betty s polite remarks came less readily   there were longer intervals of silence  and lady st  craye for once  was at a loss  her nerve was gone  she dared not tempt the claws  again  after the longest pause of all betty said suddenly      i think i know why you came to day       i came to see you  because you re a friend of mr  vernon s       you came to see me because you wanted to find out exactly how much  i m a friend of mr  vernon s  didn t you      candour is the most disconcerting of the virtues      not in the least   lady st  craye found herself saying   i came to  see you  because  as i said       i don t think it is much use your coming to see me   betty went on    though  if you meant it kindly  but you didn t  you didn t  if you  had it wouldn t have made any difference  we should never get on with  each other  never       really  miss desmond   lady st  craye clutched her card case and half  rose   i begin to think we never should      betty s ignorance of the usages of good society stood her friend  she  ignored  not consciously  but by the prompting of nature  the social  law which decrees that one should not speak of things that really  interest one      do sit down   she said   i m glad you came  because i know exactly  what you mean  now       if the knowledge were only mutual   sighed lady st  craye  and found  courage to raise eyebrows wearily      you don t like my going about with mr  vernon  well  you ve only to  say so  only when you re married you ll find you ve got your work cut  out to keep him from having any friends except you      lady st  craye had the best of reasons for believing this likely to be  the truth  she said      when i m married       yes   said betty firmly   you re jealous  you ve no cause to be  and  i tell you that because i think being jealous must hurt  but it would  have been nicer of you  if you d come straight to me and said   look  here  i don t like you going about with the man i m engaged to   i  should have understood then and respected you  but to come like a  child s guide to knowledge       the other woman was not listening   engaged to him    the words sang  deliciously  disquietingly in her ears      but who said i was engaged to him       he did  of course  he isn t ashamed of it  if you are       he told you that       yes  now aren t you ashamed of yourself      country bred betty  braced by the straightforward directness of miss  voscoe  and full of the nervous energy engendered by a half understood  trouble  had routed  for a moment  the woman of the world  but only  for a moment  then lady st  craye  unable to estimate the gain or loss  of the encounter  pulled herself together to make good her retreat      yes   she said  with her charming smile   i am ashamed of myself  i   was  jealous  i own it  but i shouldn t have shown it as i did if i d  known the sort of girl you are  come  forgive me  can t you  understand  and forgive       it was all my fault   the generosity of betty hastened to meet what  it took to be the generosity of the other   forgive me  i won t see  him again at all  if you don t want me to       no  no   even at that moment  in one illuminating flash  lady st   craye saw the explications that must follow the announcement of that  renunciatory decision   no  no  if you do that i shall feel sure that  you don t forgive me for being so silly  just let everything go  on  won t you  and please  please don t tell him anything about  about  to day       how could i   asked betty      but promise you won t  you know  men are so vain  i should hate him  to know   she hesitated and then finished the sentence with fine  art   to know  how much i care       of course you care   said betty downrightly   you ought to care  it  would be horrid of you if you didn t       but i don t   now   now i  know  you  miss desmond  i understand so  well  and i like to think of his being with you      even to betty s ears this did not ring quite true      you like     she said      i mean i quite understand now  i thought  i don t know what i  thought  you re so pretty  you know  and he has had so very  many  love affairs       he hasn t one with me   said betty briefly      ah  you re still angry  and no wonder  do forgive me  miss desmond   and let s be friends      betty s look as she gave her hand was doubtful  but the hand was  given      and you ll keep my poor little secret       i should have thought you would have been proud for him to know how  much you care       ah  my dear   lady st  craye became natural for an instant under the  transfiguring influence of her real thoughts as she spoke them   my  dear  don t believe it  when a man s sure of you he doesn t care any  more  it s while he s not quite sure that he cares       i don t think that s so always   said betty      ah  believe me  there are  more ways of killing a cat than choking it  with butter   forgive the homely aphorism  when you have a lover of  your own  or perhaps you have now       perhaps i have   betty stood on guard with a steady face      well  when you have  or if you have  remember never to let him be  quite sure  it s the only way      the two parted  with a mutually kindly feeling that surprised one as  much as the other  lady st  craye drove home contrasting bitterly the  excellence of her maxims with the ineptitude of her practice  she had  let him know that she cared  and he had left her  that was two years  ago  and  now that she had met him again  when she might have played  the part she had recommended to that chit with the long hair  the part  she knew to be the wise one  she had once more suffered passion to  overcome wisdom  and had shown him that she loved him  and he had  kissed her     she blushed in the dusk of her carriage for the shame of that kiss     but he had told that girl that he was engaged to her     a delicious other flush replaced the blush of shame  why should he  have done that unless he really meant    in that case the kiss was  nothing to blush about  and yet it was  she knew it     she had time to think in the days that followed  days that brought  temple more than once to her doors  but vernon never     betty left alone let down her damp hair and tried to resume her  drawing  but it would not do  the emotion of the interview was too  recent  her heart was beating still with anger  and resentment  and  other feelings less easily named     vernon was to come to fetch her at seven  she would not face him  let  him go and dine with the woman he belonged to     betty went out at half past six  she would not go to garnier s  nor to  thirion s  that was where he would look for her     she walked steadily on  down the boulevard  she would dine at some  place she had never been to before  a sickening vision of that first  night in paris swam before her  she saw again the cafe d harcourt   heard the voices of the women who had spoken to paula  saw the eyes of  the men who had been the companions of those women  in that rout the  face of temple shone  clear cut  severe  she remembered the instant  resentment that had thrilled her at his protective attitude   remembered it and wondered at it a little  she would not have felt  that now  she knew her paris better than she had done then     and with the thought  the face of temple came towards her out of the  crowd  he raised his hat in response to her frigid bow  and had almost  passed her  when she spoke on an impulse that surprised herself      oh  mr  temple      he stopped and turned      i was looking for a place to dine  i m tired of garnier s and  thirion s      he hesitated  and he  too  remembered the night at the cafe  d harcourt  when she had disdained his advice and gone back to take  the advice of paula     he caught himself assuring himself that a man need not be ashamed to  risk being snubbed  making a fool of himself even  if he could do any  good  so he said   you know i have horrid old fashioned ideas about  women   and stopped short      don t you know of any good quiet place near here   said betty      i think women ought to be taken care of  but some of them  miss  desmond  i m so afraid of you  i m afraid of boring you       remorse stirred her      you ve always been most awfully kind   she said warmly   i ve often  wanted to tell you that i m sorry about that first time i saw you  i m  not sorry for what i  did    she added in haste   i can never be  anything but glad for that  but i m sorry i seemed ungrateful to you       now you give me courage   he said   i do know a quiet little place  quite near here  and  as you haven t any of your friends with you   won t you take pity on me and let me dine with you       you re sure you re not giving up some nice engagement  just to  to be  kind to me   she asked  and the forlornness of her tone made him  almost forget that he had half promised to join a party of lady st   craye s      i should like to come with you  i should like it of all things   he  said  and he said it convincingly     they dined together  and the dinner was unexpectedly pleasant to both  of them  they talked of england  of wood  field and meadow  and betty  found herself talking to him of the garden at home and of the things  that grew there  as she had talked to paula  and as she had never  talked to vernon      it s so lovely all the year   she said   when the last mignonette s  over  there are the chrysanthemums  and then the christmas roses  and  ever so early in january the winter aconite and the snow drops  and  the violets under the south wall  and then the little green daffodil  leaves come up and the buds  though it s weeks before they turn into  flowers  and if it s a mild winter the primroses  just little baby  ones  seem to go on all the time       yes   he said   i know  and the wallflowers  they re green all the  time   and the monthly roses  they flower at christmas  and then when  the real roses begin to bud  and when june comes  and you re drunk  with the scent of red roses  the kind you always long for at  christmas       oh  yes   said betty   do you feel like that too  and if you get  them  they re soft limp stalked things  like caterpillars half  disguised as roses by some incompetent fairy  not like the stiff solid  heavy velvet roses with thick green leaves and heaps of thorns  those  are the roses one longs for       yes   he said   those are the roses one longs for   and an odd pause  punctuated the sentence     but the pause did not last  there was so much to talk of  now that  barrier of resentment  wattled with remorse  was broken down  it was  an odd revelation to each  the love of the other for certain authors   certain pictures  certain symphonies  certain dramas  the discovery of  this sort of community of tastes is like the meeting in far foreign  countries of a man who speaks the tongue of one s mother land  the two  lingered long over their coffee  and the  grand marnier  which their  liking for  the garden of lies  led to their ordering  betty had  forgotten vernon  forgotten lady st  craye  in the delightful  interchange of      oh  i do like        and don t you like         and isn t that splendid      these simple sentences  interchanged  took on the value of intimate  confidences      i ve had such a jolly time   temple said   i haven t had such a talk  for ages      and yet all the talk had been mere confessions of faith  in ibsen  in  browning  in maeterlinck  in english gardens  in art for art s sake   and in whistler and beethoven      i ve liked it too   said betty      and it s awfully jolly   he went on   to feel that you ve forgiven  me   the speech suddenly became difficult    at least i mean to say     he ended lamely      it s i who ought to be forgiven   said betty   i m very glad i met  you  i ve enjoyed our talk ever so much      vernon spent an empty evening  and waylaid betty as she left her class  next day      i m sorry   she said   i couldn t help it  i suddenly felt i wanted  something different  so i dined at a new place       alone   said vernon      no   said betty with her chin in the air     vernon digested  as best he might  his first mouthful of  jealousy  real downright sickening jealousy  the sensation astonished  him so much that he lacked the courage to dissect it      will you dine with me to night   was all he found to say      with pleasure   said betty  but it was not with pleasure that she  dined  there was something between her and vernon  both felt it  and  both attributed it to the same cause     the three dinners that followed in the next fortnight brought none of  that old lighthearted companionship which had been the gayest of  table decorations  something was gone  lost  as though a royal rose  had suddenly faded  a rainbow coloured bubble had broken      i m glad   said betty   if he s engaged  i don t want to feel happy  with him      she did not feel happy without him  the inward monitor grew more and  more insistent  she caught herself wondering how temple  with the  serious face and the honest eyes  would regard the lies  the  trickeries  the whole tissue of deceit that had won her her chance of  following her own art  of living her own life     vernon understood  presently  that not even that evening at thirion s  could give the key to this uncomforting change  he had not seen lady  st  craye since the night of the kiss     it was after the fourth flat dinner with betty that he said good night  to her early and abruptly  and drove to lady st  craye s     she was alone  she rose to greet him  and he saw that her eyes were  dark rimmed  and her lips rough      this is very nice of you   she said   it s nearly a month since i saw  you       yes   he said   i know it is  do you remember the last time  hasn t  that taught you not to play with me      the kiss was explained now  lady st  craye shivered      i don t know what you mean   she said  feebly      oh  yes  you do  you re much too clever not to understand  come to  think of it  you re much too everything  too clever  too beautiful   too charming  too everything       you overwhelm me   she made herself say      not at all  you know your points  what i want to know is just one  thing  and that s the thing you re going to tell me      she drew her dry lips inward to moisten them      what do you want to know  why do you speak to me like that  what have  i done       that s what you re going to tell me       i shall tell you nothing  while you ask in that tone       won t you  how can i persuade you   his tone caressed and stung    what arguments can i use  must i kiss you again      she drew herself up  called wildly on all her powers to resent the  insult  nothing came at her call      what do you want me to tell you   she asked  and her eyes implored  the mercy she would not consciously have asked     he saw  and he came a little nearer to her  looking down at her  upturned face with eyes before which her own fell      you don t want another kiss   he said   then tell me what you ve been  saying to miss desmond            chapter xviii       the truth     there was a silence      come  my pretty jasmine lady  speak the truth       i will  what a brute you are       so another lady told me a few months ago  come  tell me       why should i tell you anything   she tried to touch her tone with  scorn      because i choose  you thought you could play with me and fool me and  trick me out of what i mean to have        what you mean to have       yes  what i mean to have  i mean to marry miss desmond  if she ll  have me        you   mean to marry  saul is among the prophets with a vengeance    the scorn came naturally to her voice now     vernon stood as if turned to stone  nothing had ever astonished him so  much as those four words  spoken in his own voice   i mean to marry    he repeated them   i mean to marry miss desmond  if she ll have me   and it s your doing       of course   she shrugged her shoulders   naturally it would be  won t  you sit down  you look so uncomfortable  those french tragedy scenes  with the hero hat in one hand and gloves in the other always seem to  me so comic      that was her score  the first  he put down the hat and gloves and came  towards her  and as he came he hastily sketched his plan of action   when he reached her it was ready formed  his anger was always short  lived  it had died down and left him competent as ever to handle the  scene     he took her hands  pushed her gently into a chair near the table  and  sat down beside her with his elbows on the table and his head in his  hands      forgive me  dear   he said   i was a brute  forgive me  and help me   no one can help me but you      it was a master stroke  and he had staked a good deal on it  the stake  was not lost  she found no words      my dear  sweet jasmine lady   he said   let me talk to you  let me  tell you everything  i can talk to you as i can talk to no one else   because i know you re fond of me  you are fond of me  a little  aren t  you  for the sake of old times       yes   she said   i am fond of you       and you forgive me  you do forgive me for being such a brute  i  hardly knew what i was doing       yes   she said  speaking as one speaks in dreams   i forgive you       thank you   he said humbly   you were always generous  and you always  understand       wait  wait  i ll attend to you presently   she was saying to her  heart   yes  i know it s all over  i know the game s up  let me pull  through this without disgracing myself  and i ll let you hurt me as  much as you like afterwards       tell me   she said gently to vernon   tell me everything      he was silent  his face still hidden  he had cut the knot of an  impossible situation and he was pausing to admire the cleverness of  the stroke  in two minutes he had blotted out the last six  months  months in which he and she had been adversaries  he had thrown  himself on her mercy  and he had done wisely  never  even in the days  when he had carefully taught himself to be in love with her  had he  liked her so well as now  when she got up from her chair to come and  lay her hand softly on his shoulder and to say      my poor boy   but there s nothing for you to be unhappy about  tell  me all about it  from the very beginning      there was a luxurious temptation in the idea  it was not the first  time  naturally  that vernon had  told all about it  with a  sympathetic woman hand on his shoulder  he knew the strategic value of  confidences  but always he had made the confidences fit the  occasion  serve the end he had in view  now  such end as had been in  view was gained  he knew that it was only a matter of time now  before  she should tell him of her own accord  what he could never by any  brutality have forced her to tell  and the temptation to speak  for  once  the truth about himself was overmastering  it is a luxury one  can so very rarely afford  most of us go the whole long life way  without tasting it  there was nothing to lose by speaking the truth   moreover  he must say something  and why not the truth  so he said      it all comes of that confounded habit of mine of wanting to be in  love       yes   she said   you were always so anxious to be  weren t you  and  you never were  till now      the echo of his hidden thought made it easier for him to go on      it was at long barton   he said    it s a little dead and alive place  in kent  i was painting that picture that you like  the one that s in  the salon  and i was bored to death  and she walked straight into the  composition in a pink gown that made her look like a la france rose  that has been rained on  you know the sort of pink turning to mauve       and it was love at first sight   said she  and took away her hand      not it   said vernon  catching the hand and holding it   it was just  the usual thing  i wanted it to be like all the others       like mine   she said  looking down on him      nothing could be like  that    he had the grace to say  looking up at  her   that was only like the others in one thing  that it couldn t  last   what am i thinking of to let you stand there      he got up and led her to the divan  they sat down side by side  she  wanted to laugh  to sing  to scream  here was he sitting by her like a  lover  holding her hand  the first time these two years  three years  nearly  his voice tender as ever  and he was telling her about her      no   he went on  burrowing his shoulder comfortably in the cushions    it was just the ordinary outline sketch  but it was coming very  nicely  she was beginning to be interested  and i had taught myself  almost all that was needed  i didn t want to marry her  i didn t want  anything except those delicate delightful emotions that come before  one is quite  quite sure that she  but you know       yes   she said   i know       then her father interfered  and vulgarized the whole thing  he s a  parson  a weak little rat  but i was sorry for him  then an aunt came  on the scene  a most gentlemanly lady    he laughed a little at the  recollection    and i promised not to go out of my way to see her  again  it was quite easy  the bloom was already brushed from the  adventure  i finished the picture  and went to brittany and forgot the  whole silly business       there was some one in brittany  of course       of course   said he   there always is  i had a delightful summer   then in october  sitting at the cafe de la paix  i saw her pass  it  was the same day i saw you       before or after you saw me       after       then if i d stopped  if i d made you come for a drive then and there   you d never have seen her       that s so   said vernon   and by heaven i almost wish you had      the wish was a serpent in her heart  she said   go on      and he went on  and  warming to his subject  grew eloquent on the  events of the winter  his emotions  his surmises as to betty s  emotions  his slow awakening to the knowledge that now  for the first  time  and so on and so forth      you don t know how i tried to fall in love with you again   he said   and kissed her hand   you re prettier than she is  and cleverer and a  thousand times more adorable  but it s no good  it s a sort of  madness       you never were in love with me       no  i don t think i was  but i was happier with you than i shall ever  be with her for all that  talk of the joy of love  love hurts  hurts  damnably  i beg your pardon       yes  i believe it s painful  go on      he went on  he was enjoying himself  now  thoroughly      and so   the long tale ended   when i found she had scruples about  going about with me alone  because her father had suggested that i was  in love with her  i  i let her think that i was engaged to you       that is too much   she cried and would have risen  but he kept her  hand fast      ah  don t be angry   he pleaded   you see  i knew you didn t care  about me a little bit  and i never thought you and she would come  across each other       so you knew all the time that i didn t care   her self respect  clutched at the spar he threw out      of course  i m not such a fool as to think  ah  forgive me for  letting her think that  it bought me all i cared to ask for of her  time  she s so young  so innocent  she thought it was quite all right  as long as i belonged to someone else  and couldn t make love to her       and haven t you       never  never once  since the days at long barton when it had to be   made   and even then i only made the very beginnings of it  now        i suppose you ve been very  very happy       don t i tell you  i ve never been so wretched in my life  i despise  myself  i ve always made everything go as i wanted it to go  now i m  like a leaf in the wind   pauvre feuille desechee   don t you know   and i hate it  and i hate her being here without anyone to look after  her  a hundred times i ve had it on the tip of my pen to send that  doddering old underwood an anonymous letter  telling him all about  it       underwood       her step father   oh  i forgot  i didn t tell you   he proceeded to  tell her betty s secret  the death of madame gautier and betty s bid  for freedom      i see   she said slowly   well  there s no great harm done  but i  wish you d trusted me before  you wanted to know  at the beginning of  this remarkable interview   she laughed rather forlornly   what i had  told miss desmond  well  i went to see her  and when she told me that  you d told her you were engaged to me  i  i just acted the jealous a  little bit  i thought i was helping you  playing up to you  i suppose  i overdid it  i m sorry       the question is   said he anxiously   whether she ll forgive me for  that lie  she s most awfully straight  you know       she seems to have lied herself   lady st  craye could not help  saying      ah  yes  but only to her father       that hardly counts  you think       it s not the same thing as lying to the person you love  i wish  i  wonder whether you d mind if i never told her it was a lie  couldn t i  tell her that we were engaged but you ve broken it off  that you found  you liked temple better  or something      she gasped before the sudden vision of the naked gigantic egotism of a  man in love      you can tell her what you like   she said wearily   a lie or two more  or less  what does it matter       i don t want to lie to her   said vernon   i hate to  but she d never  understand the truth       you think  i  understand  it  is  the truth you ve been telling me      he laughed   i don t think i ever told so much truth in all my life       and you ve thoroughly enjoyed it  you alway did enjoy new  sensations       ah  don t sneer at me  you don t understand  not quite  everything s  changed  i really do feel as though i d been born again  the point of  view has shifted  and so suddenly  so completely  it s a new heaven  and a new earth  but the new earth s not comfortable  and i don t  suppose i shall ever get the new heaven  but you ll help me  you ll  advise me  do you think i ought to tell her at once  you see  she s so  different from other girls  she s        she isn t   lady st  craye interrupted   except that she s the one  you love  she s not a bit different from other girls  no girl s  different from other girls       ah  you don t know her   he said   you see  she s so young and brave  and true and  what is it  why       lady st  craye had rested her head against his coat sleeve and he knew  that she was crying      what is it  my dear  don t  you musn t cry       i m not   at least i m very tired       brute that i am   he said with late compunction   and i ve been  worrying you with all my silly affairs  cheer up   and smile at me  before i go  of course you re tired      his hand on her soft hair held her head against his arm      no   she said suddenly   it isn t that i m tired  really  you ve told  the truth   why shouldn t i   vernon instantly and deeply regretted  the lapse      you re really going to marry the girl  you mean it       yes       then i ll help you  i ll do everything i can for you       you re a dear   he said kindly   you always were       i ll be your true friend  oh  yes  i will  because i love you   eustace  i ve always loved you  i always shall  it can t spoil  anything now to tell you  because everything  is  spoilt  she ll never  love you like i do  nobody ever will       you re tired  i ve bothered you  you re saying this just  to  because        i m saying it because it s true  why should you be the only one to  speak the truth  oh  eustace  when you pretended to think i didn t  care  two years ago  i was too proud to speak the truth then  i m not  proud now any more  go away  i wish i d never seen you  i wish i d  never been born       yes  dear  yes  i ll go  he said  and rose  she buried her face in  the cushion where his shoulder had been     he was looking round for his hat and gloves  more uncomfortable than  he ever remembered to have been     as he reached the door she sprang up  and he heard the silken swish of  her gray gown coming towards him      say good night   she pleaded   oh  eustace  kiss me again  kindly   not like last time      he met her half way  took her in his arms and kissed her forehead very  gently  very tenderly      my dearest jasmine lady   he said   it sounds an impertinence and i  daresay you won t believe it  but i was never so sorry in my life as i  am now  i m a beast  and i don t deserve to live  think what a beast i  am  and try to hate me      she  clung to him and laid her wet cheek against his  then her lips  implored his lips  there was a long silence  it was she  she was  always glad of that  who at last found her courage  and drew back      good bye   she said   i shall be quite sane to morrow  and then i ll  help you      when he got out into the street he looked at his watch  it was not yet  ten o clock  he hailed a carriage      fifty seven boulevard montparnasse   he said     he could still feel lady st  craye s wet cheek against his own  the  despairing passion of her last kisses had thrilled him through and  through     he wanted to efface the mark of those kisses  he would not be haunted  all night by any lips but betty s     he had never called at her rooms in the evening  he had been careful  for her in that  even now as he rang the bell he was careful  and when  the latch clicked and the door was opened a cautious inch he was  ready  as he entered  to call out  in passing the concierge s door not  miss desmond s name  but the name of the canadian artist who occupied  the studio on the top floor     he went softly up the stairs and stood listening outside betty s door   then he knocked gently  no one answered  nothing stirred inside      she may be out   he told himself   i ll wait a bit      at the same time he tapped again  and this time beyond the door  something did stir     then came betty s voice       qui est la        it s me  vernon  may i come in      a moment s pause  then      no  you can t possibly  is anything the matter       no  oh  no  but i wanted so much to see you  may i come to morrow  early       you re sure there s nothing wrong  at home or anything  you haven t  come to break anything to me       no  no  it s only something i wanted to tell you      he began to feel a fool  with his guarded whispers through a locked  door      then come at twelve   said betty in the tones of finality    good night      he heard an inner door close  and went slowly away  he walked a long  way that night  it was not till he was back in his rooms and had  lighted his candle and wound up his watch that lady st  craye s kisses  began to haunt him in good earnest  as he had known they would                                                 lady st  craye  left alone  dried her eyes and set to work  with heart  still beating wildly to look about her at the ruins of her world     the room was quiet with the horrible quiet of a death chamber  and yet  his voice still echoed in it  only a moment ago she had been in his  arms  as she had never hoped to be again  more  as she had never been  before      he would have loved me now   she told herself   if it hadn t been for  that girl  he didn t love me before  he was only playing at love  he  didn t know what love was  but he knows now  and it s all too late      but was it     a word to betty  and       but you promised to help him       that was before he kissed me       but a promise is a promise       yes   and your life s your life  you ll never have another      she stood still  her hands hanging by her sides  clenched hands that  the rings bit into      he will go to her early to morrow  and she ll accept him  of course   she s never seen anyone else  the little fool      she knew that she herself would have taken him  would have chosen him  as the chief among ten thousand      she could have temple  she d be much happier with temple  she and  eustace would make each other wretched  she d never understand him   and he d be tired of her in a week      she had turned up the electric lights now  at her toilet table  and  was pulling the pins out of her ruffled hair      and he d never care about her children  and they d be ugly little  horrors      she was twisting her hair up quickly and firmly      i  have  a right to live my own life   she said  just as betty had  said six months before   why am i to sacrifice everything to  her  especially when i don t suppose she cares  and now that i know i  could get him if she were out of the way      she looked at herself in the silver framed mirror and laughed      and you always thought yourself a proud woman      suddenly she dropped the brush  it rattled and spun on the polished  floor     she stamped her foot      that settles it   she said  for in that instant she perceived quite  clearly and without mistake that vernon s attitude had been a  parti pris  that he had thrown  himself on her pity of set purpose   with an end to gain      laughing at me all the time too  of course  and i thought i  understood him  well  i don t misunderstand him for long  anyway   she  said  and picked up the hair brush      you silly fool   she said to the woman in the glass     and now she was fully dressed  in long light coat and a hat with  as  usual  violets in it  she paused a moment before her writing table   turned up its light  turned it down again      no   she said   one doesn t write anonymous letters  besides it would  be too late  he ll see her to morrow early  early      the door of the flat banged behind her as it had banged behind vernon  half an hour before  like him  she called a carriage  and on her lips  too  as the chill april air caressed them  was the sense of kisses     and she  too  gave to the coachman the address     fifty seven boulevard montparnasse           chapter xix       the truth with a vengeance     in those three weeks whose meetings with vernon had been so lacking in  charm there had been other meetings for betty  and in these charm had  not been to seek  but it was the charm of restful  pleasant  companionship illuminated by a growing certainty that mr  temple  admired her very much  that he liked her very much  that he did not  think her untidy and countrified and ill dressed  and all the things  she had felt herself to be that night when lady st  craye and her furs  had rustled up the staircase at thirion s  and she had dined with mr   temple and lunched with mr  temple  and there had been an afternoon at  st  cloud  and a day at versailles  miss voscoe and some of the other  students had been in the party  but not of it as far as betty was  concerned  she had talked to temple all the time      i m glad to see you ve taken my advice   said miss voscoe   only you  do go at things so  like a bull at a gate  a month ago it was all that  ruffian vernon  now it s all mr  go to hell  why not have a change   try a pole or a german      but betty declined to try a pole or a german     what she wanted to do was to persuade herself that she liked temple as  much as she liked vernon  and  further  that she did not care a straw  for either     of course it is very wrong indeed to talk pleasantly with a young man  when you think you know that he might  just possibly  be falling in  love with you  but then it is very interesting  too  to be loved  even  by the wrong person  seems in youth s selfish eyes to light up the  world as the candle lights the japanese lantern  and besides  after  all  one can t be sure  and it is not maidenly to say  no   even by  the vaguest movements of retreat  to a question that has not been  asked and perhaps never will be     and when she was talking to temple she was not thinking so much of  vernon  and of her unselfish friendship for him  and the depth of her  hope that he really  would  be happy with that woman     so that it was with quite a sick feeling that her days had been robbed  of something that made them easier to live  if not quite worth living   that she read and reread the letter that she found waiting for her  after that last unsuccessful dinner with the man whom temple helped  her to forget     you will see by the letter what progress friendship can make in a  month between a young man and woman  even when each is half in love  with some one else        sweet friend   said the letter   this is to say good bye for a    little while  but you will think of me when i am away  won t you     i am going into the country to make some sketches and to think  i    don t believe it is possible for english people to think in paris     and i have things to think over that won t let themselves be thought    over quietly here  and i want to see the spring  i won t ask you to    write to me  because i want to be quite alone  and not to have even    a word from my sweet and dear friend  i hope your work will go well        yours        robert temple      betty  in bed  was re reading this when vernon s knock came at her  door  she spoke to him through the door with the letter in her hand   and her real thought when she asked him if he had come to break bad  news was that something had happened to temple     she went back to bed  but not to sleep  try as she would  she could  not keep away the wonder  what could vernon have had to say that  wanted so badly to get itself said  she hid her eyes and would not  look in the face of her hope  there had been a tone in his voice as he  whispered on the other side of that stupid door  a tone she had not  heard since long barton     oh  why had she gone to bed early that night of all nights  she would  never go to bed early again as long as she lived     what   no  impossible  yes  another knock at her door  she sprang out  of bed  and stood listening  there was no doubt about it  vernon had  come back  after all what he had to say would not keep till morning  a  wild idea of dressing and letting him in was sternly dismissed  for  one thing  at topmost speed  it took twenty minutes to dress  he would  not wait twenty minutes  another knock     she threw on her dressing gown and ran along her little passage  and  stooped to the key hole just as another tap  discreet but insistent   rang on the door panel      go away   she said low and earnestly   i can t talk to you to night   whatever it is   it must wait till the morning       it s i   said the very last voice in all paris that she expected to  hear   it s lady st  craye   won t you let me in       are you alone   said betty      of course i m alone  it s most important  do open the door      the door was slowly opened  the visitor rustled through  and betty  shut the door  then she followed lady st  craye into the sitting room   lighted the lamp  drew the curtain across the clear april night  and  stood looking enquiry  and not looking it kindly  her lips were set in  a hard line and she was frowning     she waited for the other to speak  but after all it was she who broke  the silence      well   she said   what do you want now       i hardly know how to begin   said lady st  craye with great truth      i should think not   said betty   i don t want to be disagreeable   but i can t think of anything that gives you the right to come and  knock me up like this in the middle of the night       it s only just past eleven   said lady st  craye  and there was  another silence  she did not know what to say  a dozen openings  suggested themselves  and were instantly rejected  then  quite  suddenly  she knew exactly what to say  what to do  that move of  vernon s  it was a good one  a move too often neglected in this  cynical world  but always successful on the stage      may i sit down   she asked forlornly     betty  rather roughly  pushed forward a chair     lady st  craye sank into it  looked full at betty for a long minute   and by the lamp s yellow light betty saw the tears rise  brim over and  fall from the other woman s lashes  then lady st  craye pulled out her  handkerchief and began to cry in good earnest     it was quite easy     at first betty looked on in cold contempt  lady st  craye had counted  on that  she let herself go  wholly  if it ended in hysterics so much  the more impressive  she thought of vernon  of all the hopes of these  months  of the downfall of them  everything that should make it  impossible for her to stop crying      don t distress yourself   said betty  very chill and distant      can you  can you lend me a handkerchief   said the other  unexpectedly  screwing up her own drenched cambric in her hand     betty fetched a handkerchief      i haven t any scent   she said   i m sorry      that nearly dried the tears  but not quite  lady st  craye was a  persevering woman     betty watching her  slowly melted  just as the other knew she would   she put her hand at last on the shoulder of the light coat      come   she said   don t cry so  i m sure there s nothing to be so  upset about       then came to her sharp as any knife  the thought of what there might  be      there s nothing wrong with anyone  there hasn t been an accident or  anything      the other  still speechless  conveyed  no       don t   said betty again  and slowly and very artistically the flood  was abated  lady st  craye was almost calm  though still her breath  caught now and then in little broken sighs      i  am  so sorry   she said   so ashamed   breaking down like this   you don t know what it is to be as unhappy as i am      betty thought she did  we all think we do  in the presence of any  grief not our own      can i do anything   she spoke much more kindly than she had expected  to speak      will you let me tell you everything  the whole truth       of course if you want to  but        then do sit down  and oh  don t be angry with me  i am so wretched   just now you thought something had happened to mr  vernon  will you  just tell me one thing   do you love him       you ve no right to ask me that       i know i haven t  well  i ll trust you  though you don t trust me   i ll tell you everything  two years ago mr  vernon and i were  engaged      this was not true  but it took less time to tell than the truth would  have taken  and sounded better      we were engaged  and i was very fond of him  but he  you know what he  is about women       no   said betty steadily   i don t want to hear anything about him       but you must   he is  i don t know how to put it  there s always some  woman besides the one with him  i understand that now  i didn t then   i don t think he can help it  it s his temperament       i see   said betty evenly  her hands and feet were very cold  she was  astonished to find how little moved she was in this interview whose  end she foresaw so very plainly      yes  and there was a girl at that time  he was always about with her   and i made him scenes  always a most stupid thing to do with a man   you know  and at last i said he must give her up  or give me up  and  he gave me up  and i was too proud to let him think i cared  and just  to show him how little i cared i married sir harry st  craye  i might  just as well have let it alone  he never even heard i had been married  till last october  and then it was i who told him  my husband was a  brute  and i m thankful to say he didn t live long  you re very much  shocked  i m afraid       not at all   said betty  who was  rather      well  then i met him again  and we got engaged again  as he told you   and again there was a girl  oh  and another woman besides  but this  time i tried to bear it  you know i did try not to be jealous of you       you had no cause   said betty      well  i thought i had  that hurts just as much  and what s the end of  it all  all my patience and trying not to see things  and letting him  have his own way  he came to me to night and begged me to release him  from his engagement  because  oh  he was beautifully candid  because  he meant to marry you      betty s heart gave a jump      he seems to have been very sure of me   she said loftily      no  no  he s not a hairdresser s apprentice  to tell one woman that  he s sure of another  he said   i mean to marry miss desmond if she ll  have me        how kind of him       i wish you d heard the way he spoke of you       i don t want to hear        i  had to  and i ve released him  and now i ve come to you  i was  proud two years ago  i m not proud now  i don t care what i do  i ll  kneel down at your feet and pray to you as if you were god not to take  him away from me  and if you love him it ll all be no good  i know  that       but  supposing i weren t here  do you think you could get him back       i know i could  unless of course you were to tell him i d been here  to night  i should have no chance after that  naturally  i wish i knew  what to say to you  you re very young  you ll find someone else  a  better man  he s not a good man  there s a girl at montmartre at this  very moment  a girl he s set up in a restaurant  he goes to see her   you d never stand that sort of thing  i know the sort of girl you are   and you re quite right  but i ve got beyond that  i don t care what he  is  i don t care what he does  i understand him  i can make allowances  for him  i m his real mate  i could make him happy  you never  would  you re too good  ever since i first met him i ve thought of  nothing else  cared for nothing else  if he whistled to me i d give up  everything else  everything  and follow him barefoot round the world       i heard someone say that in a play once   said betty musing      so did i   said lady st  craye very sharply   but it s true for all  that  well  you can do as you like       of course i can   said betty      i ve done all i can now  i ve said everything there is to say  and if  you love him as i love him every word i ve said won t make a scrap of  difference  i know that well enough  what i want to know is   do  you  love him      the scene had been set deliberately  but the passion that spoke in it  was not assumed  betty felt young  school girlish  awkward in the  presence of this love  so different from her own timid dreams  the  emotion of the other woman had softened her      i don t know   she said      if you don t know  you don t love him   at least don t see him till  you re sure  you ll do that  as long as he s not married to anyone   there s just a chance that he may love me again  won t you have pity   won t you go away like that sensible young man temple  mr  vernon told  me he was going into the country to decide which of the two women he  likes best is the one he really likes best  won t you do that       yes   said betty slowly   i ll do that   look  here  i am most  awfully sorry  but i don t know  i can t think to night  i ll go right  away  i won t see him to morrow  oh  no  i can t come between you and  the man you re engaged to   her thoughts were clearing themselves as  she spoke   of course i knew you were engaged to him  but i never  thought  at least  yes  i ll go away the first thing to morrow       you are very  very good   said lady st  craye  and she meant it      but i don t know where to go  tell me where to go       can t you go home       no  i won t  that s too much       go somewhere and sketch       yes   but  where    said poor betty impatiently      go to grez   said the other  not without second thoughts   it s a  lovely place  close to fontainebleau  hotel chevillon  i ll write it  down for you   old madame chevillon s a darling  she ll look after  you  it  is  good of you to forgive me for everything  i m afraid i  was a cat to you       no   said betty   it was right and brave of you to tell me the whole  truth  oh  truth s the only thing that s any good      lady st  craye also thought it a useful thing  in moderation  she  rose      i ll never forget what you re doing for me   she said   you re a girl  in thousand  look here  my dear  i m not blind  don t think i don t  value what you re doing  you cared for him in england a little   and  you care a little now  and everything i ve said tonight has hurt you  hatefully  and you didn t know you cared  you thought it was  friendship  didn t you  till you thought i d come to tell you that  something had happened to him  and then you  knew   i m going to  accept your sacrifice  i ve got to  i can t live if i don t  but i  don t want you to think i don t know what a sacrifice it is  i know  better than you do  at this moment  no  don t say anything  i don t  want to force your confidence  but i do understand       i wish everything was different   said betty      yes  you re thinking  aren t you  that if it hadn t been for mr   vernon you d rather have liked me  and i know now that if it hadn t  been for him i should have been very fond of you  and even as it is       she put her arms round betty and spoke close to her ear      you re doing more for me than anyone has ever done for me in my  life   she said   more than i d do for you or any woman  and i love  you for it  dear brave little girl  i hope it isn t going to hurt very  badly  i love you for it  and i ll never forget it to the day i die   kiss me and try to forgive me      the two clung together for an instant      good bye   said lady st  craye in quite a different voice   i m sorry  i made a scene  but  really  sometimes i believe one isn t quite sane   let me write the grez address  i wish i could think of any set of  circumstances in which you d be pleased to see me again       i ll pack to night   said betty   i hope  you ll  be happy anyway  do  you know i think i have been hating you rather badly without quite  knowing it       of course you have   said the other heartily   but you don t now  of  course you won t leave your address here  if you do that you might as  well not go away at all       i m not quite a fool   said betty      no   said the other with a sigh   it s i that am the fool   you re  no  i won t say what you are  but  well  good night  dear  try  not to hate me again when you come to think it all over quietly            chapter xx       waking up time       dear mr  vernon  this is to thank you very much for all your help    and criticism of my work  and to say good bye  i am called away    quite suddenly  so i can t thank you in person  but i shall never    forget your kindness  please remember me to lady st  craye  i    suppose you will be married quite soon now  and i am sure you will    both be very happy       yours very sincerely       elizabeth desmond     this was the letter that vernon read standing in the shadow of the  arch by the concierge s window  the concierge had hailed him as he  hurried through to climb the wide shallow stairs and to keep his  appointment with betty when she should leave the atelier      but yes  mademoiselle had departed this morning at nine o clock  to  which station  to the gare st  lazare  yes  mademoiselle had charged  her to remit the billet to monsieur  no  mademoiselle had not left any  address  but perhaps chez madame bianchi      but chez madame bianchi there was no further news  the so amiable  mademoiselle desmond had paid her account  had embraced madame   and  voila  she was gone  one divined that she had been called  suddenly to return to the family roof  a sudden illness of monsieur  her father without doubt     could some faint jasmine memory have lingered on the staircase  or was  it some subtler echo of lady st  craye s personality that clung there   abruptly  as he passed betty s door  the suspicion stung him  had the  jasmine lady had any hand in this sudden departure      pooh  nonsense   he said  but all the same he paused at the  concierge s window      i am desolated to have deranged madame    gold coin changed  hands    a lady came to see mademoiselle this morning  is it not       no  no lady had visited mademoiselle to day  no one at all in  effect       nor last night  very late       no  monsieur   the woman answered meaningly   no visitor came in last  night except monsieur himself and he came  not to see mademoiselle   that understands itself  but to see monsieur beauchesne an troisieme   no  i am quite sure  i never deceive myself  and mademoiselle has had  no letters since three days  thanks a thousand times  monsieur  good  morning      she locked up the gold piece in the little drawer where already lay  the hundred franc note that lady st  craye had given her at six  o clock that morning      and there ll be another fifty from her next month   she chuckled    the good god be blessed for intrigues  without intrigues what would  become of us poor concierges      for vernon paris was empty  the spring sunshine positively  distasteful  he did what he could  he enquired at the gare st  lazare   describing betty with careful detail that brought smiles to the lips  of the employes  he would not call on miss voscoe  he made himself  wait till the sketch club afternoon  made himself wait  indeed  till  all the sketches were criticised  till the last cup of tea was  swallowed  or left to cool  the last cake munched  the last student s  footfall had died away on the stairs  and he and miss voscoe were  alone among the scattered tea cups  blackened bread crumbs and torn  paper     then he put his question  miss voscoe knew nothing  guessed miss  desmond knew her own business best      but she s so young   said vernon   anything might have happened to  her       i reckon she s safe enough  where she is   said miss voscoe with  intention      but haven t you any idea why she s gone   he asked  not at all  expecting any answer but  not the least      but miss voscoe said      i have a quite first class idea and so have you      he could but beg her pardon interrogatively      oh  you know well enough   said she   she d got to go  and it was up  to her to do it right now  i guess      vernon had to ask why      well  you being engaged to another girl  don t you surmise it might  kind of come home to her there were healthier spots for you than the  end of her apron strings  maybe she thought the other lady s apron  strings  ud be suffering for a little show       i m not engaged   said vernon shortly      then it s time you were   the answer came with equal shortness    you ll pardon me making this a heart to heart talk  and anyway it s  no funeral of mine  but she s the loveliest girl and i right down like  her  so you take it from me  that f f v  lady with the violets  oh   don t pretend you don t know who i mean  the one you re always about  with when you aren t with betty   she s  your ticket  betty s not   your friend s her style  you pass  this hand  and give the girl a  chance       i really don t understand        i bet you do   she interrupted with conviction   i ve sized you up  right enough  mr  vernon  you re no fool  if you ve discontinued your  engagement betty doesn t know it  nor she shan t from me  and one of  these next days it ll be borne in on your friend that she s  the  girl  of his life  and when he meets her again he ll get her to see it his  way  don t you spoil the day s fishing      vernon laughed      you have all the imagination of the greatest nation in the world   miss voscoe   he said   thank you  these straight talks to young men  are the salt of life  good bye       you haven t all the obfuscation of the stupidest nation in the  world   she retorted   if you had had you d have had a chance to find  out what straight talking means  which it s my belief you never have  yet  good bye  you take my tip  either you go back to where you were  before you sighted betty  or if the other one s sick of you too  just  shuffle the cards  take a fresh deal and start fair  you go home and  spend a quiet evening and think it all over      vernon went off laughing  and wondering why he didn t hate miss  voscoe  he did not laugh long  he sat in his studio  musing till  it was too late to go out to dine  then he found some biscuits  and sherry  remnants of preparations for the call of a picture  dealer  ate and drank  and spent the evening in the way recommended  by miss voscoe  he lay face downward on the divan  in the dark  and  he did  think it all over      but first there was the long time when he lay quite still  did not  think at all  only remembered her hands and her eyes and her hair  and  the pretty way her brows lifted when she was surprised or  perplexed  and the four sudden sweet dimples that came near the  corners of her mouth when she was amused  and the way her mouth  drooped when she was tired      i want you  i want you  i want you   said the man who had been the  amorist   i want you  dear      when he did begin to think  he moved uneasily in the dark as thought  after thought crept out and stung him and slunk away  the verses he  had written at long barton  ironic verses  written with the tongue in  the cheek  came back with the force of iron truth        i love you to my heart s hid core        those other loves  how can one learn       from marshlights how the great fires burn     ah  no  i never loved before      he had smiled at temple s confidences  when betty was at hand  to be  watched and guarded  now betty was away  anywhere  and temple was  deciding whether it was she whom he loved  suppose he did decide that  it was she  and  as miss voscoe had said  made her see it   damn    said vernon   oh  damn      he was beginning to be a connoisseur in the fine flavours of the  different brands of jealousy  anyway there was food for thought     there was food for little else  in the days that followed  mr   vernon s heart  hungry for the first time  had to starve  he went  often to lady st  craye s  she was so gentle  sweet  yet not too  sympathetic  bright  amusing even  but not too vivacious  he approved  deeply the delicacy with which she ignored that last wild interview   she was sister  she was friend  and she had the rare merit of seeming  to forget that she had been confidante     it was he who re opened the subject  after ten days  she had told  herself that it was only a question of time  and it was      do you know she s disappeared   he said abruptly       disappeared    no one was ever more astonished than lady st  craye   quite natural  the astonishment  not overdone by so much as a hair s  breadth     so he told her all about it  and she twisted her long topaz chain and  listened with exactly the right shade of interest  he told her what  miss voscoe had said  at least most of it      and i worry about temple   he said   like any school boy  i worry  if  he  does  decide that he loves her better than you  you said you d  help me  can t you make sure that he won t love her better       i could  i suppose   she admitted  to herself she said   temple s at  grez   she s  at grez  they ve been there ten days       if only you would   he said   it s too much to ask  i know  but i  can t ask anything that isn t too much  and you re so much more noble  and generous than other people        no butter  thanks   she said      it s the best butter   he earnestly urged   i mean that i mean it   won t you       when i see him again  but it s not very fair to him  is it       he s an awfully good chap  you know   said vernon innocently  and  once more lady st  craye bowed before the sublime apparition of the  egoism of man      good enough for me  you think  well  perhaps you re right  he s a  dear boy  one would feel very safe if one loved a man like that       yes  wouldn t one   said vernon     she wondered whether betty was feeling safe  no  ten days are a long  time  especially in the country  but it would take longer than that to  cure even a little imbecile like betty of the vernon habit  it was  worse than opium  who ought to know if not she who sat  calm and  sympathetic  promising to entangle temple so as to leave betty free to  become a hopeless prey to the fell disease     quite suddenly and to her own intense surprise  she laughed out loud      what is it   his alert vanity bristled in the query      it s nothing  only everything  life s so futile  we pat and pinch our  little bit of clay  and look at it and love it and think it s going to  be a masterpiece   and then god glances at it  and he doesn t like  the modelling  and he sticks his thumb down  and the whole thing s  broken up  and there s nothing left to do but throw away the bits       oh  no   said vernon   everything s bound to come right in the end   it all works out straight somehow      she laughed again      optimism  from you       it s not optimism   he asserted eagerly   it s only  well  if  everything doesn t come right somehow  somewhere  some day  what did  he bother to make the world for       that s exactly what i said  my dear   said she  she permitted herself  the little endearment now and then with an ironical inflection  as one  fearful of being robbed might show a diamond pretending that it was  paste      you think he made it for a joke       if he did it s a joke in the worst possible taste   said she   but i  see your point of view  there can t be so very much wrong with a world  that has her in it   and you  and possibilities       do you know   he said slowly   i m not at all sure that  do you  remember the chap in jane eyre   he knew quite well that that rosamund  girl wouldn t make him the wife he wanted  yet he wanted nothing else   i don t want anything but her  and it doesn t make a scrap of  difference that i know exactly what sort of fool i am       a knowledge of anatomy doesn t keep a broken bone from hurting   said  she   and all even you know about love won t keep off the heartache  i  could have told you that long ago       i know i m a fool   he said   but i can t help it  sometimes i think  i wouldn t help it if i could       i know   she said  and something in her voice touched the trained  sensibilities of the amorist  he stooped to kiss the hand that teased  the topazes      dear jasmine lady   he said   my optimism doesn t keep its colour  long  does it  give me some tea  won t you  there s nothing so  wearing as emotion      she gave him tea      it s a sort of judgment on you  though   was what she gave him with  his first cup   you ve dealt out this very thing to so many  women   and now it s come home to roost       i didn t know what a fearful wildfowl it was   he answered smiling    i swear i didn t  i begin to think i never knew anything at all  before       and yet they say love s blind       and so he is  that s just it  my exotic flower of optimism withers at  your feet  it s all exactly the muddle you say it is  pray heaven for  a clear way out  meantime thank whatever gods may be  i ve got  you        monsieur s confidante is always at his distinguished service   she  said  and thus sealed the fountain of confidences for that day     but it broke forth again and again in the days that came after  for  now he saw her almost every day  and for her  to be with him  to know  that she had of him more of everything  save the heart  than any other  woman  spelled something wonderfully like happiness  more like it than  she had the art to spell in any other letters     vernon still went twice a week to the sketch club  to have stayed away  would have been to confess  to the whole alert and interested class   that he had only gone there for the sake of betty     those afternoons were seasons of salutary torture     he tried very hard to work  but  though he still remembered how a  paint brush should be handled  there seemed no good reason for using  one  he had always found his planned and cultivated emotions strongly  useful in forwarding his work  this undesired unrest mocked at work   and at all the things that had made up the solid fabric of one s days   the ways of love  he had called it love  it was a name like  another  had merely been a sort of dram drinking  such love was the  intoxicant necessary to transfigure life to the point where all  things  even work  look beautiful  now he tasted the real draught  it  flooded his veins like fire and stung like poison  and it made work   and all things else  look mean and poor and unimportant      i want you  i want you  i want you   said vernon to the vision with  the pretty kitten face  and the large gray eyes   i want you more than  everything in the world   he said   everything in the world put  together  oh  come back to me  dear  dear  dear      he was haunted without cease by the little poem he had written when he  was training himself to be in love with betty        i love you to my heart s hid core        those other loves  how should one learn       from marshlights how the great fires burn     ah  no  i never loved before       prophetic  i suppose   he said   though god knows i never meant it   any fool of a prophet must hit the bull s eye at least once in a life   but there was a curious unanimity of prophecy about this  the aunt  warned me  that conway woman warned me  the jasmine lady warned me   and now it s happened   he told himself   and i who thought i knew all  about everything      miss conway s name  moving through his thoughts  left the trail of a  new hope     next day he breakfasted at montmartre     the neatest little cremerie  white paint  green walls stenciled with  fat white geraniums  on each small table a vase of green bruges ware  or breton pottery holding not a crushed crowded bouquet  but one  single flower  a pink tulip  a pink carnation  a pink rose  on the  desk from behind which the proprietress ruled her staff  enormous pink  peonies in a tall pot of grez de flandre     behind the desk paula conway  incredibly neat and business like  her  black hair severely braided  her plain black gown fitting a figure  grown lean as any grey hound s  her lace collar a marvel of fine  laundry work     dapper waisted waitresses in black  with white aprons  served the  customers  vernon was served by madame herself  the clientele formed  its own opinion of the cause of this  her only such condescension      well  and how s trade   he asked over his asparagus      trade s beautiful   paula answered  with the frank smile that betty  had seen  only once or twice  and had loved very much   if trade will  only go on behaving like this for another six weeks my cruel creditor  will be paid every penny of the money that launched me      her eyes dwelt on him with candid affection      your cruel creditor s not in any hurry   he said   by the way  i  suppose you ve not heard anything of miss desmond       how could i  you know you made me write that she wasn t to write       i didn t  make  you write anything       you approved  but anyway she hasn t my address  why       she s gone away  and she also has left no address       you don t think   oh  no  nothing  could  have happened to her       no  no   he hastened to say   i expect her father sent for her  or  fetched her       the best thing too   said paula   i always wondered he let her come       yes    vernon remembered how little paula knew      oh  yes  she s probably gone home       look here   said miss conway very earnestly   there wasn t any love  business between you and her  was there       no   he answered strongly      i was always afraid of that  do you know  if you don t mind  when  i ve really paid my cruel creditor everything  i should like to write  and tell her what he s done for me  i should like her to know that she  really  did  save me  and how  because if it hadn t been for her you d  never have thought of helping me  do you think i might       it could do no harm   said vernon after a silent moment   you d  really like her to know you re all right  you  are  all right       i m right  as i never thought i could be ever again       well  you needn t exaggerate the little services of your cruel  creditor  come to think of it  you needn t name him  just say it was a  man you knew      but when paula came to write the letter that was not just what she  said           book     the other man          chapter xxi       the flight     the full sunlight streamed into the room when betty  her packing done   drew back the curtain  she looked out on the glazed roof of the  laundry  the lead roof of the office  the blank wall of the new  grocery establishment in the rue de rennes  only a little blue sky  shewed at the end of the lane  between roofs  by which the sun came  in  not a tree  not an inch of grass  in sight  only  in her room   half a dozen roses that temple had left for her  and the white  marguerite plant  tall  sturdy  a little tree almost  that vernon had  sent in from the florist s next door but two  everything was packed   she would say good bye to madame bianchi  and she would go  and leave  no address  as she had promised last night      why did you promise   she asked herself  and herself replied      don t you bother  we ll talk about all that when we ve got away from  paris  he was quite right  you can t think here       you d better tell the cabman some other station  that cat of a  concierge is sure to be listening       ah  right  i don t want to give him any chance of finding me  even if  he did say he wanted to marry me      a fleet lovely picture of herself in bridal smart travelling clothes  arriving at the rectory on vernon s arm      aren t you sorry you misjudged him so  father   gentle accents  refraining from reproach  a very pretty picture  yes  dismissed     now the carriage swaying under the mound of betty s luggage starts for  the gare du nord  in the rue notre dame des champs betty opens her  mouth to say   gare de lyons   no  this is  his  street  better cross  it as quickly as may be  at the church of st  germain  yes     the coachman smiles at the new order  like the concierge he scents an  intrigue  whips up his horse  and swings round to the left along the  prettiest of all the boulevards  between the full leafed trees  past  thirion s  ah     that thought  or pang  or nausea  betty doesn t quite know what it  is  keeps her eyes from the streets till the carriage is crossing the  river  why  there is notre dame  it ought to be miles away  suppose  vernon should have been leaning out of his window when she passed  across the street  seen her  divined her destination  followed her in  the fleetest carriage accessible  the vision of a meeting at the  station      why are you going away  what have i done   the secret of this  her  great renunciation  the whole life s sacrifice to that life s  idol  honor  wrung from her  a hand that would hold hers  under  pretence of taking her bundle of rugs to carry   she wished the  outermost rug were less shabby  vernon s voice      but i can t let you go  why ruin two lives  nay  three  for it is you  only that i       dismissed     it is very hot  paris is the hottest place in the world  betty is glad  she brought lavender water in her bag  wishes she had put on her other  hat  this brown one is hot  and besides  if vernon  were  to be at the  station  interval  dismissed     betty has never before made a railway journey alone  this gives one a  forlorn feeling  suppose she has to pay excess on her luggage  or to  wrangle about contraband  she has heard all about the octroi  is  lavender water smuggling  and what can they do to you for it  vernon  would know all these things  and if he were going into the country he  would be wearing that almost white rough suit of his and the panama  hat  a rose  madame abel de chatenay  would go well with that coat   why didn t brides consult their bridegrooms before they bought their  trousseaux  you should get your gowns to rhyme with your husband s  suits  a dream of a dress that would be  with all the shades of madame  abel cunningly blended  a honeymoon lasts at least a month  the roses  would all be out at long barton by the time they walked up that  moss grown drive  and stood at the rectory door  and she murmured in  the ear of the reverend cecil   aren t you sorry you       dismissed  and perforce  for the station was reached     betty  even in the brown hat  attracted the most attractive of the  porters  also  of course  the most attractable  he thought he spoke  english  and though this was not so  yet the friendly blink of his  breton blue eyes and his encouraging smile gave to his      bourron  mais oui  dix heures vingt  par ici  meess  je m occuperai  de vous  et des bagages aussi  all right   quite the ring of one s  mother tongue     he made everything easy for betty  found her a carriage without  company   i can cry here if i like   said the betty that betty liked  least   arranged her small packages neatly in the rack  took her     centime piece as though it had been a priceless personal souvenir  and  ran half the length of the platform to get a rose from another  porter s button hole  he handed it to her through the carriage window       pour egayer le voyage de meess   all right   he smiled  and was  gone     she settled herself in the far corner  and took off her hat  the  carriage was hot as any kitchen  with her teeth she drew the cork of  the lavender water bottle  and with her handkerchief dabbed the  perfume on forehead and ears      ah  mademoiselle   de grace     the voice came through the open  window beside her  a train full of young soldiers was beside her  train  and in the window opposite hers three boys  faces crowded to  look at her  three hands held out three handkerchiefs  not very white  certainly  but      betty smiling reached out the bottle and poured lavender water on each  outheld handkerchief       ah  le bon souvenir    said one      we shall think of the beauty of an angel of mademoiselle every time  we smell the perfume so delicious   said the second      and longer than that  oh  longer than that by all a life   cried the  third     the train started  the honest  smiling boy faces disappeared   instinctively she put her head out of the window to look back at them   all three threw kisses at her      i ought to be offended   said betty  and instantly kissed her hand in  return      how  nice  french people are   she said as she sank back on the hot  cushions     and now there was leisure to think  real thoughts  not those broken   harassing dreamings that had buzzed about her between    boulevard  montparnasse and the station  also  as some one had suggested  one  could cry     she leaned back  eyes shut  her next thought was      i have been to sleep      she had  the train was moving out of a station labelled fontainebleau      and oh  the trees   said betty   the green thick trees  and the sky   you can see the sky      through the carriage window she drank delight from the far grandeur of  green distances  the intimate beauty of green rides  green vistas  as  a thirsty carter drinks beer from the cool lip of his can  a thirsty  lover madness from the warm lips of his mistress      oh  how good  how green and good   she told herself over and over  again till the words made a song with the rhythm of the blundering  train and the humming metals      bourron      her station  little  quiet  sunlit  like the station at long barton  a  flaming broom bush and the white of may and acacia blossom beyond prim  palings  no platform  a long leap to the dusty earth  the train went  on  and betty and her boxes seemed dropped suddenly at the world s  end     the air was fresh and still  a chestnut tree reared its white blossoms  like the candles on a christmas tree for giant children  the white  dust of the platform sparkled like diamond dust  may trees and  laburnums shone like silver and gold  and the sun was warm and the  tree shadows black on the grass  and betty loved it all       oh    she said suddenly   it s a year ago to day since i met   him   in the warren      a shadow caressed and stung her  she would have liked it to wear the  mask of love foregone  to have breathed plaintively of hopes defeated  and a broken heart  instead it shewed the candid face of a real  homesickness  and it spoke with convincing and abominably aggravating  plainness  of long barton     the little hooded diligence was waiting in the hot white dust outside  the station      but yes   it is i who transport all the guests of madame chevillon    said the smiling brown haired bonnetless woman who held the reins     betty climbed up beside her     along a straight road that tall ranks of trees guarded but did not  shade  through the patchwork neatness of the little culture that makes  the deep difference between peasant france and pastoral england  down  a steep hill into a little white town  where vines grew out of the  very street to cling against the faces of the houses and wistaria hung  its mauve pendants from every arch and lintel     the hotel chevillon is a white faced house  with little unintelligent  eyes of windows  burnt blind  it seems  in the sun  neat with the  neatness of provincial france     out shuffled an old peasant woman in short skirt  heavy shoes and big  apron  her arms bared to the elbow  a saucepan in one hand  a ladle in  the other  she beamed at betty      i wish to see madame chevillon       you see her   ma belle et bonne    chuckled the old woman   it is me   madame chevillon  you will rooms  is it not  you are artist  all who  come to the hotel are artist  rooms  marie shall show you the rooms   at the instant even  all the rooms  except one  that is the room of  the english artist  all that there is of most amiable  but quite mad   he wears no hat  and his brain boils in the sun  mademoiselle can chat  with him  it will prevent that she bores herself here in the forest      betty disliked the picture      i think perhaps   she said  translating mentally as she spoke   that  i should do better to go to another hotel  if there is only one man  here and he is       she saw days made tiresome by the dodging of a lunatic  nights made  tremulous by a lunatic s yelling soliloquies      ah   said madame chevillon comfortably   i thought mademoiselle was  artist  and for the artists and the spaniards the  convenances  exist  not  but mademoiselle is also english  they eat the convenances every  day with the soup   see then  my cherished  the english man  he is not  a dangerous fool  only a beast of the good god  he has the atelier and  the room at the end of the corridor  but there is  besides the hotel   the garden pavilion  un appartement of two rooms  exquisite  on the  first  and the garden room that opens big upon the terrace  it is  there that mademoiselle will be well      betty thought so too  when she had seen the  rooms exquisite on the  first   neat  bare  well scrubbed rooms with red tiled floors  scanty  rugs and frenchly varnished furniture  the garden room too  with big  open hearth and no furniture but wicker chairs and tables      mademoiselle can eat all alone on the terrace  the english mad shall  not approach  i will charge myself with that  mademoiselle may repose  herself here as on the bosom of the mother of mademoiselle      betty had her dejeuner on the little stone terrace with rickety rustic  railings  below lay the garden  thick with trees     away among the trees to the left an arbour  she saw through the leaves  the milk white gleam of flannels  heard the chink of china and  cutlery  there  no doubt  the mad englishman was even now  breakfasting  there was the width of the garden between them  she sat  still till the flannel gleam had gone away among the trees  then she  went out and explored the little town  she bought a blue packet of  cigarettes  miss voscoe had often tried to persuade her to smoke  most  of the girls did  betty had not wanted to do it any more for that  she  had had a feeling that vernon would not like her to smoke     and in paris one had to be careful  but now       i am absolutely my own master   she said   i am staying by myself at  a hotel  exactly like a man  i shall feel more at home if i smoke  and  besides  no one can see me  it s just for me  and it shows i don t  care what  he  likes      lying in a long chair reading one of her tauchnitz books and smoking   betty felt very manly indeed     the long afternoon wore on  the trees of the garden crowded round  betty with soft whispers in a language not known of the trees on the  boulevards      i am very very unhappy   said betty with a deep sigh of delight     she went in  unpacked  arranged everything neatly  she always arranged  everything neatly  but nothing ever would stay arranged  she wrote to  her father  explaining that madame gautier had brought her and the  other girls to grez for the summer  and she gave as her address     chez madame chevillon  pavilion du jardin  grez      i shall be very very unhappy to morrow   said betty that night   laying her face against the coarse cool linen of her pillow   to day i  have been stunned   i haven t been able to feel anything  but  to morrow      to morrow  she knew  would be golden and green even as to day  but she  should not care  she did not want to be happy  how could she be happy  now that she had of her own free will put away the love of her life   she called and beckoned to all the thoughts that the green world shut  out  and they came at her call  fluttering black wings to hide the  sights and sounds of field and wood and green garden  and making their  nest in her heart      yes   she said  turning the hot rough pillow   now it begins to hurt  again  i knew it would      it hurt more than she had meant it to hurt  when she beckoned those  black winged thoughts  it hurt so much that she could not sleep  she  got up and leaned from the window     she wondered where vernon was  it was quite early  not eleven  lady  st  craye had called that quite early      he s with  her   of course   said betty   sitting at her feet  no  doubt  and looking up at her hateful eyes  and holding her horrid  hand  and forgetting that he ever knew a girl named me      betty dressed and went out     she crossed the garden  it was very dark among the trees  it would be  lighter in the road     the big yard door was ajar  she pushed it softly  it creaked and let  her through into the silent street  there were no lights in the hotel   no lights in any of the houses     she stood a moment  hesitating  a door creaked inside the hotel  she  took the road to the river      i wonder if people ever  do  drown themselves for love   said betty    he d be sorry then            chapter xxii       the lunatic     the night kept its promise  betty  slipping from the sleeping house  into the quiet darkness  seemed to slip into a poppy fringed pool of  oblivion  the night laid fresh  cold hands on her tired eyes  and shut  out many things  she paused for a minute on the bridge to listen to  the restful restless whisper of the water against the rough stone     her eyes growing used to the darkness discerned the white ribbon of  road unrolling before her  the trees were growing thicker  this must  be the forest  certainly it was the forest      how dark it is   she said   how dear and dark  and how still  i  suppose the trams are running just the same along the boulevard  montparnasse   and all the lights and people  and the noise  and i ve  been there all these months  and all the time this was here  this      paris was going on  all that muddle and maze of worried people  and  she was out of it all  here  alone     alone  a quick terror struck at the heart of her content  an abrupt  horrible certainty froze her  the certainty that she was not alone   there was some living thing besides herself in the forest  quite near  her  something other than the deer and the squirrels and the quiet  dainty woodland people  she felt it in every fibre long before she  heard that faint light sound that was not one of the forest noises   she stood still and listened     she had never been frightened of the dark  of the outdoor dark  at  long barton she had never been afraid even to go past the church yard  in the dark night  the free night that had never held any terrors   only dreams     but now  she quickened her pace  and  yes  footsteps came on behind  her  and in front the long straight ribbon of the road unwound  gray  now in the shadow  there seemed to be no road turning to right or  left  she could not go on forever  she would have to turn   sometime  if not now  yet sometime  in this black darkness  and then  she would meet this thing that trod so softly  so stealthily behind  her     before she knew that she had ceased to walk  she was crouched in the  black between two bushes  she had leapt as the deer leaps  and  crouched  still as any deer     her dark blue linen gown was one with the forest shadows  she breathed  noiselessly  her eyes were turned to the gray ribbon of road that had  been behind her  she had heard  now she would see     she did see  something white and tall and straight  oh  the relief of  the tallness and straightness and whiteness  she had thought of  something dwarfed and clumsy  dark  misshapen  slouching beast like on  two shapeless feet  why were people afraid of tall white ghosts     it passed  it was a man  in a white suit  just an ordinary man  no   not ordinary  the ordinary man in france does not wear white  nor in  england  except for boating and tennis and      flannels  yes  the lunatic who boiled his brains in the sun     betty s terror changed colour as the wave changes from green to white   but it lost not even so much of its force as the wave loses by the  change  it held her moveless till the soft step of the tennis shoes  died away  then softly and hardly moving at all  moving so little that  not a leaf of those friendly bushes rustled  she slipped off her  shoes  took them in her hand  made one leap through the crackling   protesting undergrowth and fled back along the road  fleet as a  greyhound     she ran and she walked  very fast  and then she ran again and never  once did she pause to look or listen  if the lunatic caught her  well   he would catch her  but it should not be  her  fault if he did     the trees were thinner  ahead she saw glimpses of a world that looked  quite light  the bridge ahead  with one last spurt she ran across it   tore up the little bit of street  slipped through the door  and  between the garden trees to her pavilion     she looked very carefully in every corner  all was still and empty   she locked the door  and fell face downward on her bed     vernon in his studio was  thinking things over  after the advice of  miss voscoe in much the same attitude      oh   said betty   i will never go out at night again  and i will  leave this horrible  horrible place the very first thing to morrow  morning      but to morrow morning touched the night s events with new colours from  its shining palette      after all  even a lunatic has a right to walk out in the forest if it  wants to   she told herself   and it didn t know i was there  i  expect  really  but i think i ll go and stay at some other hotel      she asked  when her  complete coffee  came to her  what the mad  gentleman did all day      he is not so stupid as mademoiselle supposes   said marie   all the  artists are insane  and he  he is only a little more insane than the  others  he is not a real mad  all the same  see you  to day he makes  drawings at montigny       which way is montigny   asked betty  and  learning  strolled  when  her coffee was finished  by what looked like the other way     it took her to the river      it s like the medway   said betty  stooping to the fat cowslips at  her feet   only prettier  and i never saw any cowslips here  you  dears      betty would not look at her sorrow in this gay  glad world  but she  knew at last what her sorrow s name was  she saw now that it was love  that had stood all the winter between her and vernon  holding a hand  of each  in her blindness she had called it friendship   but now she  knew its real  royal name     she felt that her heart was broken  even the fact that her grief was a  thing to be indulged or denied at will brought her no doubts  she had  always wanted to be brave and noble  well  now she was being both     a turn of the river brought to sight a wide reach dotted with green  islands  each a tiny forest of willow saplings and young alders     there was a boat moored under an aspen  a great clumsy boat  but it  had sculls in it  it would be pleasant to go out to the islands     she got into the boat  loosened the heavy rattling chain and flung it  in board  took up the sculls and began to pull  it was easy work      i didn t know i was such a good oar   said betty as the boat crept  swiftly down the river     as she stepped into the boat  she noticed the long river reeds  straining down stream like the green hair of hidden water nixies     she would land at the big island  the boat steered easily and lightly  enough for all its size  but before she could ship her oars and grasp  at a willow root she shot past the island     then she remembered the streaming green weeds      why  there must be a frightful current   she said  what could make  the river run at this pace  a weir  or a waterfall     she turned the boat s nose up stream and pulled  ah  this was work   then her eyes  fixed in the exertion of pulling  found that they saw  no moving banks  but just one picture  a willow  a clump of irises   three poplars in the distance  and the foreground of the picture did  not move  all her pulling only sufficed to keep the boat from going  with the stream  and now  as the effort relaxed a little it did not  even do this  the foreground did move  the wrong way  the boat was  slipping slowly down stream  she turned and made for the bank  but the  stream caught her broadside on  whirled the boat round and swept it  calmly and gently down  towards the weir  or the waterfall     betty pulled two strong strokes  driving the boat s nose straight for  the nearest island  shipped the sculls with a jerk  stumbled forward  and caught at an alder stump  she flung the chain round it and made  fast  the boat s stern swung round  it was thrust in under the bank  and held there close  the chain clicked loudly as it stretched taut      well   said betty  the island was between her and the riverside path   no one would be able to see her  she must listen and call out when she  heard anyone pass  then they would get another boat and come and fetch  her away  she would not tempt fate again alone in that boat  she was  not going to be drowned in any silly french river     she landed  pushed through the saplings  found a mossy willow stump  and sat down to get her breath     it was very hot on the island  it smelt damply of wet lily leaves and  iris roots and mud  flies buzzed and worried  the time was very long   and no one came by      i may have to spend the day here   she told herself   it s not so  safe in the boat  but it s not so fly y either      and still no one passed     suddenly the soft whistling of a tune came through the hot air  a tune  she had learned in paris       c etait deux amants        hi   cried betty in a voice that was not at all like her voice    help    au secours    she added on second thoughts      where are you   came a voice  how alike all englishmen s voices  seemed  in a foreign land      here  on the island  send someone out with a boat  will you  i can t  work my boat a bit      through the twittering leaves she saw something white waving  next  moment a big splash  she could see  through a little gap  a white  blazer thrown down on the bank  a pair of sprawling brown boots  in  the water a sleek wet round head  an arm in a blue shirt sleeve  swimming a strong side stroke  it was the lunatic  of course it was   and she had called to him  and he was coming  she pushed back to the  boat  leaped in  and was fumbling with the chain when she heard the  splash and the crack of broken twigs that marked the lunatic s  landing     she would rather chance the weir or the waterfall than be alone on  that island with a maniac  but the chain was stretched straight and  stiff as a lance   she could not untwist it  she was still struggling   with pink fingers bruised and rust stained  when something heavy  crashed through the saplings and a voice cried close to her      drop it  what are you doing    and a hand fell on the chain     betty  at bay  raised her head  lunatics  she knew  could be quelled  by the calm gaze of the sane human eye     she gave one look  and held out both hands with a joyous cry      oh   it s  you   i  am  so glad  where did you come from  oh  how wet  you are      then she sat down on the thwart and said no more  because of the  choking feeling in her throat that told her very exactly just how  frightened she had been      you   temple was saying very slowly   how on earth  where are you  staying  where s your party      he was squeezing the water out of sleeves and trouser legs      i haven t got a party  i m staying alone at a hotel  just like a man   i know you re frightfully shocked  you always are       where are you staying   he asked  drawing the chain in hand over  hand  till a loose loop of it dipped in the water      hotel chevillon  how dripping you are       hotel chevillon   he repeated   never  then it was  you        what was me       that i was sheep dog to last night in the forest       then it was  you   and i thought it was the lunatic  oh  if i d only  known  but why did you come after me  if you didn t know it  was  me      temple blushed through the runnels of water that trickled from his  hair      i  well  madame told me there was an english girl staying at the  hotel  and i heard some one go out  and i looked out of the window and  i thought it was the girl  and i just  well  if anything had gone  wrong  a drunken man  or anything  it was just as well there should be  someone there  don t you know       that s very  very nice of you   said betty   but oh    she told him  about the lunatic      oh  that s me   said temple   i recognise the portrait  especially  about the hat      he had loosened the chain and was pulling with strong even strokes  across the river towards the bank where his coat lay      we ll land here if you don t mind       can t you pull up to the place where i stole the boat      he laughed      the man s not living who could pull against this stream when the  mill s going and the lower sluice gates are open  how glad i am that  i  and how plucky and splendid of you not to lose your head  but just  to hang on  it takes a lot of courage to wait  doesn t it      betty thought it did      let me carry your coat   said betty as they landed   you ll make it  so wet      he stood still a moment and looked at her      now we re on terra cotta   he said   let me remind you that we ve not  shaken hands  oh  but it s good to see you again                                                   look well  my child   said madame chevillon   and when you see  approach the meess  warn me  that i may make the little omelette at  the instant       oh  la  la  madame   cried marie five minutes later   here it is that  she comes  and the mad with her  he talks with her  in laughing  she  carries his coat  and neither the one nor the other has any hat       i will make a double omelette   said madame   give me still more of  the eggs  the english are all mad  the one like the other  but even  mads must eat  my child  is it not            chapter xxiii       temperatures      it isn t as though she were the sort of girl who can t take care of  herself   said lady st  craye to the inward monitor who was buzzing its  indiscreet common places in her ear   i ve really done her a good turn  by sending her to grez  no  it s not in the least compromising for a  girl to stay at the same hotel  and besides  there are lots of amusing  people there  i expect  she ll have a delightful time  and get to know  that temple boy really well  i m sure he d repay investigation  if i  weren t a besotted fool i could have pursued those researches myself   but it s not what s worth having that one wants  it s  it s what one   does  want  yes  that s all      paris was growing intolerable  but for  well  a thousand reasons  lady  st  craye would already have left it  the pavements were red hot  when  one drove it was through an air like the breath from the open mouth of  a furnace     she kept much within doors  filled her rooms with roses  and lived  with every window open  her balcony  too  was full of flowers  and the  striped sun blinds beyond each open window kept the rooms in pleasant  shadow      but suppose something happens to her  all alone there   said the  inward monitor      nothing will  she s not that sort of girl   her headache had been  growing worse these three days  the inward monitor might have had  pity  remembering that  but no      you told him that all girls were the same sort of girls   said the  pitiless voice      i didn t mean in that way  i suppose you d have liked me to write  that anonymous letter and restore her to the bosom of her furious  family  i ve done the girl a good turn  for what she did for me  she s  a good little thing  too good for him  even if i didn t happen to  and  temple s her ideal mate  i wonder if he s found it out yet  he must  have by now  three weeks in the same hotel      temple  however  was not in the same hotel  the very day of the river  rescue and the double omelette he had moved his traps a couple of  miles down the river to montigny     a couple of miles is a good distance  also a very little way  as you  choose to take it      you know it was a mean trick   said the inward monitor   why not have  let the girl go away where she could be alone  and get over it       oh  be quiet   said lady st  craye   i never knew myself so tiresome  before  i think i must be going to be ill  my head feels like an ice  in an omelette      vernon  strolling in much later  found her with eyes closed  leaning  back among her flowers as she had lain all that long afternoon      how pale you look   he said   you ought to get away from here       yes   she said   i suppose i ought  it would be easier for you if you  hadn t the awful responsibility of bringing me roses every other day   what beauty darlings these are   she dipped her face in the fresh pure  whiteness of the ones he had laid on her knee  their faces felt cold   like the faces of dead people  she shivered      heaven knows what i should do without you to  to bring my  my roses  to   he said      do you bring me anything else to day   she roused herself to ask    any news  for instance       no   he said   there isn t any news  there never will be  she s gone  home  i m certain of it  next week i shall go over to england and  propose for her formally to her step father       a very proper course      it was odd that talking to some one else should make one s head throb  like this  and it was so difficult to know what to say  very odd  it  had been much easier to talk to the inward monitor     she made herself say   and suppose she isn t there   she thought she  said it rather well      well  then there s no harm done       he doesn t like you   she was glad she had remembered that      he didn t  but the one little word  marriage   simply spoken  is a  magic spell for taming savage relatives  they ll eat out of your hand  after that  at least so i m told      it was awful that he should decide to do this  heart breaking  but it  did not seem to be hurting her heart  that felt as though it wasn t  there  could one feel emotion in one s hands and feet  hers were ice  cold  but inside they tingled and glowed  like a worm of fire in a  chrysalis of ice  what a silly simile      must you go   was what she found herself saying   suppose she isn t  there at all  you ll simply be giving her away  all her secret  and  he ll fetch her home      that at least was quite clearly put      i m certain she is at home   he said   and i don t see why i am  waiting till next week  i ll go to morrow      if you are pulling a rose to pieces it is very important to lay the  petals in even rows on your lap  especially if the rose be white      eustace   she said  suddenly feeling quite coherent   i wish you  wouldn t go away from paris just now  i don t believe you d find her   i have a feeling that she s not far away  i think that is quite  sensible  i am not saying it because i  and  i feel very ill  eustace   i think i am  oh  i am going  to be ill  very ill  i think  won t you  wait a little  you ll have such years and years to be happy in  i  don t want to be ill here in paris with no one to care      she was leaning forward  her hands on the arms of her chair  and for  the first time that day  he saw her face plainly  he said   i shall go  out now  and wire for your sister       not for worlds  i forbid it  she d drive me mad  no  but my head s  running round like a beetle on a pin  i think you d better go now  but  don t go to morrow  i mean i think i ll go to sleep  i feel as if i d  tumbled off the eiffel tower and been caught on a cloud  one side of  it s cold and the other s blazing      he took her hand  felt her pulse  then he kissed the hand      my dear  tired jasmine lady   he said   i ll send in a doctor  and  don t worry  i won t go to morrow  i ll write       oh  very well   she said   write then   and it will all come  out  about her being here alone  and she ll always hate you   i  don t  care what you do       i suppose i can write a letter as though  as though i d not seen her  since long barton   he inwardly thanked her for that hint      a letter written from paris  that s so likely  isn t it  but do what  you like   i  don t care what you do      she was faintly  agreeably surprised to notice that she was speaking  the truth   it s rather pleasant  do you know   she went on dreamily    when everything that matters suddenly goes flat  and you wonder what  on earth you ever worried about  why do people always talk about cold  shivers  i think hot shivers are much more amusing  it s like a  skylark singing up close to the sun  and doing the tremolo with its  wings  i m sorry you re going away  though       i m not going away   he said   i wouldn t leave you when you re ill  for all the life s happinesses that ever were  oh  why can t you cure  me  i don t want to want her  i want to want you       i m certain   said lady st  craye brightly   that what you ve just  been saying s most awfully interesting  but i like to hear things said  ever so many times  then the seventh time you understand everything   and the coldness and the hotness turn into silver and gold and  everything is quite beautiful  and i think i am not saying exactly  what you expected   don t think i don t know that what i say sounds  like nonsense  i know that quite well  only i can t stop talking  you  know one is like that sometimes  it was like that the night you hit  me       i   hit you       he was kneeling by her low chair holding her hand  as she lay back  talking quickly in low  even tones  her golden eyes shining  wonderfully      no  you didn t call it hitting  but things aren t always what we call  them  are they  you mustn t kiss me now  eustace  i think i ve got  some horrid fever  i m sure i have  because of course nobody could be  bewitched nowadays  and put into a body that feels thick and thin in  the wrong places  and my head  isn t  too big to get through the  door   of course i know it isn t  it would be funny if it were  i do  love funny things   so do you  i like to hear you laugh  i wish i  could say something funny  so as to hear you laugh now      she was holding his hand very tightly with one of hers  the other held  the white roses  all her mind braced itself to a great exertion as the  muscles do for a needed effort  she spoke very slowly      listen  eustace  i am going to be ill  get a nurse and a doctor and  go away  perhaps it is catching  and if i fall through the floor   she  added laughing   it is so hard to stop       put your arms round my neck   he said  for she had risen and was  swaying like a flame in the wind  the white rose leaves fell in  showers      i don t think i want to  now   she said  astonished that it should be  so      oh  yes  you do    he spoke as one speaks to a child   put your arms  round eustace s neck   your own eustace that s so fond of you       are you   she said  and her arms fell across his shoulders      of course i am   he said   hold tight      he lifted her and carried her  not quite steadily  for carrying a  full grown woman is not the bagatelle novelists would have us believe  it     he opened her bedroom door  laid her on the white  lacy coverlet of  her bed      now   he said   you are to lie quite still  you ve been so good and  dear and unselfish  you ve always done everything i ve asked  even  difficult things  this is quite easy  just lie and think about me till  i come back      he bent over the bed and kissed her gently      ah   she sighed  there was a flacon on the table by the bed  he  expected it to be jasmine  it was lavender water  he drenched her hair  and brow and hands      that s nice   said she   i m not really ill  i think it s nice to be  ill  quite still do you mean  like that      she folded her hands  the white roses still clasped  the white bed   the white dress  the white flowers  horrible      yes   he said firmly   just like that  i shall be back in five  minutes      he was not gone three  he came back and  till the doctor came   summoned by the concierge  he sat by her  holding her hands  covering  her with furs from the wardrobe when she shivered  bathing her wrists  with perfumed water when she threw off the furs and spoke of the fire  that burned in her secret heart of cold clouds     when the doctor came he went out by that excellent irishman s  direction and telegraphed for a nurse     then he waited in the cool shaded sitting room  among the flowers   this was where he had hit her  as she said  there on the divan she had  cried  leaning her head against his sleeve  here  half way to the  door  they had kissed each other  no  he would certainly not go to  england while she was ill  he felt sufficiently like a murderer  already  but he would write  he glanced at her writing table     a little pang pricked him  and drove him to the balcony      no   he said   if we are to hit people  at least let us hit them  fairly   but all the same he found himself playing with the  word puzzle whose solution was the absolutely right letter to betty s  father  asking her hand in marriage      well   he asked the doctor who closed softly the door of the bedroom  and came forward   is it brain fever       holy ann  no  brain fever s a fell disease invented by novelists  i  never met it in all  my  experience  the doctors in novels have  special advantages  no  it s influenza  pretty severe touch too  she  ought to have been in bed days ago  she ll want careful looking  after       i see   said vernon   any danger       there s always danger  lord  saint croix isn t it       i have not the honour to be lady st  craye s husband   said vernon  equably   i was merely calling  and she seemed so ill that i took upon  myself to        i see  i see  well  if you don t mind taking on yourself to let her  husband know  it s a nasty case  temperature      perhaps her husband   ud be as well here as anywhere       he s dead   said vernon      oh   said the doctor with careful absence of expression   get some  woman to put her to bed and to stay with her till the nurse comes   she s in a very excitable state  good afternoon  i ll look in after  dinner      when vernon had won the concierge to the desired service  had seen the  nurse installed  had dined  called for news of lady st  craye  learned  that she was   toujours tres souffrante    he went home  pulled a  table into the middle of his large  bare  hot studio  and sat down to  write to the reverend cecil underwood      i mean to do it   he told himself   and it can t hurt  her  my doing  it now instead of a month ahead  when she s well again  in fact  it s  better for all of us to get it settled one way or another while she s  not caring about anything      so he wrote  and he wrote a great deal  though the letter that at last  he signed was quite short       my dear sir       i have the honour to ask the hand of your daughter in marriage  when    you asked me  most properly  my intentions  i told you that i was    betrothed to another lady  this is not now the case  and i have    found myself wholly unable to forget the impression made upon me    last year by miss desmond  my income is about l      a year  and    increases yearly  i beg to apologise for anything which may have    annoyed you in my conduct last year  and to assure you that my    esteem and affection for miss desmond are lasting and profound  and    that  should she do me the honour to accept my proposal  i shall    devote my life s efforts to secure her happiness       i am  my dear sir  your obedient servant       eustace vernon      that ought to do the trick   he told himself   talk of old world  courtesy and ceremonial  anyhow  i shall know whether she s at long  barton by the time it takes to get an answer  if it s two days  she s  there  if it s longer she isn t  he ll send my letter on to  her  unless he suppresses it  your really pious people are so  shockingly unscrupulous      there is nothing so irretrievable as a posted letter  this came home  to vernon as the envelope dropped on the others in the box at the cafe  du dome  came home to him rather forlornly     next morning he called with more roses for lady st  craye  pinky ones  this time      milady was toujours  tres souffrante   it would be ten days  at the  least  before milady could receive  even a very old friend  like  monsieur      the letter reached long barton between the guardian and a catalogue of  some rare books  the reverend cecil read it four times  he was trying  to be just  at first he thought he would write  no  and tell betty  years later  but the young man had seen the error of his ways  and  l      a year       the surprise visit with which the reverend cecil had always intended  to charm his step daughter suddenly found its date quite definitely  fixed  this could not be written  he must go to the child and break it  to her very gently  very tenderly  find out quite delicately and  cleverly exactly what her real feelings were  girls were so shy about  those things     miss julia desmond had wired him from suez that she would be in paris  next week  had astonishingly asked him to meet her there      paris next tuesday gare st  lazare       come and see betty via  dieppe   had been her odd message     he had not meant to go  not next tuesday  he was afraid of miss julia  desmond  he would rather have his lizzie all to himself  but now      he wrote a cablegram to miss julia desmond   care captain s s  urania   brindisi  will meet you in paris   then he thought that this might  seem to the telegraph people not quite nice  so he changed it to    going to see lizzie tuesday      the fates that had slept so long were indeed waking up and beginning  to take notice of betty  destiny  like the most attractive of the  porters at the gare de lyon    s occupait d elle             chapter xxiv       the confessional     the concierge sat at her window under the arch of the porte cochere at     boulevard montparnasse  she sat gazing across its black shade to  the sunny street  she was thinking  the last twenty four hours had  given food for thought     the trams passed and repassed  people in carriages  people on  foot  the usual crowd  not interesting     but the open carriage suddenly drawn up at the other side of the broad  pavement was interesting  very  for it contained the lady who had  given the     francs  and had promised another fifty on the first of  the month  she had never come with that fifty  and the concierge  having given up all hope of seeing her again  had acted accordingly     lady st  craye  pale as the laces of her sea green cambric gown  came  slowly up the cobble paved way and halted at the window      good morning  madame   she said   i bring you the little present      the concierge was genuinely annoyed  why had she not waited a little  longer  still  all was not yet lost      come in  madame   she said   madame has the air very fatigued       i have been very ill   said lady st  craye      if madame will give herself the trouble to go round by the other  door    the concierge went round and met her visitor in the hall  and  brought her into the closely furnished little room with the high  wooden bed  the round table  the rack for letters  and the big lamp      will madame give herself the trouble to sit down  would it be  permitted to offer madame something  a little glass of sugared water   no  i regret infinitely not having known that madame was suffering  i  should have acted otherwise       what have you done   she asked quickly   you haven t told anyone that  i was here that night       do not believe it for an instant   said the woman reassuringly     no  after madame s goodness i held myself wholly at the disposition  of madame  but when the day appointed passed itself without your  visit  i said to myself   the little affaire has ceased to interest  this lady  she is weary of it   my grateful heart found itself free to  acknowledge the kindness of others       tell me exactly   said lady st  craye   what you have done       it was but last week   the concierge went on  rearranging a stiff  bouquet in exactly the manner of an embarrassed ingenue on the stage    but only last week that i received a letter from mademoiselle  desmond  she sent me her address      she paused  lady st  craye laid the bank note on the table      madame wants the address       i have the address  i want to know whether you have given it to  anyone else       no  madame   said the concierge with simple pride   when you have  given a thing you have it not any longer       well  pardon me  have you sold it       for the same good reason  no  madame       take the note   said lady st  craye   and tell me what you have done  with the address       this gentleman  whom madame did not wish to know that she had been  here that night        i didn t wish  anyone  to know       perfectly  this gentleman comes without ceasing to ask of me news of  mademoiselle desmond  and always i have no news  but when mademoiselle  writes me   i am at the hotel such and such  send to me  i pray you   letters if there are any of them    then when monsieur makes his  eternal demand i reply   i have now the address of mademoiselle   not  to give  but to send her letters  if monsieur had the idea to cause to  be expedited a little billet  i am all at the service of monsieur        so he wrote to her  have you sent on the letter       alas  yes   replied the concierge with heartfelt regret   i kept it  during a week  hoping always to see madame  but yesterday  even  i put  it at the post  otherwise     i beg madame to have the goodness to  understand that i attach myself entirely to her interests  you may  rely on me       it is useless   said lady st  craye   the affair  is  ceasing to  interest me       do not say that  wait only a little till you have heard  it is not  only monsieur that occupies himself with mademoiselle  last night  arrives an aunt  also a father  they ask for mademoiselle  are  consternated when they learn of her departing  they run all paris at  the research of her  the father lodges at the haute loire  he is a  priest it appears  madame the aunt occupies the ancient apartment of  mademoiselle desmond       an instant   said lady st  craye   let me reflect      the concierge ostentatiously went back to her flowers      you have not given  them  miss desmond s address       madame forgets   said the concierge  wounded virtue bristling in her  voice   that i was  for the moment  devoted to the interest of  monsieur  no  i am a loyal soul  i have told  nothing   only to  despatch the letter  behold all       i will give myself the pleasure of offering you a little present next  week   said lady st  craye   it is only that you should say  nothing  nothing  and send no more letters  and  the address       madame knows it  by what she says       yes  but i want to know if the address you have is the same that i  have  hotel chevillon  grez sur loing  is it so       it is exact  i thank you  madame  madame would do well to return   chez elle  and to repose herself a little  madame is all pale       is the aunt in miss desmond s rooms now       yes  she writes letters without end  and telegrams  and the  priest father he runs with them like a sad old black dog that has not  the habit of towns       i shall go up and see her   said lady st  craye   and i shall most  likely give her the address  but do not give yourself anxiety  you  will gain more by me than by any of the others  they are not rich  me   i am  heaven be praised      she went out and along the courtyard  at the foot of the wide shallow  stairs she paused and leaned on the dusty banisters      i feel as weak as any rat   she said   but i must go through with  it  i must      she climbed the stairs  and stood outside the brown door  the nails  that had held the little card  miss e  desmond  still stuck there  but  only four corners of the card remained     the door was not shut  it always shut unwillingly  she tapped      come in   said a clear  pleasant voice  and she went in     the room was not as she had seen it on the two occasions when it had  been the battle ground where she and betty fought for a man  plaid  travelling rugs covered the divans  a gold faced watch in a leather  bracelet ticked on the table among scattered stationery  a lady in a  short sensible dress rose from the table  and the room was scented  with the smell of hungarian cigarettes      i beg your pardon  i thought it was my brother in law  did you call  to see miss desmond  she is away for a short time       yes   said lady st  craye   i know  i wanted to see you  the  concierge told me        oh  these concierges  they tell everything  it s what they were  invented for  i believe  and you wanted    she stopped  looked hard at  the young woman and went on   what you want is a good stiff brandy and  soda  here  where s the head of the pin   i always think it such a  pity bonnets went out  one could undo strings  that s it  now  put  your feet up  that s right  i ll be back in half a minute      lady st  craye found herself lying at full length on betty s divan   her feet covered with a tussore driving rug  her violet wreathed hat  on a table at some distance     she closed her eyes  it was just as well  she could get back a little  strength  she could try to arrange coherently what she meant to say   no  it was not unfair to the girl  she ought to be taken care of  and   besides  there was no such thing as  unfair   all was fair in  well   she was righting for her life  all was fair when one was fighting for  one s life  that was what she meant  meantime  to lie quite still and  draw long  even breaths  telling oneself at each breath   i am quite  well  i am quite strong    seemed best     there was a sound  a dull plop  the hiss and fizzle of a spurting  syphon  then      drink this  that s right  i ve got you      a strong arm round her shoulders  something buzzing and spitting in a  glass under her nose      drink it up  there s a good child      she drank  a long breath      now the rest   she was obedient      now shut your eyes and don t bother  when you re better we ll talk      silence  save for the fierce scratching of a pen      i m better   announced lady st  craye as the pen paused for the  folding of the third letter     the short skirted woman came and sat on the edge of the divan  very  upright      well then  you oughtn t to be out  you poor little thing      the words brought the tears to the eyes of one weak with the  self pitying weakness of convalescence      i wanted        are you a friend of betty s       yes  no  i don t know       a hated rival perhaps   said the elder woman cheerfully   you didn t  come to do her a good turn  anyhow  did you       i  i don t know   again this was all that would come      i do  though  well  which of us is to begin  you see  child  the  difficulty is that we neither of us know how much the other knows and  we don t want to give ourselves away  it s so awkward to talk when  it s like that       i think i know more than you do  i  you needn t think i want to hurt  her  i should have liked her awfully  if it hadn t been        if it hadn t been for the man  yes  i see  who was he      lady st  craye felt absolutely defenceless  besides  what did it  matter      mr  vernon   she said      ah  now we re getting to the horses  my dear child  don t look so  guilty  you re not the first  you won t be the last  especially with  eyes the colour his are  and so you hate betty       no  i don t  i should like to tell you all about it  all the truth       you can t   said miss desmond   no woman can  but i ll give you  credit for trying to  if you ll go straight ahead  but first of  all  how long is it since you saw her       nearly a month       well  she s disappeared  her father and i got here last night  she s  gone away and left no address  she was living with a madame gautier  and        madame gautier died last october   said lady st  craye   the  twenty fifth       i had a letter from her brother  it got me in bombay  but i couldn t  believe it  and who has betty been living with       look here   said lady st  craye   i came to give the whole thing  away  and hand her over to you  i know where she is  but now i don t  want to  her father s a brute  i know       not he   said miss desmond   he s only a man and a very  very silly  one  i ll pledge you my word he ll never approach her  whatever she s  done  it s not anything too awful for words  i m certain  come  tell  me      lady st  craye told betty s secret at some length      did she tell you this       no       he did then       yes       oh  men are darlings  the soul of honour  unsullied blades  my word   do you mind if i smoke      she lighted a cigarette      i suppose  i m  very dishonourable too   said lady st  craye      you  oh no  you re only a woman   and then       well  at last i asked her to go away  and she went       well  that was decent of her  wasn t it       yes       and now you re going to tell me where she is and i m to take her home  and keep her out of his way  is that it       i don t know   said lady st  craye very truly   why i came to you at  all  because it s all no good  he s written and proposed for her to  her father  and if she cares        well  if she cares  and he cares  do you really mean that  you d   care to marry a man who s in love with another woman       i d marry him if he was in love with fifty other women       in that case   said miss desmond   i should say you were the very  wife for him        she  isn t   said lady st  craye sitting up   i feel like a silly  school girl talking to you like this  i think i ll go now  i m not  really so silly as i seem  i ve been ill  influenza  you know  and i  got so frightfully tired  and i don t think i m so strong as i used to  be  i ve always thought i was strong enough to play any part i wanted  to play  but  you ve been very kind  i ll go    she lay back      don t be silly   said miss desmond briskly   you  are  a school girl  compared with me  you know  i suppose you ve been trying to play the  role of the designing heroine  to part true lovers and so on  and then  you found you couldn t       they re  not  true lovers   said lady st  craye eagerly   that s just  it  she d never make him happy  she s too young and too innocent  and  when she found out what a man like him is like  she d break her heart   and he told me he d be happier with me than he ever had been with  her       was that true  or         oh  yes  it was true enough  though he said it  you ve met him  he  told me  but you don t know him       i know his kind though   said miss desmond   and so you love him very  much indeed  and you don t care for anything else   and you think you  understand him   and you could forgive him everything  then you may  get him yet  if you care so very much  that is  if betty doesn t       she doesn t  she thinks she does  but she doesn t  if only he hadn t  written to her        my dear   said miss desmond   i was a fool myself once  about a man  with eyes his colour  you can t tell me anything that i don t know   does he know how much you care       yes       ah  that s a pity  still  well  is there anything else you want to  tell me       i don t want to tell anyone anything  only  when she said she d go  away  i advised her where to go  and i told her of a quiet place  and  mr  temple s there  he s the other man who admires her       i see  how machiavelian of you    miss desmond touched the younger  woman s hand with brusque gentleness   and         and i didn t quite tell her the truth about mr  vernon and me   said  lady st  craye  wallowing in the abject joys of the confessional   and  i am a beast and not fit to live  but   she added with the true  penitent s instinct of self defence   i  know  it s only  oh  i don t  know what  not love  with her  and it s my life       yes  and what about him       it s not love with him  at least it is  but she d bore him  it s  really his waking up time  he s been playing the game just for  counters all the while  now he s learning to play with gold       and it ll stay learnt  i see   said miss desmond   look here  i like  you  i know we shouldn t have said all we have if you weren t ill  and  i weren t anxious  but i m with you in one thing  i don t want him to  marry betty  she wouldn t understand an artist in emotion  is this  temple straight       as a yardstick       and as wooden  well  that s better  i m on your side  but  we ve been  talking without the veils on  tell me one thing  are you sure you  could get him if betty were out of the way       he kissed me once  since he s loved her   said lady st  craye   and  then i knew i could  he liked me better than he liked her  in all the  other ways  before  i m a shameless idiot  it s really only because  i m so feeble      she rose and stood before the glass  putting on her hat      i do respect a woman who has the courage to speak the truth to  another woman   said miss desmond   i hope you ll get him  though it s  not a very kind wish      lady st  craye let herself go completely in a phrase whose memory  stung and rankled for many a long day      ah   she said   even if he gets tired of me  i shall have got his  children  you don t know what it is to want a child  good bye       good bye   said miss desmond   no  of course i don t            chapter xxv       the forest     nothing lifts the heart like the sense of a great self sacrifice nobly  made  betty was glad that she could feel so particularly noble  it was  a great help      he was mine   she told herself   he meant to be  and i have given him  up to her  it hurts  yes  but i did the right thing      she thought she hoped that he would soon forget her  and almost all  that was betty tried quite sincerely  snatching at every help  to  forget him     sometimes the betty that betty did not want to be would  quite  deliberately and of set purpose  take out the nest of hungry memories   look at them  play with them  and hand over her heart for them to feed  on  but always when she had done this she felt  afterwards  a little  sorry  a little ashamed  it was too like the diary at long barton     consciously or unconsciously one must make some concessions to every  situation or every situation would be impossible  temple was  here  interested  pleased to see her  glad to talk to her  but he was  not at all inclined to be in love with her  that had been only a silly  fancy of hers  in paris  he had made up his mind by now who it was  that he cared for  and it wasn t betty  probably she hadn t even been  one of the two he came to grez to think about  he was only a good  friend  and she wanted a good friend  if he were not just a good  friend the situation would be impossible  and betty chose that the  situation should be possible  for it was pleasant  it was a shield and  a shelter from all the thoughts that she wanted to hide from      if she thinks i m going to break my heart about  him   she s  mistaken  and so s he  i must be miserable for a bit   said betty  bravely   but i ll not be miserable forever  so he needn t think it   of course  i shall never care for anyone ever again  unless he were to  love me for years and years before he ever said a word  and then i  might say i would try    and  try  but fall in love   never again  oh   good gracious  there he is   and i ve not  begun  to get ready      temple was whistling  deux amants  very softly in the courtyard below   she put her head out of the window      i shan t be two minutes   she said   you might get the basket from  madame  and my sketching things are on the terrace all ready strapped  up      the hoofs of the smart gray pony slipped and rattled on the  cobble stones of the hotel entry      au revoir  amuse yourselves well  my children   madame chevillon  stood  one hand on fat hip  the other shading old eyes that they might  watch the progress of the cart up the blinding whiteness of the  village street      to the forest  and yet again to the forest and to the forest always    she said  turning into the darkened billiard room   marie  beware   thou  of the forest  the good god created it express for the  lovers   but it is permitted to the devil to promenade himself there  also       those two there   said marie   it is very certain that they are in  love       how otherwise   said madame   the good god made us women that the men  should be in love with us  and afterwards  to take care of the  children  there is no other use that a man has for a woman   friendship  the art   bah  when a man wants those he demands them of a  man  of a woman he demands but love  and one gives it to him  one  gives it to him without question      the two who had departed for the forest drove on through the swimming   spinning heat  in silence     it was not till they reached the little old well by marlotte that  betty spoke      don t let s work to day  mr  temple   she said   my hands are so hot  i could never hold a brush  and your sketch is really finished  you  know       what would you like to do   asked temple   river       oh  no   not now that we ve started for the forest  its feelings  would be hurt if we turned back  i am sure it loves us to love it   although it is so big  like god  you know       yes  i m sure it does  do you really think god cares       of course   said betty   because everything would be so silly if he  didn t  you know  i believe he likes us to love him  and what s more   i believe he likes us to love all the pretty things he s made  trees  and rivers and sunsets and seas       and each other   said temple  and flushed to the ears   human beings   i mean  of course   he added hastily      of course   said betty  unconscious of the flush   but religion tells  you that  it doesn t tell you about the little things  it does say  about herbs of the field and the floods clapping their hands and all  that  but that s only his works praising him  not us loving all his  works  i think he s most awfully pleased when we love some little   nice  tiny thing that he never thought we d notice       did your father teach you to think like this       oh  dear no   said betty   he doesn t like the little pretty things       it s odd   said temple   look at those yellow roses all over that  hideous villa       my step father would only see the villa  well  must we work to day       what would you like to do       i should like to go to those big rocks  the rochers des demoiselles   aren t they   and tie up the pony  and climb up  and sit in a black  shadow and look out over the green tops of the trees  you see things  when you re idle that you never see when you re working  even if  you re trying to paint those very things      so  by and by  the gray pony was unharnessed and tied to a tree in a  cool  grassy place where he also could be happy  and the two others  took the winding stony path     a turn in the smooth worn way brought them to a platform overhanging  the precipice that fell a sheer thirty feet to the tops of the trees  on the slope below  white  silvery sand carpeted the ledge  and on the  sand the shadow of a leaning rock fell blue      here  said betty  and sank down  her sketchbook scooped the sand with  its cover   oh  i  am  hot   she threw off her hat      you don t look it   said temple  and pulled the big bottle of weak  claret and water from the luncheon basket      drink   he said  offering the little glass when he had filled it     betty drank  in little sips      how extraordinarily nice it is to drink when you re thirsty   she  said   and how heavenly this shadow is      a long silence  temple filled and lighted a pipe  from a slope of dry  grass a little below them came the dusty rattle of grasshoppers  talk      it is very good here   said betty   oh  how glad i am i came away  from paris  everything looks different here  i mean the things that  look as if they mattered there don t matter here  and the things that  didn t matter there  oh  here  they do       yes   said temple  making little mounds of sand with the edge of his  hand as he lay   i never expected to have such days in this world as  i ve had here with you  we ve grown to be very good friends here   haven t we       we were very good friends in paris   said betty  remembering the  letter that had announced his departure      but it wasn t the same   he persisted   when did we talk in paris as  we ve talked here       i talked to you  even in paris  more than i ve ever talked to anyone  else  all the same   said betty      thank you   he said   that s the nicest thing you ve ever said to  me       it wasn t meant to be nice   said betty   it s true  don t you know  there are some people you never can talk to without wondering what  they ll think of you  and whether you hadn t better have said  something else  it s nothing to do with whether you like them or not    she went on  thinking of talks with vernon  many talks  and in all of  them she had been definitely and consciously on guard   you may like  people quite frightfully  and yet you can t talk to them       yes   he said   but you couldn t talk to a person you disliked  could  you  real talk  i mean       of course not   said betty   do you know i m dreadfully hungry      it was after lunch that temple said      when are you going home  miss desmond   she looked up  for his use  of her name was rare      i don t know  some time   she answered absently  but the question ran  through her mind like a needle drawing after it the thread on which  were strung all the little longings for long barton  for the familiar  fields and flowers  that had gathered there since she first saw the  silver may and the golden broom at bourron station  that was nearly a  month ago  what a month it had been  the gleaming river  the neat  intimate simplicity of the little culture  white roads  and roses and  rocks  and more than all  trees  and trees and trees again     and with all this  temple  he lodged at montigny  true  and she at  grez  but each day brought to her door the best companion in the  world  he had never even asked how she came to be at grez  after that  first   where s your party   he had guarded his lips  it had seemed so  natural  and so extremely fortunate that he should be here  if she had  been all alone she would have allowed herself to think too much of  vernon  of what might have been      i am going to england next week   he said  betty was shocked to  perceive that this news hurt her  well  why shouldn t it hurt her  she  wasn t absolutely insensible to friendship  she supposed  and  sensibility to friendship was nothing to be ashamed of  on the  contrary      i shall miss you most awfully   said she with the air of one  flaunting a flag      i wish you d go home   he said   haven t you had enough of your  experiment  or whatever it was  yet       i thought you d given up interfering   she said crossly  at least she  meant to speak crossly      i thought i could say anything to you now without your  your not  understanding       so you can   she was suddenly not cross again      ah  no i can t   he said   i want to say things to you that i can t  say here  won t you go home  won t you let me come to see you there   say i may  you will let me      if she said yes  she refused to pursue that train of thought another  inch  if she said no  then a sudden end  and forever an end  to this  good companionship   i wish i had never  never seen  him    she told  herself     then she found that she was speaking      the reason i was all alone in paris   she was saying  the reason took  a long time to expound   the shadow withdrew itself and they had to  shift the camp just when it came to the part about betty s first  meeting with temple himself      and so   she said   i ve done what i meant to do  and i m a hateful  liar  and you ll never want to speak to me again      she rooted up a fern and tore it into little ribbons      why have you told me all this   he said slowly      i don t know   said she      it is because you care  a little bit about  about my thinking well of  you       i can t care about that  or i shouldn t have told you  should i   let s get back home  the pony s lost by this time  i expect       is it because you don t want to have any  any secrets between us       not in the least   said betty  chin in the air   i shouldn t  dream   of telling you my secrets  or anyone else of course  i mean   she  added politely     he sighed   well   he said   i wish you d go home       why don t you say you re disappointed in me  and that you despise me   and that you don t care about being friends any more  with a girl  who s told lies and taken her aunt s money and done everything wrong  you can think of  let s go back  i don t want to stay here any more   with you being silently contemptuous as hard as ever you can  why  don t you say something       i don t want to say the only thing i want to say  i don t want to say  it here  won t you go home and let me come and tell you at long  barton       you do think me horrid  why don t you say so       no  i don t       then it s because you don t care what i am or what i do  i thought a  man s friendship didn t mean much   she crushed the fern into a rough  ball and threw it over the edge of the rock      oh  hang it all   said temple   look here  miss desmond  i came away  from paris because i didn t know what was the matter with me  i didn t  know who it was i really cared about  and before i d been here one  single day  i knew  and then i met you  and i haven t said a word   because you re here alone  and besides i wanted you to get used to  talking to me and all that  and now you say i don t care  no  confound  it all  it s too much  i wanted to ask you to marry me  and i d have  waited any length of time till there was a chance for me   he had  almost turned his back on her  and leaning his chin on his elbow was  looking out over the tree tops far below   and now you ve gone and  rushed me into asking you  now   when i know there isn t the least  chance for me   and anyhow i ought to have held my tongue  and now  it s all no good  and it s your fault  why did you say i didn t care       you knew it was coming   betty told herself   when he asked if he  might come to long barton to see you  you knew it  you might have  stopped it  and you didn t  and now what are you going to do      what she did was to lean back to reach another fern  to pluck and  smooth its fronds      are you very angry   asked temple forlornly      no   said betty   how could i be  but i wish you hadn t  it s spoiled  everything       do you think i don t know all that       i wish i could   said betty very sincerely   but        of course   he said bitterly   i knew that       he doesn t care about me   said betty   he s engaged to someone  else       and you care very much   he kept his face turned away      i don t know   said betty   sometimes i think i m getting not to care  at all       then  look here  may i ask you again some time  and we ll go on just  like we have been       no   said betty   i m going back to england at the end of the week   besides  you aren t quite sure it s me you care for   at least you  weren t when you came away from paris  how can you be sure you re sure  now      he turned and looked at her      i beg your pardon   she said instantly   i think i didn t understand   let s go back now  shall we       for heaven s sake   he said   don t let this break up everything   don t avoid me in the little time that s left  i won t talk about it  any more  i won t worry you        don t be silly   she said  and she smiled at him a little sadly   you  talk as though i didn t know you            chapter xxvi       the miracle     it seemed quite dark down in the forest  or rather  it seemed  after  the full good light that lay upon the summit of the rocks  like the  gray dream twilight under the eyelids of one who dozes in face of a  dying fire      don t let s go straight back to grez   said betty when the pony was  harnessed   let s go on to fontainebleau and have dinner and drive  back by moonlight  don t you think it would be fun  we ve never done  that       thank you   he said   you  are  good      his eyes met hers in the green shadow  and she was satisfied because  he had understood that this was her reply to his appeal to her  not to  avoid him in the little time there was left      both were gay as they drove along the golden roads  gayer than ever  they had been  the nearness of a volcano has never been a bar to  gaiety  dinner was a joyous feast  and when it was over  and the other  guests had strolled out  temple sang all the songs betty liked best   betty played for him  it was all very pleasant  and both pretended   quite beautifully  that they were the best of friends  and that it had  never  never been a question of anything else  the pretence lasted  through all the moonlight of the home drive  lasted indeed till the  pony was trotting along the straight avenue that leads down into grez   and even then it was not temple who broke it  it was betty  and she  laid her hand on his arm      look here   she said   i ve been thinking about it ever since you  said it  and i m not going to let it spoil anything  only i don t want  you to think i don t understand  and i m most awfully proud that you  should     i am really  and i d rather be liked by you than by  anyone        almost   said temple a little bitterly      i don t feel sure about that part of it  really  one feels and thinks  such a lot of different things  and they all contradict everything  else  till one doesn t know what anything means  or what it is one  really  i can t explain  but i don t want you to think your having  talked about it makes any difference  at least i don t mean that at  all  what i mean is that of course i like you ever so much better now  i know that you like me  and  oh  i don t want to  i don t want you to  think it s all no good  because really and truly i don t know      all this time she had kept her hand on his wrist     now he laid his other hand over it      dear   he said   that s all i want  and more than i hoped for now  i  won t say another word about it  ever  if you d rather not   only if  ever you feel that it is me  and not that other chap  then you ll tell  me  won t you       i ll tell you now   said betty   that i wish with all my heart it   was  you  and not the other      when he had said goodnight at the deserted door of the courtyard betty  slipped through the trees to her pavilion  the garden seemed more  crowded with trees than it had ever been  it was almost as though new  trees from the forest had stolen in while she was at fontainebleau   and joined the ranks of those that stood sentinel round the pavilion   there was a lamp in the garden room  as usual  its light poured out  and lay like a yellow carpet on the terrace  and lent to the foliage  beyond that indescribable air of festivity  of light heartedness that  green leaves can always borrow from artificial light      i ll just see if there are any letters   she told herself   there  always might be  from aunt julia or miss voscoe or  someone      she went along the little passage that led to the stairs  the door  that opened from it into the garden room was narrowly ajar  a slice of  light through the chink stood across the passage      oh      there was someone in the room  someone was speaking  she knew the  voice   she must be in soon   it said  it was her aunt julia s voice   she stopped dead  and there was silence in the room     oh  to be caught like this  in a trap  and just when she had decided  to go home  she would not be caught  she would steal up to her room   get her money  leave enough on the table to pay her bill  and  go    she could walk to marlotte  and go off by train in the morning to  brittany  anywhere  she would not be dragged back like a prisoner to  be all the rest of her life with a hateful old man who detested her   aunt julia thought she was very clever  well  she would just find out  that she wasn t  who was she talking to  not madame  for she spoke in  english  to some one from paris  who could have betrayed her  only one  person knew  lady st  craye  well  lady st  craye should not betray  her for nothing  she would not go to brittany  she would go back to  paris  that woman should be taught what it costs to play the traitor     all this in the quite small pause before her aunt s voice spoke again      unless she s got wind of our coming and flown   it said      our  coming  who was the other     betty was eavesdropping then  how dishonourable  well  it is  and she  was      i hope to heaven she s safe   said another voice  oh  it was her  step father  he had come  then he must know everything  she moved   quite without meaning to move  her knee touched the door and it  creaked  very very faintly  but it creaked  would they hear  had they  heard  no  the aunt s voice again      the whole thing s inexplicable to me  i don t understand it  you let  betty go to paris       by your advice       by my advice  but also because you wanted her to be happy       yes  heaven knows i wanted her to be happy   the old man s voice was  sadder than betty had ever heard it      so we found madame gautier for her  and when madame gautier dies  she  doesn t write to you  or wire to you  to come and find her a new  chaperone  why       i can t imagine why       don t you think it may have been because she was afraid of you   thought you d simply make her come back to long barton       it would surely have been impossible for her to imagine that i should  lessen the time which i had promised her  on account of an unfortunate  accident  she knows the depth of my affection for her  no  no  depend  upon it there must have been some other reason for the deceit  i  almost fear to conjecture what the reason may have been  do you think  it possible that she has been seeing that man again      there was a sound as of a chair impatiently pushed back  betty fled  noiselessly to the stairs  no footstep followed the movement of the  chair  she crept back        when you do see her   her aunt was asking   i suppose you mean to  heap reproaches on her  and take her home in disgrace       i hope i shall have strength given me to do my duty   said the  reverend cecil      have you considered what your duty is       it must be my duty to reprove  to show her her deceit in its full  enormity       you ll enjoy that  won t you  it ll gratify your sense of power   you ll stand in the place of god to the child  and you ll be glad to  see her humbled and ashamed       because a thing is painful to me it is none the less my duty       nor any the more   snapped miss desmond   nor any the more  that s  what you won t see  she knows you don t care about her  and that s why  she kept away from you as long as she could       she can t know it  it isn t true       she thinks it is       do  you  think so  do  you  imagine i don t care for her  have you  been poisoning her mind and        oh  don t let s talk about poison   said miss desmond   if she s lost  altogether it won t matter to you  you ll have done your duty       if she s lost i  if she were lost i should not care to be saved  i am  aware that the thought is sinful  but i fear that it is so       of course   said miss desmond   she s not your child  why should you  care  you never had a child       what have i done to you that you should try to torture me like this    it was her step father s voice  but betty hardly knew it   for pity s  sake  woman  be quiet  let me bear what i have to bear without your  chatter       i m sorry   said miss desmond very gently   forgive me if i didn t  understand  and you do really care about her a little       care about her a little  she s the only living thing i do care  for  or ever have cared for except one  oh  it is like a woman to cast  it up at me as a reproach that i have no child  why have i no child   because the woman whom almighty god made for my child s mother was  taken from me  in her youth  before she was mine  her name was lizzie   and my lizzie  my little lizzie that s lied and deceived us  she  is   my child  the one  we  should have had  she s my heart s blood  do you  think i want to scold her  do you think i want to humble her  do you  not perceive how my own heart will be torn  but it is my duty  i will  not spare the rod  and she will understand as you never could  oh  my  little lizzie   oh  pray god she is safe  if it please god to restore  her safely to me  i will not yield to the wicked promptings of my own  selfish affection  i will show her her sin  and we will pray for  forgiveness together  yes  i will not shrink  even if it break my  heart  i will tell her        i should tell her   said miss desmond   just what you ve told me      the old man was walking up and down the room  betty could hear every  movement      it s been the struggle of my life not to spoil her  not to let my  love for her lead me to neglect her eternal welfare  not to lessen her  modesty by my praises  not to condone the sin because of my love for  the sinner  my love has not been selfish   it has been the struggle of  my life not to let my affection be a snare to her       then i must say   said miss desmond   that you might have been better  employed       thank god i have done my duty  you don t understand  but my lizzie  will understand       yes  she will understand   cried betty  bursting open the door and  standing between the two with cheeks that flamed   i do understand   father dear  auntie  i don t understand  you   you re cruel   and it s  not like you  will you mind going away  please      the cruel aunt smiled  and moved towards the door  as she passed betty  she whispered   i thought you were  never  going to come from behind  that door  i couldn t have kept it up much longer      then she went out and closed the door firmly     betty went straight to her step father and put her arms round his  neck      you do forgive me  you will forgive me  won t you   she said  breathlessly     he put an arm awkwardly round her      there s nothing you could do that i couldn t forgive   he said in a  choked voice   but it is my duty not to       she interrupted him by drawing back to look at him  but she kept his  arm where it was  by her hand on his      father   she said   i ve heard everything you ve been saying  it s no  use scolding me  because you can t possibly say anything that i  haven t said to myself a thousand times  sit down and let me tell you  everything  every single thing  i  did  mean to come home this week   and tell you  i truly did  i wish i d gone home before       oh  lizzie   said the old man   how could you  how could you       i didn t understand  i didn t know  i was a blind idiot  oh  father   you ll see how different i ll be now  oh  if one of us had died  and  i d never known       known what  my child  oh  thank god i have you safe  known what       why  that you  how fond you are of me       you didn t know  that        i  i wasn t always sure   betty hastened to say  a miracle had  happened  she could read now in his eyes the appeal that she had  always misread before   but now i shall always be sure  always  and  i m going to be such a good daughter to you  you ll see  if you ll  only forgive me  and you will forgive me  oh  you don t know how i  trust you now       didn t you always       not enough  not nearly enough  but i do now  let me tell you  don t  let me ever be afraid of you  oh  don t let me   she had pushed him  gently into a chair and was half kneeling on the floor beside him      have you ever been afraid of me       oh  i don t know  a little perhaps sometimes  you don t know how  silly i am  but not now  you  are  glad to see me       lizzie   he said   god knows how glad i am  but it s my duty to ask  you at once whether you ve done anything wrong       everything wrong you can think of   she answered enthusiastically    only nothing really wicked  of course  i ll tell you all about it   and oh  do remember you can t think worse of me than i do  oh  it s  glorious not to be afraid       of me   his tone pleaded again      no  no  of anything  of being found out  i m glad you ve come for me   i m glad i ve got to tell you everything  i did mean to go home next  week  but i m glad it s like this  because now i know how much you  care  and i might never have found that out if i hadn t listened at  the door like a mean  disgraceful cat  i ought to be miserable because  i ve done wrong  but i m not  i can t be  i m really most frightfully  happy       thank god you can say that   he said  timidly stroking her hair with  the hand that she was not holding   now i m not afraid of anything you  may have to tell me  my child  my dear child                                                  to four persons the next day was one of the oddest in their lives     arriving early to take betty to finish her sketch  the stricken temple  was greeted on the doorstep by a manly looking lady in gold rimmed  spectacles  short skirts  serviceable brown boots and a mushroom hat      i know who you are   said she   you re mr  temple  i m betty desmond s  aunt  would you like to take me on the river  betty is busy this morning  making the acquaintance of her step father  she s taken him out in the  little cart       i see   said temple   i shall be delighted to take you on the river       nice young man  you don t ask questions  an excellent trait       an acquired characteristic  i assure you   said temple  remembering his  first meeting with betty      then you won t be able to transmit it to your children  that s a pity   however  since you don t ask i ll tell you  the old man has   persistently concealed his real nature  from betty  you d think it was  impossible  living in the same house all these years  last night she  found him out  she s as charmed with the discovery as a girl child with  a doll that opens and shuts its eyes  or a young man with the nonentity  he calls his ideal  come along  she ll spend the morning playing with  her new toy  cheer up  you shall see her at  dejeuner         i  do not need cheering   said the young man   and i don t want you to  tell me things you d rather not  on the contrary        you want me not to tell you the things i d rather tell you       no  i should like to tell you all about        all about yourself  my dear young man  there is nothing i enjoy more   the passion for confidences is my only vice  it was really to indulge  that that i asked you to come on the river with me       i thought   said temple as they reached the landing stage   that  perhaps you had asked me to console me for not seeing your niece this  morning       thank you kindly   miss desmond stepped lightly into the boat   i  rather like compliments  especially when you re solidly built  like  myself  oh  yes  i ll steer  pull hard  bow  she s got no way on her  yet  and the stream s strong just here under the bridge  i gather that  you ve been proposing to my niece       i didn t mean to   said temple  pulling a racing stroke in his  agitation      gently  gently  the diamond sculls aren t at stake  she led you on  you  mean      he rested on his oars a moment and laughed      what is there about you that makes me feel that i ve known you all my  life       possibly it s my enormous age  or it may be that i nursed you when you  were a baby  i have nursed one or two in my time  though i mayn t look  it   so betty entrapped you into a proposal       are you trying to make me angry  it s a dangerous river  can you swim       like any porpoise  but of course i misunderstand people if they won t  explain themselves  you needn t tremble like that  i ll be gentle with  you       if i tremble it s with pleasure   said temple      come  moderate your transports  and unfold your tale  my ears are red   i know  but they are small  well shaped and sympathetic       well then   said temple  and the tale began  by the time it was ended  the boat was at a standstill on the little backwater below the pretties  of the sluices     there was a silence      well   said temple      well   said miss desmond  dipping her hand in the water   what a stream  this is  to be sure   well  your means are satisfactory and you seem to  me to have behaved quite beautifully  i don t think i ever heard of such  profoundly correct conduct       if i ve made myself out a prig   said temple   i m sorry  i could tell  you lots of things       please spare me  why are people always so frightfully ashamed of having  behaved like decent human beings  i esteem you immensely       i d rather you liked me       well  so i do  but i like lots of people i don t esteem  if i d married  anyone it would probably have been some one like that  but for betty  it s different  i shouldn t have needed to esteem my own husband  but i  must esteem hers       i ll try not to deserve your esteem more than i m obliged   said  temple   but your liking  what can i do to deserve that         go on as you ve begun  my dear young man  and you ll be aunt julia s  favourite nephew  no  don t blush  it s an acknowledgement of a tender  speech that i always dispense with       advise me   said he  red to the ears and hands   she doesn t care for  me  at present  what can i do       what most of us have to do  when we want anything worth wanting  wait   we re going home the day after to morrow  if you turn up at long barton  about the middle of september  you might come down for the harvest  festival  it s the yearly excitement  that s what i should do       must i wait so long as that   he asked   why       let me whisper in your ear   said miss desmond  loud above the chatter  of the weir   long barton is very dull  now let s go back       i don t want her to accept me because she s bored       no more do i  but one sees the proportions of things better when one s  dull  and  yes  i esteem you  i like you  you are ingenuous  and  innocuous   no  really that was a yielding to the devil of alliteration   i mean you are a real good sort  the other man has the harmlessness of  the serpent  as for me  i have the wisdom of the dove  you profit by it  and come to long barton in september       it seems like a plot to catch her   said temple      a friend of yours told me you were straight  and you are  i thought  perhaps she flattered you       who   no  i m not to ask questions       lady st  craye       do you know   he said  slowly pulling downstream   there s one thing i  didn t tell you  i came away from paris because i wasn t quite sure that  i wasn t in love with  her        not you   said miss desmond   she d never have suited you  and now  she ll throw herself away on the man with the green eyes and the past  i  mean pasts  and it s a pity  she s a woman after my own heart       she s extraordinarily charming   said temple with a very small sigh      yes extraordinarily  as you say  and so you came away from paris  i  begin to think  you  have a little of the wisdom of the dove too  pull  now  or we shall be late for breakfast      he pulled                                                  now  that    said the reverend cecil that evening to his sister in law    that is the kind of youth i should wish to see my lizzie select for her  help mate       well   said miss desmond   if you keep that wish strictly to yourself   i should think it had a better chance than most wishes of being  gratified            chapter xxvii      the pink silk story     to call on the concierge at betty s old address  and to ask for news of  her had come to seem to vernon the unbroken habit of a life time  there  never was any news  there never would be any news  but there always  might be     the days went by  days occupied in these fruitless gold edged enquiries   in the other rose accompanied enquiries after the health of lady st   craye  and in watching for the postman who should bring the answer to  his formal proposal of marriage     to his deep surprise and increasing disquietude  no answer came  was the  reverend cecil dead  or merely inabordable  had betty despised his offer  too deeply to answer it  the lore learned in  as it seemed  another life  assured him that a woman never despises an offer too much to say  no  to  it     watch for the postman  look at betty s portrait  call on the concierge    he had been used to dislike the employment of dirty instruments   call  on the florist   there was a decency in things  even if all one s being  were contemptibly parched for the sight of another woman   call and  enquire for the poor jasmine lady  studio  think of betty  look at her  portrait  pretend to work  meals at fairly correct intervals  call on  the concierge  look at the portrait again  such were the recurrent  incidents of vernon s life  between the incidents came a padding of  futile endeavour  work  he had always asserted  was the cure for  inconvenient emotions  only now the cure was not available     and the postman brought nothing interesting  except a letter  post mark  denver  col   a letter of tender remonstrance from the brittany girl   miss van tromp     then came the morning when the concierge  demurely assuring him of her  devotion to his interests  offered to post a letter  no bribe  and he  was shameless in his offers  could wring more than that from her  and  even the posting of the letter cost a sum that the woman chuckled over  through all the days during which the letter lay in her locked drawer   under lady st  craye s bank note and the divers tokens of   ce  monsieur s   interest in the intrigue  whatever the intrigue might  be  its details were not what interested     vernon went home  pulled the table into the middle of the bare studio  and wrote  this letter wrote itself without revision        why did you go away   it said   where are you  where can i see you     what has happened  have your people found out      a long pause  the end of the pen bitten        i want to have no lies or deceit any more between us  i must tell    you the truth  i have never been engaged to anyone  but you would    not let me see you without that  so i let you think it  will you    forgive me  can you  for lying to you  if you can t i shall know    that nothing matters at all  but if you can forgive me  then i shall    let myself hope for impossible things        dear  whether it s all to end here or not  let me write this once    without thinking of anything but you and me  i have written to your    father asking his permission to ask you to marry me  to you i want    to say that i love you  love you  love you  and i have never loved    anyone else  that s part of my punishment for  i don t know what    exactly  playing with fire  i suppose  dear  can you love me  ever    since i met you at long barton   pause  what about miss van tromp     nothing  nothing  nothing    i ve not thought of anything but you  i    want you for my very own  there is no one like you  my love  my    princess        you ll write to me  even if you don t care a little bit you ll    write  dear  i hardly dare hope that you care  but i daren t fear    that you don t  i shall count the minutes till i get your answer  i    feel like a schoolboy        dear it s my very heart i m sending you here  if i didn t love you     love you  love you i could write a better letter  tell you better    how i love you  write now  you will write        did someone tell you something or write you something that made you    go away  it s not true  whatever it is  nothing s true  but that i    want you  as i ve never wanted anything  let me see you  let me tell    you  i ll explain everything  if anyone  has  been telling lies        if you don t care enough to write  i don t care enough to go on    living  oh  my dear dear  all the words and phrases have been used    up before  there s nothing new to  say   i know  but what s in my    heart for you  that s new  that s all that matters  that and what    your heart might hold for me  does it  tell me  if i can t have your    love  i can t bear my life  and i won t   you ll think this letter    isn t like me  it isn t  i know  but i can t help it  i am a new    man  and you have made me  dear   can t you love the man you ve    made  write  write  write        yours  as i never thought i could be anyone s        eustace vernon       it s too long   he said   most inartistic  but i won t re write it   contemptible ass  if she cares it won t matter  if she doesn t  it won t  matter either      and that was the letter that lay in the locked drawer for a week  and  through that week the watching for the postman went on  went on  and the  enquiries  mechanically     and no answer came at all  to either of his letters  had the concierge  deceived him  had she really no address to which to send the letter      are you sure that you posted the letter       altogether  monsieur   said the concierge  fingering the key of the  drawer that held it     and the hot ferment of paris life seethed and fretted all around him  if  betty were at long barton  oh  the dewy gray grass in the warren  and  the long shadows on the grass     three days more went by      you have posted the letter       but yes  monsieur  be tranquil  without doubt it was a letter that  should exact time for the response      it was on the fifth day that he met mimi chantal  the prettiest model on  the left bank      is monsieur by chance painting the great picture which shall put him  between velasquez and caran d ache on the last day       i am painting nothing   said vernon   and why is the prettiest model in  paris not at work       i was in lateness but a little quarter of an hour  monsieur  and behold  me  chucked       it wasn t for the first time  then       a nothing one or two days last week  monsieur had better begin to paint  that  chef d oeuvre   to day even  it isn t often that the prettiest  model in paris is free to sit at a moment s notice       but   said vernon   i haven t an idea for a picture even  it is too hot  for ideas  i m going into the country at the end of the month  to do  landscape       to paint a picture it is then absolutely necessary to have an idea       an idea  or a commission       there is always something that lacks  with me it is the technique that  is to seek  with you the ideas  otherwise we should both be masters  for  you have technique both hands full  i have ideas  me       tell me some of them   said vernon  strolling along by her side  it was  not his habit to stroll along beside models  but to day he was fretted  and chafed by long waiting for that answer to his letter  anything  seemed better than the empty studio where one waited      here is one  i have the idea that artists have no eyes  how they pose  me ever as l ete or la source or leda  or that clumsy suzanne with her  eternal old men  as if they knew better than i do how a woman holds  herself up or sits herself down  or nurses a duck  or defends herself       your idea is probably correct  i understand you to propose that i  should paint a picture called the blind artist       don t do the imbecile  i propose for subject me  not posed  me as i am  in the rest  is it not that it is then that i am the most pretty  the  most chic       it certainly is   said he   and you propose that i should paint you as  you appear in the rest       perfectly   she interrupted   tender rose colour  it goes to a marvel  with my cleo de merode hair  and if you want a contrast  or one of those  little tricks to make people say   what does it mean        i don t  thank you   he laughed      paint that white drowned girl s face that hangs behind your stove   paint her and me looking at each other  she has the air of felicitating  herself that she is dead  me  i will have the air of felicitating myself  that i am alive  you will see  monsieur  essay but one sole little  sketch  and you will think of nothing else  one might entitle it  the  rivals        or  the rest    said vernon  a little interested   oh  well  i m not  doing anything   i ll make a sketch and give it you as a present  come  in an hour                                                   auntie  wake up  wake up   betty  white faced and determined  was  pulling back the curtain with fingers that rigidly would not tremble      shut the door and spare my blushes   said her aunt   what s up now    she looked at the watch on the bed table   why its only just six       i can t help it   said betty   you ve had all the night to sleep in  i  haven t  i want you to get up and dress and come to paris with me by the  early train       sit down   said the aunt   no  not on the bed  i hate that  in this  chair  now remember that we all parted last night in the best of  spirits  and that as far as i know nothing has happened since       oh  no  nothing of course   said betty      don t be ironical   said miss desmond   at six in the morning it s  positively immoral  tell me all  let me hear the sad sweet story of your  life       very well   said betty   if you re only going to gibe i ll go alone  or  i ll get mr  temple to take me       to see the other man  that  will  be nice       who said anything about         you did  the moment you came in  come child  sit down and tell me  i m  not unsympathetic  i m only very  very sleepy  and i  did  think  everything was arranged  i was dreaming of orange blossoms and the voice  that breathed  and the most beautiful trousseau marked e t  and silver  fish knives  and salt cellars in a case lined with purple velvet       go on   said betty   if it amuses you       no  no  i m sorry  forgive the ravings of delirium  go on  poor little  betty  don t worry  tell its own aunt       it s not a joke   said betty      so i more and more perceive  now that i m really waking up   said the  aunt  sitting up and throwing back her thick blond hair   come  i ll get  up now  give me my stockings  and tell me        they were under my big hat   said betty  doing as she was told   the  one i wore the night you came  and i d thrown it down on the chest of  drawers  and they were underneath       my stockings       no  my letters  two of them  and one of them s from him  it s a week  old  and he says he won t live if i don t love him       they always do   said miss desmond  pouring water into the basin    well       and he wants me to marry him  and he was never engaged to lady st   craye  and it was a lie  i ve had a letter from  her        i can t understand a word you say   said miss desmond through  splashings      my friend paula  that i told you about  she never went home to her  father  mr  vernon set her up in a restaurant  oh  how good and noble he  is  here are your shoes  and he says he won t live without me  and i m  going straight off to him  and i wouldn t go without telling you  it s  no use telling father yet  but i did think  you d  understand       hand me that green silk petticoat  thank you   what  did you think i d  understand       why that i  that it s him i love       you do  do you       yes  always  always  and i must go to him  but i won t go and leave  bobbie to think i m going to marry him some day  i must tell him first   and then i m going straight to paris to find him  and give him the  answer to his letter       you must do as you like  it s your life  not mine  but it s a pity    said her aunt   and i should send a telegram to prepare him       the office won t be open  there s a train at seven forty five  oh  do  hurry  i ve ordered the pony  we ll call and tell mr  temple      it was not the      that was caught  however  but the        because  temple was  naturally  in bed  when he had been roused  and had dressed  and come out to them  in the gay terrace overhanging the river where the  little tables are and the flowers in pots and the vine covered trellis   miss desmond turned and positively fled before the gay radiance of his  face      this is dear and sweet of you   he said to betty      what lovely scheme have you come to break to me  but what s the matter   you re not ill       oh  don t   said betty   don t look like that  i couldn t go without  telling you  it s all over  bobbie      she had never before called him by that name  and now she did not know  what she had called him      what s all over   he asked mechanically      everything   she said   your thinking i was going to  perhaps  some  time  and all that  because now i never shall  o  bobbie  i do hate  hurting you  and i do like you so frightfully much  but he s written to  me  the letter s been delayed  and it s all a mistake  and i m going to  him now  oh   i hope you ll be able to forgive me       it s not your fault   he said   wait a minute  it s so sudden  yes  i  see  don t you worry about me  dearest  i shall be all right  may i know  who it is       it s mr  vernon   said betty      oh  my god   temple s hand clenched   no  no  no  no       i am so very  very sorry   said betty in the tone one uses who has  trodden on another s foot in an omnibus     he had sat down at one of the little tables  and was looking out over  the shining river with eyes half shut      but it s not true   he said   it can t be true  he s going to marry  lady st  craye       that s all a mistake   said betty eagerly   he only said that  because  i haven t time to tell you all about it now  but it was all a  mistake       betty  dear   he said  using in his turn  for the first time  her  christian name   don t do it  don t marry him  you don t know       i thought you were his friend       so i am   said temple   i like him right enough  but what s all the  friendship in the world compared with your happiness  don t marry  him  dear  don t       i shall marry whom i choose   said betty  chin in air   and it won t be  you     i don t care if i am vulgar and brutal   she told herself   it  serves him right       it s not for me  dear  it s not for me  it s for you  i ll go right  away and never see you again  marry some straight chap  anyone  but not  vernon       i am going to marry mr  vernon   said betty with lofty calm   and i am  very sorry for any annoyance i may have caused you  of course  i see now  that i could never  i mean   she added angrily   i hate people who are  false to their friends  yes  and now i ve missed my train      she had      forgive me   said temple when the fact was substantiated  and the gray  pony put up   after all  i was your friend before i  before you  before  all this that can t come to anything  let me give you both some coffee  and see you to the station  and betty  don t you go and be sorry about  me afterwards  because  really  it s not your fault and   he laughed and  was silent a moment   and i d rather have loved you and have it end like  this  dear  than never have known you  i truly would      the journey to paris was interminable  betty had decided not to think of  temple  yet that happy morning face of his would come between her and  the things she wanted to think of  to have hurt him like that   it hurt  her horribly  much more than she would have believed possible  and she  had been cruel   of course it s natural that he should say things about  him  he must hate anyone that  he nearly cried when he said that about  rather have loved me than not  yes    a lump came in betty s own throat   and her eyes pricked      come  don t cry   said her aunt briskly   you ve made your choice  and  you re going to your lover  don t be like lot s wife  you can t eat your  cake and have it too      vernon s concierge assured these ladies that monsieur was at home      he makes the painting in this moment   she said   mount then  my  ladies      they mounted     betty remembered her last  her first  visit to his studio  when paula  had disappeared and she had gone to him for help  she remembered how the  velvet had come off her dress  and how awful her hair had been when she  had looked in the glass afterwards  and lady st  craye  how beautifully  dressed  how smiling and superior      hateful cat   said betty on the stairs      eh   said her aunt     now there would be no one in the studio but vernon  he would be reading  over her letters  nothing in them  only little notes about whether she  would or wouldn t be free on tuesday  whether she could or couldn t dine  with him on wednesday  but he would be reading them over  perhaps      the key was in the door      do you mind waiting on the stairs  auntie dear   said betty in a voice  of honey   just the first minute   i would like to have it for us  two  alone  you don t mind       do as you like   said the aunt rather sadly   i should knock if i were  you      betty did not knock  she opened the studio door softly  she would like  to see him before he saw her     she had her wish     a big canvas stood on the easel  a stool in front of it  the table was  in the middle of the room  a yellow embroidered cloth on it  there was  food on the cloth  little breads  pretty cakes and strawberries and  cherries  and wine in tall  beautiful  topaz coloured glasses     vernon sat in his big chair  betty could see his profile  he sat there   laughing  on the further arm of the chair sat  laughing also  a very  pretty young woman  her black hair was piled high on her head and  fastened with a jewelled pin  the sunlight played in the jewels  she  wore a pink silk garment  she held cherries in her hand       v la cheri    she said  and put one of the twin cherries in her mouth   then she leant over him laughing  and vernon reached his head forward to  take in his mouth the second cherry that dangled below her chin  his  mouth was on the cherry  and his eyes in the black eyes of the girl in  pink     betty banged the door      come away   she said to miss desmond  and she  who had seen  too  the  pink picture  came away  holding betty s arm tight      i wonder   she said as they reached the bottom of the staircase   i  wonder he didn t come after us to  to  try to explain       i locked the door   said betty   don t speak to me  please      they were in the train before either broke silence  betty s face was  white and she looked old  thirty almost her aunt thought      illustration   on the further arm of the chair sat  laughing also  a  very pretty young woman      it was miss desmond who spoke      betty   she said   i know how you feel  but you re very young  i think  i ought to say that that girl         don t    said betty      i mean what we saw doesn t necessarily mean that he doesn t love you       perhaps not   said betty  fierce as a white flame   anyhow  it means  that i don t love him      miss desmond s tact  worn by three days of anxiety and agitation  broke  suddenly  and she said what she regretted for some months      oh  you don t love  him  now  well  the other man will console you       i hate you   said betty   and i hate him  and i hope i shall never see  a man again as long as i live            chapter xxviii        and so       the banging of his door  the locking of it  annoyed vernon  yet  interested him but little  one s acquaintances have such queer notions  of humour  he had the excuse  and by good luck the rope  to explore his  celebrated roofs  mimi was more agitated than he  so he dismissed her  for the day with many compliments and a bunch of roses  and spent what  was left of the light in painting in a background to the sketch of  betty  the warren as his sketch book helped him to remember it  perhaps  he and she would go there together some day     he looked with extreme content at the picture on the easel     he had worked quickly and well  the thing was coming splendidly  mimi  had been right  she could pose herself as no artist had ever posed her   he would make a picture of the thing after all     the next morning brought him a letter  that he  who had hated letters   should have come to care for a letter more than for anything that could  have come to him except a girl  he kissed the letter before he opened  it      at last   he said   oh  this minute was worth waiting for      he opened the envelope with a smile mingled of triumph and something  better than triumph  and read        dear mr  vernon        i hope that nothing in my manner has led you to expect any other    answer than the one i must give  that answer is  of course   no      although thanking you sincerely for your flattering offer  i am    obliged to say that i have never thought of you except as a friend     i was extremely surprised by your letter  i hope i have not been in    any way to blame  with every wish for your happiness  and regrets    that this should have happened  i am yours faithfully        elizabeth desmond      he read the letter  re read it  raised his eyebrows  then he took two  turns across the studio  shrugged his shoulders impatiently  lit a match  and watched the letter burn  as the last yellow moving sparks died in  the black of its ash  he bit his lip      damn   he said   oh  damn      next day he went to spain  a bunch of roses bigger and redder than any  roses he had ever sent her came to lady st  craye with his card  p d a   in the corner     she  too  shrugged her shoulders  bit her lip and  arranged the roses in  water  presently she tried to take up her life at the point where she  had laid it down when  last october  vernon had taken it into his hands   succeeding as one does succeed in such enterprises     it was may again when vernon found himself once more sitting at one of  the little tables in front of the cafe de la paix      sit here long enough   he said   and you see every one you have ever  known or ever wanted to know  last year it was the jasmine lady  and  that girl  on the same one and wonderful day  this year it s  by jove      he rose and moved among the closely set chairs and tables to the  pavement  the sightless stare of light blanched spectacles met his eyes   a gentlemanly looking lady in short skirts stood awaiting him      how are you   she said   yes  i know you didn t see me  but i thought  you d like to       i do like to  indeed  may i walk with you  or    he glanced back at the  table where his vermouth stood untasted      the impertinence of it  frightfully improper to sit outside cafes   isn t it   for women  i mean  and this cafe in particular  yes  i ll  join you with the greatest pleasure  coffee please       it s ages since i saw you   he said amiably   not since        since i called on you at your hotel  how frightened you were       not for long   he answered  looking at her with the eyes she loved  the  eyes of someone who was not vernon   ah  me  a lot of water has run        not under the bridges   she pleaded   say off the umbrellas       since   he pursued   we had that good talk  you remember  i wanted to  call on you in london and you wouldn t let me  you might let me now       i will   she said      curzon street  your eyes haven t changed colour  a bit  nor your nature  i suppose  yet something about you s changed   got over betty yet       quite  thanks   he said tranquilly   but last time we met  you remember  we agreed that i had no intentions       illustration   the next morning  brought him a letter       wrong lead   she said  smiling frankly at him   and besides i hold all  the trumps  ace  king  queen  and ace  knave and queen of another suit       expound  i implore       aces equal general definite and decisive information  king and queen of  hearts equal betty and the other man       there was another man then       there always is  isn t there  knave  your honoured self  queen  where  is the queen  by the way   the beautiful queen with the sad eyes  blind   poor dear  quite blind to everything but the abominable knave       meaning me       it s not an unbecoming cap   she said  stirring her coffee   and you  wear it with an air  where s the queen of your suit       i confess i m at fault       the odd trick is mine  and the honours  you may as well throw down your  hand  yes  i play whist  not bridge  where is your queen  lady st   what  is it       i haven t seen her   he said steadily   since last june  i left paris  on a sudden impulse  and i hadn t time to say good bye to her       didn t you even leave a card  that s not like your eyes       i think i sent a tub of hydrangeas or something   pour dire adieu        that was definite  remember the date       no   he said  remembering perfectly      not the eleventh  was it  that was the day when you would get betty s  letter of rejection       it may have been the eleventh   in fact it  was        ah  that s better  and the tenth  who let you out of your studio on the  tenth  i ve often wondered       i ve often wondered who locked me in  it couldn t have been you  of  course       as you say  but i was there       it wasn t         but it was  i thought you d guess that  she got your letter and came up  ready to fall into your arms  opened the door softly like any heroine  of fiction  i told her to knock  but no  beheld the pink silk picture  and fled the happy shore forever       damn   he said   i do beg your pardon  but really        don t waste those really convincing damns on ancient history  i told  her it didn t mean that you didn t love her       that was clear sighted of you       it was also quite futile  she said it means  she  didn t love  you  at  any rate  i suppose she wrote and told you so      a long pause  then      as you say   said vernon   it s ancient history  but you said something  about another man       oh  yes  your friend temple   say  damn  again if it s the slightest  comfort to you  i ve heard worse words       when   asked vernon  and he sipped his vermouth   not straight away       bless me  no  months and months  that picture in your studio gave her  the distaste for all men for quite a long time  we took her home  her  father and me  by the way  he and she are tremendous chums now       well       you don t want me to tell you the sweet secret tale of their betrothal   he just came down  at christmas it was  she was decorating the church   her father had a transient gleam of common sense and sent him down to  her   is it you    is it you    all was over  they returned to that  rectory an engaged couple  they were made for each other   same tastes   same sentiments  they love the same things  gardens scenery  the simple  life  lofty ideals  cathedrals and walt whitman       and when are they to be married       they are married   what are we waiting for  you and i   no  i don t  know which of them said it  they were married at easter  sunday school  children throwing cowslips  quite idyllic  all the old ladies from the  mother s mutual twaddle club came and shed fat tears  they presented a  tea set  maroon with blue roses  most  igh class and select       easter   said vernon  refusing interest to the maroon and blue  tea cups   she must indeed have been extravagantly fond of me       not she  she wanted to be in love  we all do  you know  and you were  the first  but she d never have suited you  i ve never known but two  women who would       two   he said   which       myself for one  saving your presence   she laughed and finished her  coffee   if i d happened to meet you when i was young  and not  bad looking  it s only my age that keeps you from falling in love with  me  the other one s the queen of your suit  poor lady  that you sent the  haystack of sunflowers to  well  good bye  come and see me when you re  in town     curzon street  don t forget       i shan t forget   he said   and if i thought you would condescend to  look at me  it isn t what you call your age that would keep me from  falling in love with you       heaven defend me   she cried    au revoir                                                   when vernon had finished his vermouth  he strolled along to the street  where last year lady st  craye had had a flat     yes  madame retained still the apartment  it was to day that madame  received  but the last of the friends of madame had departed  monsieur  would find madame alone     monsieur found madame alone  and reading  she laid the book face  downwards on the table and held out the hand he had always  loved  slender  and loosely made  that one felt one could so easily  crush in one s own      how time flies   she said   it seems only yesterday that you were here   how sweet you were to me when i had influenza  how are you  you look  very tired       i am tired   he said   i have been in spain  and in italy  and in  algiers       very fatiguing countries  i understand  and what is your best news      he stood on the hearth rug  looking down at her      betty desmond s married   he said      yes   she answered   to that nice boy temple  too  i saw it in the  paper  dreadful isn t it  here to day and gone to morrow       i ll tell you why she married him   said vernon  letting himself down  into a chair   if you d like me to  at least i ll tell you why she  didn t marry me  but perhaps the subject has ceased to interest you       not at all   she answered with extreme politeness     so he told her      yes  i suppose it would be like that  it must have annoyed you very  much  it s left marks on your face  eustace  you look tired to death       that sort of thing does leave marks       that girl taught you something  eustace  something that s stuck       it is not impossible  i suppose   he said and then very carelessly  as  one leading the talk to lighter things  he added   i suppose you  wouldn t care to marry me       candidly   she answered  calling all her powers of deception to her  aid   candidly  i don t think i should       i knew it   said vernon  smiling   my heart told me so       she   said lady st  craye   was frightened away from her life s  happiness  as they call it  by seeing you rather near to a pink silk  model  i suppose you think  i  shouldn t mind such things       you forget   said vernon demurely   such things never happen after one  is married       no   she said   of course they don t  i forgot that       you might as well marry me   he said  and the look of youth had come  back suddenly  as it s way was  to his face      i might very much better not      they looked at each other steadily  she saw in his eyes a little of what  it was that betty had taught him     she never knew what he saw in hers  for all in a moment he was kneeling  beside her  his arm was across the back of her chair  his head was on  her shoulder and his face was laid against her neck  as the face of a  child  tired with a long play day  is laid against the neck of its  mother      ah  be nice to me   he said   i am very tired      her arm went round his shoulders as the mother s arm goes round the  shoulders of the child       the end                       charitable donations in all    states of the united  states  compliance requirements are

staff     please check thethe east    as simply hateful  blazing  barren  bleak     and longs again to find himself in rome     after the tumult of its streets  its trains    of slaves and clients  and its villas cool    with marble porticoes beside the sea     and friends and banquets  more than all  its games      this life seems blank and flat  he pants to stand    in its vast circus all alive with heads    and quivering arms and floating robes  the air    thrilled by the roaring  fremitus  of men      the sunlit awning heaving overhead     swollen and strained against its corded veins    and flapping out its hem with loud report      the wild beasts roaring from the pit below      the wilder crowd responding from above    with one long yell that sends the startled blood    with thrill and sudden flush into the cheeks      a hundred trumpets screaming  the dull thump    of horses galloping across the sand      the clang of sabbards  the sharp clash of steel      live swords  that whirl a circle of grey fire      brass helmets flashing  neath their streaming hair      a universal tumult  then a hush    worse than the tumult  all eyes staining down    to the arena s pit  all lips set close      all muscles strained  and then that sudden yell      habet    that s rome  says lucius  so it is     that is   tis  his  rome   tis not yours and mine       and yet  great

walk has calmed me  i begin again      letting this last page  since it is written  stand     lucius is going  you will see him soon    in our great forum  there with him will walk     and hear him rail and rave against the east     i stay behind  for these bare silences     these hills that in the sunset melt and burn     this proud stern people  these dead seas and lakes     these sombre cedars  this intense still sky     to me  o erwearied with life s din and strain     are grateful as the solemn blank of night    after the fierce day s irritant excess     besides  a deep absorbing interest    detains me here  fills up my mind  and sways    my inmost thoughts  has got  as  twere a gripe    upon my very life  as strange as new     i scarcely know how well to speak of this     fearing your raillery at best  at worst    even your contempt  yet  spite of all  i speak       first  do not deem me to have lost my head     sunstruck  as that man paulus was at rome     no  i am sane as ever  and my pulse    beats even  with no fever in my blood     and yet i half incline to think his words     wild as they were  were not entirely wild     nay  shall i dare avow it  i half tend     here in this place  surrounded by these men      despite the jeering natural at first     and then the pressure of my life long thought    trained up against it  to excuse his faith     and half admit the christus he thinks god    is  at the least  a most mysterious man     bear with me if i now avow so much     when next we meet i will expose my mind     but now the subject i must scarcely touch       how many a time  while sauntering up and down    the forum s space  or pausing  neath the shade    of some grand temple  arch  or portico     have we discussed some knotty point of law     some curious case  whose contradicting facts    looked janus faced to innocence and guilt     i see you now arresting me  to note    with quiet fervor and uplifted hand    some subtle view or fact by me o erlooked     and urging me  who always strain my point     being too much  i know  a partisan      to pause  and press not to the issue so     but more apart  with less impetuous zeal     survey as from an upper floor the facts       i need you now to rein me in  too quick    to ride a whim beyond the term of truth     for here a case comes up to which in vain    i seek a clue  you could clear up my mind     but you are absent  so i send these notes       the case is of one judas  simon s son     iscariot called  a jew  and one of those    who followed christus  held by some a god     but deemed by others to have preached and taught    a superstition vile  of which one point    was worship of an ass  but this is false     judas  his follower  all the sect declare     bought by a bribe of thirty silver coins     basely betrayed his master unto death     the question is  did judas  doing this     act from base motives and commit a crime     or  all things taken carefully in view     can he be justified in what he did       here on the spot  surrounded by the men    who acted in the drama  i have sought    to study out this strange and tragic case     many are dead  as herod  caiaphas     and also pilate  a most worthy man     under whose rule  but all without his fault     and  as i fancy  all against his will     christus was crucified  this i regret     his words with me would have the greatest weight     but lysias still is living  an old man     the chief of the centurions  whose report    is to be trusted  as he saw and heard     not once  but many a time and oft  this man     his look and bearing  lysias thus describes      tall  slender  not erect  a little bent     brows arched and dark  a high ridged lofty head     thin temples  veined and delicate  large eyes     sad  very serious  seeming as it were    to look beyond you  and whene er he spoke    illumined by an inner lamping light      at times  too  gleaming with a strange wild fire    when taunted by the rabble in the streets     a jewish face  complexion pale but dark     thin  high art nostrils  quivering constantly     long nose  full lips  hands tapering  full of veins     his movements nervous  as he walked he seemed    scarcely to heed the persons whom he passed     and for the most part gazed upon the ground        as for his followers  i knew them all      a strange mad set and full of fancies wild      john  peter  james  and judas best of all      all seemed to me good men without offence      a little crazed  but who is wholly sane     they went about and cured the sick and halt     and gave away their money to the poor     and all their talk was charity and peace     if christus thought and said he was a god      twas harmless madness  not deserving death     what most aroused the wealthy rabbis  rage    was that he set the poor against the rich     and cried that rich men all would go to hell     and  worst of all  roundly denounced the priests     with all their rich phylacteries and robes      said they were hypocrites who made long prayers     and robbed poor widows and devoured their means     and were at best but whited sepulchres     and this it was that brought him to the cross        those who went with him and believed in him    were mostly dull  uneducated men     simple and honest  dazed by what he did     and misconceiving every word he said     he led them with him in a spell bound awe     and all his cures they called miraculous     they followed him like sheep where er he went     with feelings mixed of wonder  fear and love     yes  i suppose they loved him  though they fled    stricken with fear when we arrested him         what  all  all fled   i asked   did none remain       not one   he said   all left him to his fate     not one dared own he was a follower      not one gave witness for him of them all     stop  when i say not one of them  i mean    no one but judas  judas whom they call    the traitor  who betrayed him to his death     he rushed into the council hall and cried       tis i have sinned  christus is innocent         and here i come to what of all i ve heard    most touched me  i for this my letter write     paulus  you know  had only for this man     this judas  words of scorn and bitter hate     mark now the different view that lysias took     when  urged by me  his story thus he told        some say that judas was a base  vile man    who sold his master for the meanest bribe     others again insist he was most right     giving to justice one who merely sought    to overthrow the church  subvert the law     and on its ruins build himself a throne     i  knowing judas  and none better knew      i  caring naught for christus more than him     but hating lies  the simple truth will tell     no man can say i ever told a lie      i am too old now to begin  besides     the truth is truth  and let the truth be told     judas  i say  alone of all the men    who followed christus thought that he was god     some feared him for his power of miracles     some were attracted by a sort of spell     some followed him to hear his sweet  clear voice    and gentle speaking  hearing with their ears     and knowing not the sense of what he said      but one alone believed he was the lord     the true messiah of the jews  that one    was judas  he alone of all the crowd        he to betray his master for a bribe     he last of all  i say this friend of mine    was brave when all the rest were cowards there     his was a noble nature  frank and bold     almost to rashness bold  yet sensitive     who took his dreams for firm realities      who once believing  all in all believed      rushing at obstacles and scorning risk     ready to venture all to gain his end     no compromise or subterfuge for him     his act went from his thought straight to the butt     yet with this ardent and impatient mood    was joined a visionary mind that took    impressions quick and fine  yet deep as life     therefore it was that in this subtle soil    the master s words took root and grew and flowered     he heard and followed and obeyed  his faith    was serious  earnest  real  winged to fly     he doubted not  like some who walked with him      desired no first place  as did james and john      denied him not with peter  not to him    his master said   away  thou rt an offence     get thee behind me  satan    not to him      am i so long with ye who know me not      fixed as a rock  untempted by desires    to gain the post of honor when his lord    should come to rule  chosen from out the midst    of six score men as his apostle  then    again selected to the place of trust     unselfish  honest  he among them walked        that he was honest  and was so esteemed     is plain from this  they chose him out of all    to bear the common purse  and take and pay     john says he was a thief  because he grudged    the price that for some ointment once was paid     and urged  twere better given to the poor     but did not christus ever for the poor    lift up his voice   give all things to the poor     sell everything and give all to the poor      and judas  who believed  not made believe     used his own words  and christus  who excused    the gift because of love  rebuked him not     thief  ay  he  twas  this very thief  they chose    to bear the purse and give alms to the poor     i  for my part  see nothing wrong in this         but why  if judas was a man like this     frank  noble  honest   here i interposed       why was it that he thus betrayed his lord         this question oft did i revolve   said he      when all the facts were fresh  and oft revolved    in latter days  and with no change of mind     and this is my solution of the case        daily he heard his master s voice proclaim      i am the lord  the father lives in me     who knoweth me knows the eternal god     he who believes in me shall never die     no  he shall see me with my angels come    with power and glory here upon the earth    to judge the quick and dead  among you here    some shall not taste of death before i come    god s kingdom to establish on the earth         what meant these words  they seethed in judas  soul     here is my god  messias  king of kings     christus  the lord  the saviour of us all     how long shall he be taunted and reviled     and threatened by this crawling scum of men     oh  who shall urge the coming of that day    when he in majesty shall clothe himself    and stand before the astounded world its king      long brooding over this inflamed his soul     and  ever rash in schemes as wild in thought     at last he said   no longer will i bear    this ignominy heaped upon my lord     no man hath power to harm the almighty one     ay  let men s hands be lifted  then at once     effulgent like the sun  swift like the sword     the jagged lightning flashes from the cloud     shall he be manifest  the living god      and prostrate all shall on the earth adore         such was his thought when at the passover    the lord with his disciples met and supped     and christus saw the trouble in his mind     and said  behold  among you here is one    that shall betray me  he to whom i give    this sop   and he the sop to judas gave     and added   that thou doest  quickly do      and judas left him  hearing these last words       now shall the son of man be glorified         ah yes  his master had divined his thought      his master should be glorified through him        straight unto me and the high priests he came     filled with this hope  and said   behold me here     judas  a follower of christus  come     i will point out my master whom you seek      and out at once they sent me with my band     and as we went  i said  rebuking him      how  judas  is it you who thus betray    the lord and master whom you love  to death      and  smiling  then he answered   fear you not    do you your duty  take no heed of me       is not this vile   i said   i had not deemed    such baseness in you    though it seems so now      still smiling he replied   wait till the end      then turning round as to himself he said      now comes the hour that i have prayed to see      the hour of joy to all who know the truth          is this man mad   i thought  and looked at him     and  in the darkness creeping swiftly on     his face was glowing  almost shone with light     and rapt as if in visionary thought    he walked beside me  gazing at the sky        passing at last beyond the cedron brook    we reached a garden on whose open gate    dark vines were loosely swinging  here we paused    and lifted up our torches  and beheld    against the blank white wall a shadowy group     there waiting motionless  without a word     a moment  and with rapid  nervous step    judas alone advanced  and  as he reached    the tallest figure lifted quick his head     and crying   master  master   kissed his cheek     we  knowing it was christus  forward pressed     malchus was at my side  when suddenly    a sword flashed out from one among them there     and sheared his ear  at once our swords flashed out     but christus  lifting up his hand  said   peace     sheathe thy sword  peter  i must drink the cup      and i cried also   peace  and sheathe your swords      then on his arm i placed my hand  and said      in the law s name   he nothing said  but reached    his arm out  and we bound his hands with cords     this done i turned  but all the rest had fled     and he alone was left to meet his fate        my men i ordered then to take and bear    their prisoner to the city  and at once    they moved away  i  seeing not our guide     cried   judas   but no answer  then a groan    so sad and deep it startled me  i turned     and there against the wall  with ghastly face     and eyeballs starting in a frenzied glare     as in a fit  lay judas  his weak arms    hung lifeless down  his mouth half open twitched     his hands were clutched and clinched into his robes     and now and then his breast heaved with a gasp     frightened i dashed some water in his face     spoke to him  lifted him  and rubbed his hands     at last the sense came back into his eyes     then with a sudden spasm fled again     and to the ground he dropped  i searched him o er     fearing some mortal wound  yet none i found     then with a gasp again the life returned     and stayed  but still with strong convulsion twitched      speak  judas  speak   i cried  what does this mean     no answer   speak  man   then at last he groaned      go  leave me  leave me  lysias  oh  my god     what have i done  oh  christus  master  lord     forgive me  oh  forgive me   then a cry    of agony that pierced me to the heart     as groveling on the ground he turned away    and hid his face  and shuddered in his robes     was this the man whose face an hour ago    shone with a joy so strange  what means it all     is this a sudden madness   speak   i cried      what means this  judas  be a man and speak      yet there he lay  and neither moved nor spoke     i thought that he had fainted  till at last     sudden he turned  grasped my arm  and cried      say  lysias  is this true  or am i mad       what true   i said   true that you seized the lord     you could not seize him  he is god the lord     i thought i saw you seize him  yet i know    that was impossible  for he is god     and yet you live  you live  he spared you  then     where am i  what has happened  a black cloud    came o er me when you laid your hands on him     where are they all  where is he  lysias  speak          judas   i said   what folly is all this     christus my men have bound and borne away     the rest have fled  rouse now and come with me     my men await me  rouse yourself and come         throwing his arms up  in a fit he fell     with a loud shriek that pierced the silent night     i could not stay  but  calling instant aid     we bore him quick to the adjacent house     and placing him in kindly charge  i left     joining my men who stayed for me below        straight to the high priest s house we hurried on     and christus in an inner room we placed     set at his door a guard  and then came out     after a time there crept into the hall    where round the blazing coals we sat  a man     who in the corner crouched   what man are you      cried some one  and i turning  looked at him      twas peter    tis a fellow of that band    that followed christus  and believed in him        tis false   cried peter  and he cursed and swore      i know him not  i never saw the man      but i said nothing  soon he went away        that night i saw not judas  the next day     ghastly  clay white  a shadow of a man     with robes all soiled and torn  and tangled beard     into the chamber where the council sat    came feebly staggering  scarce should i have known     twas judas  with that haggard  blasted face     so had that night s great horror altered him     as one all blindly walking in a dream    he to the table came  against it leaned      glared wildly round a while  then  stretching forth     from his torn robes  a trembling hand  flung down     as if a snake had stung him  a small purse     that broke and scattered its white coins about     and  with a shrill voice  cried   take back the purse     twas not for that foul dross i did the deed       twas not for that  oh  horror  not for that     but that i did believe he was the lord     and that he is the lord i still believe     but oh  the sin   the sin  i have betrayed    the innocent blood  and i am lost   am lost      so crying  round his face his robes he threw     and blindly rushed away  and we  aghast     looked round  and no one for a moment spoke        seeing that face  i could but fear the end     for death was in it  looking through his eyes     nor could i follow to arrest the fate    that drove him madly on with scorpion whip        at last the duty of the day was done     and night came on  forth from the gates i went     anxious and pained by many a dubious thought     to seek for judas  and to comfort him     the sky was dark with heavy lowering clouds     a lifeless  stifling air weighed on the world     a dreadful silence like a nightmare lay    crouched on its bosom  waiting  grim and grey     in horrible suspense of some dread thing     a creeping sense of death  a sickening smell     infected the dull breathing of the wind     a thrill of ghosts went by me now and then     and made my flesh creep as i wandered on     at last i came to where a cedar stretched    its black arms out beneath a dusky rock     and  passing through its shadow  all at once    i started  for against the dubious light    a dark and heavy mass that to and fro    slung slowly with its weight  before me grew     a sick dread sense came over me  i stopped      i could not stir  a cold and clammy sweat    oozed out all over me  and all my limbs     bending with tremulous weakness like a child s     gave way beneath me  then a sense of shame    aroused me  i advanced  stretched forth my hand    and pushed the shapeless mass  and at my touch    it yielding swung  the branch above it creaked      and back returning struck against my face     a human body  was it dead or not     swiftly my sword i drew and cut it down     and on the sand all heavily it dropped     i plucked the robes away  exposed the face       twas judas  as i feared  cold  stiff  and dead     that suffering heart of his had ceased to beat        thus lysias spoke  and ended  i confess    this story of poor judas touched me much     what horrible revulsions must have passed    across that spirit in those few last hours     what storms  that tore up life even to its roots     say what you will  grant all the guilt  and still    what pangs of dread remorse  what agonies    of desperate repentance  all too late     in that wild interval between the crime    and its last sad atonement   life  the while     laden with horror all too great to bear     and pressing madly on to death s abyss     this was no common mind that thus could feel      no vulgar villain sinning for reward        was  he a villain lost to sense of shame     ay  so say john and peter and the rest     and yet  and yet this tale that lysias tells    weighs with me more the more i ponder it     for thus i put it  either judas was     as john affirms  a villain and a thief     a creature lost to shame and base at heart      or else  which is the view that lysias takes     he was a rash and visionary man    whose faith was firm  who had no thought of crime     but whom a terrible mistake drove mad     take but john s view  and all to me is blind     call him a villain who  with greed of gain     for thirty silver pieces sold his lord     does not the bribe seem all too small and mean     he held the common purse  and  were he thief     had daily power to steal  and lay aside    a secret and accumulating fund     so doing  he had nothing risked of fame     while here he braved the scorn of all the world     besides  why chose they for their almoner    a man so lost to shame  so foul with greed     or why  from some five score of trusted men     choose him as one apostle among twelve     or why  if he were known to be so vile      and who can hide his baseness at all times      keep him in close communion to the last     naught in his previous life  or acts  or words     shows this consummate villain that  full grown     leaps all at once to such a height of crime       again  how comes it that this wretch  whose heart    is eased to shame  flings back the paltry bribe     and  when he knows his master is condemned     rushes in horror out to seek his death     whose fingers pointed at him in the crowd     did all men flee his presence till he found    life too intolerable  nay  not so     death came too close upon the heels of crime     he had but done what all his tribe deemed just     all the great mass  i mean the upper class      the rabbis  all the pharisees and priests    ay  and the lower mob as well who cried      give us barabbas  christus to the cross      these men were all of them on judas s side     and judas had done naught against the law     were he this villain  he had but to say      i followed christus till i found at last    he aimed at power to overthrow the state     i did the duty of an honest man     i traitor  you are traitors who reprove      besides  such villains scorn the world s reproof       or he might say   you call this act a crime     what crime was it to say i know this man     i said no ill of him  if crime there be      twas yours who doomed him unto death  not mine      a villain was he  so barabbas was     but did barabbas go and hang himself     weary of life  the murderer and thief     this coarse and vulgar way will never do     grant him a villain  all his  acts must be    acts of a villain  if you once admit    remorse so bitter that it leads to death     and death so instant on the heels of crime     you grant a spirit sensitive to shame     so sensitive that life can yield no joys    to counterbalance one bad act   but then    a nature such as this  though led astray     when greatly tempted  is no thorough wretch     was the temptation great  could such a bribe    tempt such a nature to a crime like this     i say  to me it simply seems absurd     peter at least was not so sensitive     he cursed and swore  denying that he knew    who the man christus was  but after all    he only wept  he never hanged himself       but take the other view that lysias takes     all is at once consistent  clear  complete     firm in the faith that christus was his god    the great messiah sent to save the world     he  seeking for a sign  not for himself     but to show proof to all that he was god    conceived this plan  rash if you will  but grand      thinking him man   he said   mere mortal man     they seek to seize him  i will make pretence    to take the public bribe and point him out     and they shall go  all armed with swords and staves     strong with the power of law  to seize on him      and at their touch he  god himself  shall stand    revealed before them  and their swords drop     and prostrate all before him shall adore     and cry   behold the lord and king of all       but when the soldiers laid their hands on him    and bound him as they would a prisoner vile     with taunts  and mockery  and threats of death      he all the while submitting  then his dream    burst into fragments with a crash  aghast    the whole world reeled before him  the dread truth    swooped like a sea upon him  bearing down    his thoughts in wild confusion  he who dreamed    to open the gates of glory to his lord     opened in their stead the prison s jarring door     and saw above him his dim dream of love    change to a fury stained with blood and crime     and then a madness seized him  and remorse    with pangs of torture drove him down to death       conceive with me that sad and suffering heart    if this be true that lysias says  conceive     alas  orestes  not so sad thy fate     for the apollo pardoned  purified      thy furies were appeased  thy peace returned     but judas perished tortured unto death     unpardoned  unappeased  unpurified     and long as christus shall be known of men    his name shall bear the brand of infamy     the curse of generations still unborn       thus much of him  i leave the question here     touching on naught beyond  for lucius waits      i hear him fuming in the court below     cursing his servants and jerusalem     and giving them to the infernal gods     the sun is sinking  all the sky s afire      and vale and mountain glow like molten ore    in the intense full splendor of its rays     a half hour hence all will be dull and grey     and lucius only waits until the shade    sweeps down the plain then mounts and makes his way    on through the blinding desert to the sea     and thence his galley bears him on to rome        salve et vale    may good fortune wait    on you and all your household  greet for me    titus and livia  in a word  all friends                       ii     prohibition banishes crime      naturally  i am not a prohibitionist  nevertheless  i dispute the  contention of the brewers that they did not oppose but  instead   actually approved the enactment of the recent  bone dry  prohibition  legislation forbidding transportation of alcoholic beverages into  states which prohibit the sale and manufacture of intoxicants  on  the ground that its drastic measure would have a  reactionary effect   and thus result in the return of a number of the present  dry  states  into the  wet  column   vaporings of this sort sound very much like  the old sour grape story and have their origin in the fertile brain  of the publicity manager of the beer trust     absence of drunkenness  law and order  and the reduction of crime  to a minimum  have invariably followed the  dry  wave     prohibition has emptied the jails  and the people are gratified  with the new order of things   everybody is happy except the  liquor interests     a town in georgia  having no further use for its jail  not having  had an occupant for a long time as the result of the bone dry law   has rented it out for another purpose     the most remarkable proof comes from the national capital   washington  became saloonless on november           during the month of november  the  first dry month  official figures made public by the commissioners   comparing arrests for drunkenness during november        and the same  month a year ago  show that during november            arrests for  drunkenness were made  as against     for november        a reduction  of      or    per cent   the greatest number of arrests for any one  week in november        were     while the greatest number for the  same period a year ago were         in decatur  ill   which went  dry  four years ago  the population  has increased from        to          it is claimed that the criminal  cases have lessened    per cent  that the building of factories  and houses has increased    per cent  that       savings depositors  in banks were added and that there were    per cent less cases of  public charity yearly     nor will the loss of revenue permanently affect conditions   the  enormous wealth of the country will soon adjust that phase of the  situation     authorities assert there is no license city that keeps within its  budget  whereas there is no dry city that is not financially  improved by the ousting of the brewers           chapter iii     what is beer       in the well known european beer drinking countries nothing but hops  and malt are permitted in brewing     here beer is a concoction of corn  rice  hops  malt  glucose   preservatives and other drugs  and  in most cases  it has nothing  in common with real beer other than its artificial foam and color     a leader of public opinion made the statement in the united states  senate that  beer that is brewed in this country is slop   they say  it is  good for the health   i never saw a man who drank it who was  not a candidate for bright s disease or paralysis      mr  j  frank hanly  editor of the national enquirer  indianapolis    and former governor of indiana says   nor will the people be deceived  by the fallacious contention that beer is a safe and harmless drink   every laboratory in america refutes it   every sociologist knows  better   every scientist of reputation condemns it   the management  of every great industrial interest  compelled by economic necessity   seeks its complete overthrow            the average beer drinker consumes more alcohol than the average  whiskey drinker            chapter iv     non alcoholic beer is a mysterious compound of drugs      numerous processes are now in use for making non alcoholic beer  and the ingredients used are usually cloaked in deep mystery     in a recently patented process for the production of non alcoholic  beer it is admitted that salt  gum arabic  quassia  a pepsin compound  and meta bisulphite of potassium  or another suitable drug  are some  of the materials used in brewing the non alcoholic product           chapter v     beer is a habit forming drug      eminent physicians ridicule the claim of the brewers that beer   even assuming that it were pure and unadulterated  and entirely  free from poisonous drugs and chemicals  is a beverage of high  food value and ranks with milk as a blood producer     a bulletin issued by the department of health of the city of new york  in relation to the question of alcohol as food states that ten cents  worth of beer provides     calories of food energy  while ten cents  worth of oatmeal will provide       calories     there is no question that the indulgence in beer is merely an  acquired habit   to those who have not cultivated it  its taste  is generally repugnant     total abstinence for a while invariably cures the habit   i have  been told by a number of former strong adherents to the cause of  the brewers  residing in territory now  dry   that even they are  wondering why they ever saturated their systems with beer   physicians  condemn its use and claim that the widespread idea that alcohol is  a stimulant is wrong   beer is fast becoming an outcast     fresh fruit juices  notably grape juice and apple cider  and other  satisfying beverages  well flavored  with a considerable food value   are daily growing more popular and will take the place of beer           to rid the saloon of crime and vice would decrease the sale of beer            chapter vi     why beer is not a fit drink for the home      the alcoholic content of beer has been about four per cent   the  alcoholic content of the quality of whiskey generally sold over  the bar is about forty per cent  and  frequently much less   it  can therefore be readily seen that the quantity of alcohol contained  in a large glass of beer  even with the recent slightly reduced  alcoholic content  is equivalent to about that contained in an  ordinary drink of whiskey  which is sufficient to intoxicate any  person not accustomed to its use     it is nothing unusual  even in the case of confirmed drinkers  to  feel at times the intoxicating effect of a single glass of beer   especially when taken upon an empty stomach or when the system may  not just be in proper condition     brewers are recommending beer to expectant and nursing mothers and  as a fit drink for the home   but  on the other hand  they prefer  to employ men who have not acquired the beer drinking habit     the most valuable men advocating the  wet  cause fight shy of beer   they know what it is made of   many saloonkeepers never touch it   nor will they employ bartenders unless they are total abstainers           if the saloons and other public drinking places were ousted   but the breweries permitted to operate  drunkenness  crime and  vice would invade the home            chapter vii     beer is not a temperance drink      it can not be denied that people drink beer for its alcoholic  effect  and that most of the intoxication is caused by beer     brewers claim that beer is a  true temperance drink   but they  are careful to add  if taken in moderate quantities     if beer were ever consumed in moderate quantities it would result  in a fifty per cent reduction of the beer output of the country   it would force most of the brewers out of business  and i doubt  if any saloon could earn enough money to pay the rent of the place   for that reason brewers can not afford to encourage the enactment  of laws abolishing  treating   despite their public statements that  they are in favor of its suppression     in discussing the question with an acquaintance whom i know to be  a very moderate drinker of beer only  he advanced the much heard  argument that a glass of beer will harm no one   he said that he  occasionally dropped into a saloon to take a glass of beer   when  i asked him if  when he had gone into a saloon he had ever run  across some friends and  to be a good fellow  he had been obliged  to take a number of glasses  he replied  yes   and that they had  made him drunk         brewers can not afford to abolish  treating             chapter viii     the decreased alcoholic content of beer will increase drunkenness      the decree of president wilson that beer brewed henceforth in the  united states during the pendency of the war shall not contain more  than      per cent alcohol by weight  which is equivalent to      per cent by volume  footnote   this does not include ale and  porter  the alcoholic content of which is permitted to remain  considerably in excess of that of beer    and that the amount of  grain used in its manufacture shall be reduced to approximately  seventy per cent of the volume used heretofore  will not decrease  intoxication  but it has caused intense jubilation among the  brewers   they pronounce it a great victory over the  dry  forces   and they have lost no time in again broadly proclaiming the virtues  of their product and its  food  value     the slightly reduced alcoholic content of beer will still be ample  to produce a high state of intoxication if  as is usually the case   it is consumed immoderately   in substantiation of my contention i  need but cite the irrefutable fact that a barrel of beer holding     gallons would still contain a whole gallon of alcohol     where the great danger lies is that the widely heralded reduction  of the alcoholic content and the claim of the brewers that beer  is now to be classed as a true temperance drink will tend to greatly  deceive the public and thus largely increase its consumption  in  most cases to cause  the same intoxicating effect as before      besides  it has already become a common practice among many misguided  drinkers to produce the desired  kick  by pouring whiskey  and even  plain alcohol into the beer     in my opinion  therefore  the reduced alcoholic content will make  the consumption of beer still more harmful than before  because   instead of diminishing drunkenness  it will have the opposite  effect  and the brewers will be the big gainers because the new  order of things will not only largely increase their output  but  it will also reduce the cost of production without cutting the  selling price   and  by reason of their increased output  they  will use the same amount of grain as before     even with the reduced alcoholic content the beer drinker will consume  more alcohol than the whiskey drinker           chapter ix     brewers  grains are considered dangerous for cows milk      as an argument against the extermination of the breweries the claim  is made that a part of the grain used in brewing is converted into  a cattle feed which is a great  milk producer      brewers  grains are the residue of barley malt and corn grits   they consist principally of barley hulls     corn stalks are also fed to cattle  but they have very little  food value without a considerable addition of whole grain   brewers   grains  as a milk producer  are a very poor substitute for the  grain from which beer is brewed     authorities claim that brewers  grains produce functional disturbances  and disease in the cow  and milk from such cows is not safe for infants     brewers  grains are not allowed to be used for the cows that yield milk  and butter for copenhagen  the capital of the country that leads  the world in dairy farming         the closing of the breweries can alone remove the objectionable  conditions inseparable from the beer traffic            chapter x     brewers assault distillers to hide their own crimes      a nation wide campaign has been set in motion by the brewers to  beguile the public by assaulting the distillers     distillers rarely sell direct to saloons as the brewers do     distillers do not own or back saloons     distillers are therefore not responsible for the lawless conditions  of which the public complains  nor were they ever accused of stuffing  the ballot box     whiskey leaves the distillery in an unadulterated condition  while  beer is drugged at the brewery     the average beer drinker consumes more alcohol than the average  whiskey drinker     the national advocate  new york  maintains that  beer is a greater  peril to manhood  home and society than whiskey ever has been or  can be      are the attacks upon the distillers merely a ruse to conceal the  fact that officers  directors and thousands of stockholders of the  largest brewing companies in all parts of the country are either  wholesale or retail whiskey dealers  or saloon keepers  or both     if the brewers are sincere in their promise to divorce beer from  whiskey  why have they not closed their own whiskey stores     why have they not placed a ban upon the sale of whiskey in all the  saloons which they own and operate themselves     why have they not forbidden the sale of whiskey in all saloons   what is there to prevent it     is it not a fact that  with few exceptions  the so called owners  of saloons  not operated by brewers themselves  are merely slaves  of the brewers  the latter owning either the property or the lease   the license and a chattel mortgage upon the fixtures in the place     the truth is that a saloon keeper can not exist if his business  should be restricted to the sale of beer  and the closing of a  saloon means a loss to the brewer     i quote here again from an editorial written by mr  j  frank hanly   former governor of indiana  which appeared in the national enquirer   indianapolis   of which he is the editor  as follows      when the writer of this editorial was a candidate for the nomination  for governor of the state of indiana it was not the distilling  interests of the state  but the brewers  that sought to wring from  him a promise that in consideration for his nomination he should  if  elected  permit no temperance legislation during his term   it was  the brewing interests of indiana  not the distillers  that sought  on the eve of election  after his nomination in spite of their  opposition  to extort a like promise as the price of his election      it was the president of the indiana brewers  association  and not  a representative of the distillery interests of the state  that  walked into the governor s office in indianapolis  and with the  arrogance of a hun announced that he had come to say to the governor  that a township and ward remonstrance law which the governor had  recommended to the general assembly for enactment could not be  passed by the legislature              in all the history of the political and civil life of the american  people there has been no combination or organization of power so  brutal  so domineering  so corrupt  or so dead to every sense of  civic interest or concern as the brewers of america  they have been  and are the chief criminals  and no camouflage to which they may  resort will save them   the people will see beneath the false  pretense the bare  naked facts   the legislatures of the states  will be organized into firing squads  and the beer trade will be  compelled to meet its fate            chapter xi     abolition of crime and vice would decrease the sale of beer      because brewers control the saloons  it is also within their power  to suppress  treating   stop the operation of disorderly hotels  and private drinking rooms in conjunction with saloons  stop  bookmaking and other forms of gambling  in short  remove any and  all of the undesirable features connected with the saloon which  are objected to by the public  but any serious disturbance with  existing conditions would decrease the sale of beer           chapter xii     crime is planned in saloons      the brewers know that the saloons are the meeting places of  lawbreakers and disreputables  that they enter the side doors  leading to private rooms where burglaries  holdups and other crimes  are planned and the booty is divided  yet  brewers will make no real  effort to improve these conditions     is it surprising that the public is clamoring for the complete  elimination of the breweries           chapter xiii     the beer traffic does not recognize the sanctity of the home      on the other hand  if the saloons and other public drinking places  were ousted but the breweries permitted to operate  drunkenness   crime and vice would invade the home     if the people are determined to remove the objectionable elements  inseparable from the beer traffic  they must close the breweries           chapter xiv     a vice complaint      the juvenile protective association of chicago filed the following  complaint with the chief of police      schoenhofen s hall     one of the waiters serving drinks was no older than    years   at  midnight this boy was sitting at one of the tables half asleep  trying to support a drunken man   fifty minors were illegally present   ten minors drank intoxicants   three minors were intoxicated   twenty soldiers were drinking intoxicants   about fifteen soldiers  were intoxicated   one of the soldiers dancing was so drunk that  the girl could hardly hold him up   there were four instances of  kissing  five of embracing  three of improper handling  and one fight       the peter schoenhofen brewing company operates the largest brewery  in chicago         illustration  an every day vice scene        blank page           chapter xv     laws are openly violated      i want to say here  however  that not all the brewers are as black  as they are painted   there are some among them who are clean and  honest men who  bitterly resent the lawless methods of their colleagues     upon the request of the respectable element i have frequently  warned the brewers of the country that nothing could save their  industry unless they made up their minds to become law abiding  citizens and stop fooling the people     i have warned them on many occasions that they had no right to  enlist the sympathy of the people as long as they persisted in  defying the laws enacted by the people  but my warnings fell upon  deaf ears     what can cause greater hostility toward the brewers than the fact  that midnight closing and sunday laws are openly violated with their  knowledge and connivance and that political influence and the liberal  use of money will gain them immunity from prosecution     has it not frequently been said that the  dough bags  of the brewers  control the courts and influence their decisions         absence of drunkenness  law and order  and the reduction of  crime to a minimum  have invariably followed the  dry  wave            chapter xvi     another vice backed by brewers        cabarets  and tango dance resorts      how little my advice was heeded was clearly shown by  the appearance  of a comparatively new vice  openly aided and abetted by brewers  which  in a few years has spread its poisonous tentacles to all parts  of the country   i refer to      cabarets and tango dance resorts      what more can inflame the mind of the public against the brewers  than these vulgar and liquor flowing twentieth century dives   especially when the fact is considered that many of these gilded  hells are owned and operated by brewers themselves     in many european cities similar resorts are classed among houses  of ill repute and the same police regulations are applied to them   here  they are brazenly advertised as  afternoon teas  to lure  the unwary     in my travels i have visited many of the most prominently  advertised places of this kind in different parts of the country  to study the habitues     it can not be denied that most of these dives are the rendezvous  of the demimonde  breeding places of vice  crime and degeneracy   and an ally of the white slave traffic     they are keeping the divorce mills busy   their glitter has led  astray  caused the disappearance of and has driven to suicide  innumerable young women  particularly from among those who have  come from rural districts to seek employment in large cities   they have made criminals of many young men because their salaries  would not permit them to lead the fast life of their newly made friends     the principal source of profit to the keepers of these dives is   of course  the sale of alcoholic drinks  in most cases grossly  adulterated despite the unreasonable prices exacted for same     female performers are frequently expected to drink with the patrons   usually these women are paid a commission on the drinks they can  persuade their dupes to purchase     scenes of indecency are openly indulged in by both sexes as the  result of the excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks     a recent development of the cabaret is the  hostess    her duty  is to  introduce  men and girls   in many instances hotels of  questionable character are operated as an adjunct to these places     the managers of a number of large hotels which have built up a  reputation for respectability and exclusiveness have long ago seen  the handwriting on the wall and therefore wisely placed a ban upon  this evil   ladies refuse to stop at hotels that attract an undesirable  element by the operation of cabarets and present day dances     the fact that many of these places which are owned and operated  by brewers themselves continue in full blast again discredits the  statements of their press agents that  the cabaret must go      will the brewers continue their policy of defying the people until  nation wide prohibition will put a stop to these drunken orgies       how a new york brewer advertises his cabaret resort      the following advertisement appeared in       the new york times         illustration   john reisenweber  the keeper of

    united states brewers  association exposed      i have also many times urged the brewers to break away from their  national organization  the united states brewers  association  also  known as the brewers trust  because i felt convinced that  they would sooner or later lay themselves open to exposure and  criminal prosecution  and that it would further increase the  hostility toward their industry if they should persist in their  attempts to defeat the prohibition movement by the expenditure  of money in corrupting elections  legislation and public officials     political contributions amounting to many millions of dollars   based upon the annual output of brewers throughout the country   are turned into their association     other enormous sums are collected from those who sell to brewers   they are expected to join a  league of manufacturers and dealers   organized to fight prohibition   from invoices rendered to brewers  for goods purchased a certain amount is retained     officials of the united states brewers  association declare that  checkbooks  bank passbooks  checks  stubs and correspondence are  destroyed monthly  and that the only record left is the money the  association has in bank     that my warnings were justified was amply proven when  not long ago   the large brewing companies in the state of texas were indicted  charging them with the distribution of many millions of dollars to  promote anti prohibition legislation and the payment of the poll  taxes of thousands of persons so that they could vote against  prohibition   all of these breweries except one pleaded guilty  to the charges against them and paid penalties aggregating            also expenses incurred by the attorney general s office  totaling  about          and the court costs  and they accepted an injunction  restraining them from violating the state anti trust laws and  contributing to political campaigns in the future     one hundred large brewing companies in the state of pennsylvania   and officers of the united states brewers  association  were  indicted by a federal grand jury  charging conspiracy in the  unlawful expenditure of money to influence elections at which  votes for federal officials were cast     the office of the united states brewers  association in the city  of new york was raided and its files were seized   the secretary  of the association was committed to jail     it was alleged that these brewers raised and spent a fund exceeding              to influence the election of a united states senator  and thirty six members of the lower house of congress and to pervert  to selfish and sordid purposes the government of the nation     the united states attorney charged in court that these brewers had  boasted in their circulars of their ability to poison the ranks of  organized labor through labor unions  to kill at one session of  congress two hundred bills inimical to the liquor interests  and  to capture entire states at elections     fines aggregating         were imposed upon thirty three of these  brewing companies  the united states brewers  association was fined           the maximum amount possible under the federal law     federal authorities have hinted at a nation wide traffic in election  corruption   intimations have come from the same source that similar  indictments may be handed down against brewers in all parts of the country     but even the scandalous exposures in texas and pennsylvania will not  stop their interference with elections     the truth is that the very nature of the business of the brewers  makes it imperative that they retain a strong hold on the ballot  box   by those methods alone have they been able to exist in the  past   by those methods alone can they hope to save themselves     in new york  new jersey and pennsylvania  the mere suggestion to  keepers of saloons  hotels and other places where liquor is sold  that the  dry  wave may soon put them out of business usually  brings forth the reply   our state will never go  dry    the brewers  have too much money   they can buy all the votes required  as well  as public officials  to kill any legislation hostile to them            chapter xviii     how chicago brewers have  tried to prevent a  dry   vote      in chicago  heretofore considered by the brewers one of their  greatest strongholds  in order to enable the people to vote whether  the city shall remain  wet  or become  dry   the law requires the  filing of a petition with a certain number of signatures  but the  brewers opposed even the right of the people to vote upon this  important question and in glaring advertisements boldly advised  them to withhold their signatures     attempts were also made to intimidate the circulators of the  petitions by threatening them with prosecution for perjury unless  they personally knew that all the signers were registered voters     in spite of these methods          signatures were obtained          more than the         names required under the law     attempts made by politicians to defer the election for a year on  the plea of  economy  were also unsuccessful   in many quarters  same was branded as another ruse on the part of the brewers to  prevent a  dry  vote         the beer traffic does not recognize the sanctity of the home            chapter xix     brewers fear  woman suffrage      women know that the abolition of the beer traffic will prevent  their children from becoming drunkards and criminals     women know that the abolition of the beer traffic means a full

spent the greater part of their  earnings in saloons have  since the advent of the  dry  wave   invested their savings in a house and lot  and in a few years  were able to pay off the entire indebtedness  and now are masters  of their own home     that s the reason why brewers greatly fear the votes of women and  why they consider woman suffrage the stepping stone to prohibition           chapter xx     people resent government by  the brewers      it is not the beer traffic alone  but the social and political  crimes of the brewers  which is leading to rapid prohibitory laws  all over the country     people resent government by the brewers   people resent the election  of legislators and other public officials  city  state and national   to serve ends hostile to social decency  to rule by the people  to  the very life of the nation                       peat mosses about the river mouths  marked here  and there by lines of weather beaten trees  or by more solid dots of  black which the eye of the inhabitant knew to be peat stacks  beyond the  mosses were level lines of greyish white  where the looping rivers passed  into the sea  lines more luminous than the sky at this particular moment  of a damp march afternoon  because of some otherwise invisible radiance   which  miles away  seemed to be shining upon the water  slipping down to  it from behind a curtain of rainy cloud     nearer by  on either side of the high road which cut the valley from east  to west  were black and melancholy fields  half reclaimed from the peat  moss  fields where the water stood in the furrows  or a plough driven  deep and left  showed the nature of the heavy waterlogged earth  and the  farmer s despair of dealing with it  till the drying winds should come   some of it  however  had long before been reclaimed for pasture  so that  strips of sodden green broke up  here and there  the long stretches of  purple black  in the great dykes or drains to which the pastures were  due  the water  swollen with recent rain  could be seen hurrying to join  the rivers and the sea  the clouds overhead hurried like the dykes and  the streams  a perpetual procession from the north west swept inland from  the sea  pouring from the dark distance of the upper valley  and blotting  out the mountains that stood around its head     a desolate scene  on this wild march day  yet full of a sort of beauty   even so far as the mosslands were concerned  and as alan helbeck s glance  travelled along the ridge to his right  he saw it gradually rising from  the marsh in slopes  and scars  and wooded fells  a medley of lovely  lines  of pastures and copses  of villages clinging to the hills  each  with its church tower and its white spreading farms  a laud of homely  charm and comfort  gently bounding the marsh below it  and cut off by the  seething clouds in the north west from the mountains towards which it  climbed  and as he turned homewards with the moss country behind him  the  hills rose and fell about him in soft undulation more and more rich in  wood  while beside him roared the tumbling greet  with its flood voice  a  voice more dear and familiar to alan helbeck perhaps  at this moment of  his life  than the voice of any human being     he walked fast with his shoulders thrown back  a remarkably tall man   with a dark head and short grizzled beard  he held himself very erect  as  a soldier holds himself  but he had never been a soldier     once in his rapid course  he paused to look at his watch  then hurried  on  thinking      she stipulates that she is never to be expected to come to prayers   he  repeated to himself  half smiling   i suppose she thinks of herself as  representing her father  in a nest of papists  evidently augustina has no  chance with her  she has been accustomed to reign  well  we shall let her   gang her gait       his mouth  which was full and strongly closed  took a slight expression  of contempt  as he turned over a bridge  and then into his own gate on  the further side  he passed an old labourer who was scraping the mud from  the road      have you seen any carriage go by just lately  reuben       noa    said the man   theer s been none this last hour an more  nobbut  carts  an t  whinthrupp bus      helbeck s pace slackened  he had been very solitary all day  and even the  company of the old road sweeper was welcome      if we don t get some drying days soon  it ll be bad for all of us  won t  it  reuben       aye  it s a bit clashy   said the man  with stolidity  stopping to spit  into his hands a moment  before resuming his work     the mildness of the adjective brought another half smile to helbeck s  dark face  a stranger watching it might have wondered  indeed  whether it  could smile with any fulness or spontaneity      but you don t see any good in grumbling  is that it       noa  we se not git ony profit that gate  i reckon   said the old man   laying his scraper to the mud once more      well  good night to you  i m expecting my sister to night  you know  my  sister mrs  fountain  and her stepdaughter       eh   said reuben slowly   then yo ll be hevin cumpany  fer shure   good neet to ye  misther helbeck      but there was no great cordiality in his tone  and he touched his cap  carelessly  without any sort of unction  the man s manner expressed  familiarity of long habit  but little else     helbeck turned into his own park  the road that led up to the house wound  alongside the river  whereof the banks had suddenly risen into a craggy  wildness  all recollection of the marshland was left behind  the ground  mounted on either side of the stream towards fell tops  of which the  distant lines could be seen dimly here and there behind the crowding  trees  while  at some turns of the road  where the course of the greet  made a passage for the eye  one might look far away to the same mingled  blackness of cloud and scar that stood round the head of the estuary   clearly the mountains were not far off  and this was a border country  between their ramparts and the sea     the light of the march evening was dying  dying in a stormy greyness that  promised more rain for the morrow  yet the air was soft  and the spring  made itself felt  in some sheltered places by the water  one might  already see a shimmer of buds  and in the grass of the wild untended  park  daffodils were springing  helbeck was conscious of it all  his eye  and ear were on the watch for the signs of growth  and for the birds that  haunted the river  the dipper on the stone  the grey wagtail slipping to  its new nest in the bank  the golden crested wren  or dark backed creeper  moving among the thorns  he loved such things  though with a silent and  jealous love that seemed to imply some resentment towards other things  and forces in his life     as he walked  the manner of the old peasant rankled a little in his  memory  for it implied  if not disrespect  at least a complete absence of  all that the french call  consideration       it s strange how much more alone i ve felt in this place of late than i  used to feel   was helbeck s reflection upon it  at last   i reckon it s  since i sold the leasowes land  or is it perhaps         he fell into a reverie marked by a frowning expression  and a harsh  drawing down of the mouth  but gradually as he swung along  muttered  words began to escape him  and his hand went to a book that he carried in  his pocket     o dust  learn of me to obey  learn of me  o earth and  clay  to humble thyself  and to cast thyself under the feet of all men  for the love of me     as he murmured the words  which soon became  inaudible  his aspect cleared  his eyes raised themselves again to the  landscape  and became once more conscious of its growth and life     presently he reached a gate across the road  where a big sheepdog sprang  out upon him  leaping and barking joyously  beyond the gates rose a low  pile of buildings  standing round three sides of a yard  they had once  been the stables of the hall  now they were put to farm uses  and through  the door of what had formerly been a coachhouse with a coat of arms  worked in white pebbles on its floor  a woman could be seen milking   helbeck looked in upon her      no carriage gone by yet  mrs  tyson       noa  sir   said the woman   but i ll mebbe prop t  gate open  for it s  aboot time   and she put down her pail      don t move   said helbeck hastily   i ll do it myself      the woman  as she milked  watched him propping the ruinous gate with a  stone  her expression all the time friendly and attentive  his own  people  women especially  somehow always gave him this attention     helbeck hurried forward over a road  once stately  and now badly worn and  ill mended  the trees  mostly oaks of long growth  which had accompanied  him since the entrance of the park  thickened to a close wood around till  of a sudden he emerged from them  and there  across a wide space  rose a  grey gabled house  sharp against a hillside  with a rainy evening light  full upon it     it was an old and weather beaten house  of a singular character and  dignity  yet not large  it was built of grey stone  covered with a  rough cast  so tempered by age to the colour and surface of the stone   that the many patches where it had dropped away produced hardly any  disfiguring effect  the rugged  pele  tower  origin and source of all the  rest  was now grouped with the gables and projections  the broad  casemented windows  and deep doorways of a tudor manor house  but the  whole structure seemed still to lean upon and draw towards the tower  and  it was the tower which gave accent to a general expression of austerity   depending perhaps on the plain simplicity of all the approaches and  immediate neighbourhood of the house  for in front of it were neither  flowers nor shrubs  only wide stretches of plain turf and gravel  while  behind it  beyond some thin intervening trees  rose a grey limestone  fell  into which the house seemed to withdraw itself  as into the rock    whence it was hewn      there were some lights in the old windows  and the heavy outer door was  open  helbeck mounted the steps and stood  watch in hand  at the top of  them  looking down the avenue he had just walked through  and very soon   in spite of the roar of the river  his ear distinguished the wheels he  was listening for  while they approached  he could not keep himself  still  but moved restlessly about the little stone platform  he had been  solitary for many years  and had loved his solitude      they re just coomin   sir   said the voice of his old housekeeper  as  she threw open an inner door behind him  letting a glow of fire and  candles stream out into the twilight  helbeck meanwhile caught sight for  an instant of a girl s pale face at the window of the approaching  carriage  a face thrust forward eagerly  to gaze at the pele tower     the horses stopped  and out sprang the girl      wait a moment  let me help you  augustina  how do you do  mr  helbeck   don t touch my dog  please  he doesn t like men  fricka  be quiet      for the little black spitz she held in a chain had begun to growl and  bark furiously at the first sight of helbeck  to the evident anger of the  old housekeeper  who looked at the dog sourly as she went forward to take  some bags and rugs from her master  helbeck  meanwhile  and the young  girl helped another lady to alight  she came out slowly with the  precautions of an invalid  and helbeck gave her his arm     at the top of the steps she turned and looked round her      oh  alan   she said   it is so long         her lips trembled  and her head shook oddly  she was a short woman  with  a thin plaintive face and a nervous jerk of the head  always very marked  at a moment of agitation  as he noticed it  helbeck felt times long past  rush back upon him  he laid his hand over hers  and tried to say  something  but his shyness oppressed him  when he had led her into the  broad hall  with its firelight and stuccoed roof  she said  turning round  with the same bewildered air       you saw laura  you have never seen her before       oh yes  we shook hands  augustina   said a young voice   will mr   helbeck please help me with these things      she was laden with shawls and packages  and helbeck hastily went to her  aid  in the emotion of bringing his sister back into the old house  which  she had left fifteen years before  when he himself was a lad of  two and twenty  he had forgotten her stepdaughter     but miss fountain did not intend to be forgotten  she made him relieve  her of all burdens  and then argue an overcharge with the flyman  and at  last  when all the luggage was in and the fly was driving off  she  mounted the steps deliberately  looking about her all the time  but  principally at the house  the eyes of the housekeeper  who with mr   helbeck was standing in the entrance awaiting her  surveyed both dog and  mistress with equal disapproval     but the dusk was fast passing into darkness  and it was not till the girl  came into the brightness of the hall where her stepmother was already  sitting tired and drooping on a settle near the great wood fire  that  helbeck saw her plainly     she was very small and slight  and her hair made a spot of pale gold  against the oak panelling of the walls  helbeck noticed the slenderness  of her arms  and the prettiness of her little white neck  then the  freedom of her quick gesture as she went up to the elder lady and with a  certain peremptoriness began to loosen her cloak      augustina ought to go to bed directly   she said  looking at helbeck    the journey tired her dreadfully       mrs  fountain s room is quite ready   said the housekeeper  holding  herself stiffly behind her master  she was a woman of middle age  with a  pinkish face  framed between two tiers of short grey curls     laura s eye ran over her       you  don t like our coming   she said to herself  then to helbeck       may i take her up at once  i will unpack  and put her comfortable  then  she ought to have some food  she has had nothing to day but some tea at  lancaster      mrs  fountain looked up at the girl with feeble acquiescence  as though  depending on her entirely  helbeck glanced from his pale sister to the  housekeeper in some perplexity      what will you have   he said nervously to miss fountain   dinner  i  think  was to be at a quarter to eight       that was the time i was ordered  sir   said mrs  denton      can t it be earlier   asked the girl impetuously     mrs  denton did not reply  but her shoulders grew visibly rigid      do what you can for us  denton   said her master hastily  and she went  away  helbeck bent kindly over his sister      you know what a small establishment we have  augustina  mrs  denton  a  rough girl  and a boy  that s all  i do trust they will be able to make  you comfortable       oh  let me come down  when i have unpacked  and help cook   said miss  fountain brightly   i can do anything of that sort      helbeck smiled for the first time   i am afraid mrs  denton wouldn t take  it kindly  she rules us all in this old place       i dare say   said the girl quietly   it s fish  of course   she added   looking down at her stepmother  and speaking in a meditative voice      it s a friday s dinner   said helbeck  flushing suddenly  and looking at  his sister   except for miss fountain  i supposed         mrs  fountain rose in some agitation and threw him a piteous look      of course you did  alan  of course you did  but the doctor at  folkestone  he was a catholic  i took such care about that   told me i  mustn t fast  and laura is always worrying me  but indeed i didn t want  to be dispensed   not yet      laura said nothing  nor did helbeck  there was a certain embarrassment in  the looks of both  as though there was more in mrs  fountain s words than  appeared  then the girl  holding herself erect and rather defiant  drew  her stepmother s arm in hers  and turned to helbeck      will you please show us the way up      helbeck took a small hand lamp and led the way  bidding the newcomers  beware of the slipperiness of the old polished boards  mrs  fountain  walked with caution  clinging to her stepdaughter  at the foot of the  staircase she stopped  and looked upward      alan  i don t see much change      he turned back  the light shining on his fine harsh face and grizzled  hair      don t you  but it is greatly changed  augustina  we have shut up half of  it      mrs  fountain sighed deeply and moved on  laura  as she mounted the  stairs  looked back at the old hall  its ceiling of creamy stucco  its  panelled walls  and below  the great bare floor of shining oak with  hardly any furniture upon it  a strip of old carpet  a heavy oak table   and a few battered chairs at long intervals against the panelling  but  the big fire of logs piled upon the hearth filled it all with cheerful  light  and under her indifferent manner  the girl s sense secretly  thrilled with pleasure  she had heard much of  poor alan s  poverty   poverty  as far as his house was concerned  at any rate  it seemed to her  of a very tolerable sort                                                 in a few minutes helbeck came downstairs again  and stood absently before  the fire on the hearth  after a while  he sat down beside it in his  accustomed chair  a carved chair of black westmoreland oak  and began to  read from the book which he had been carrying in his pocket out of doors   he read with his head bent closely over the pages  because of short  sight  and  as a rule  reading absorbed him so completely that he was  conscious of nothing external while it lasted  to night  however  he  several times looked up to listen to the sounds overhead  unwonted sounds  in this house  over which  as it often seemed to him  a quiet of  centuries had settled down  like a fine dust or deposit  muffling all its  steps and voices  but there was nothing muffled in the voice overhead  which he caught every now and then  through an open door  escaping  eager  and alive  into the silence  or in the occasional sharp bark of the dog      horrid little wretch   thought helbeck   denton will loathe it   augustina should really have warned me  what shall we do if she and  denton don t get on  it will never answer if she tries meddling in the  kitchen  i must tell her      presently  however  his inner anxieties grew upon him so much that his  book fell on his knee  and he lost himself in a multitude of small  scruples and torments  such as beset all persons who live alone  were all  his days now to be made difficult  because he had followed his  conscience  and asked his widowed sister to come and live with him      augustina and i could have done well enough  but this girl  well  we  must put up with it  we must  bruno      he laid his hand as he spoke on the neck of a collie that had just  lounged into the hall  and come to lay its nose upon his master s knee   suddenly a bark from overhead made the dog start back and prick its ears      come here  bruno  be quiet  you re to treat that little brute with  proper contempt  do you hear  listen to all that scuffling and talking  upstairs  that s the new young woman getting her way with old denton   well  it won t do denton any harm  we re put upon sometimes  too  aren t  we      and he caressed the dog  his haughty face alive with something half  bitter  half humorous     at that moment the old clock in the hall struck a quarter past seven   helbeck sprang up      am i to dress   he said to himself in some perplexity     he considered for a moment or two  looking at his shabby serge suit  then  sat down again resolutely      no  she ll have to live our life  besides  i don t know what denton  would think      and he lay back in his chair  recalling with some amusement the  criticisms of his housekeeper upon a young catholic friend of his  who  rare event  had spent a fishing week with him in the autumn  and had  startled the old house and its inmates with his frequent changes of  raiment   it s yan set o  cloas for breakfast  an anudther for fishin  an  anudther for ridin  an yan for when he cooms in  an a fine suit for  dinner  an anudther fer smoakin  a should think he mut be oftener naked  nor donned   denton had said in her grim westmoreland  and helbeck had  often chuckled over the remark     an hour later  half an hour after the usual time  helbeck  all the traces  of his muddy walk removed  and garbed with scrupulous neatness in the old  black coat and black tie he always wore of an evening  was sitting  opposite to miss fountain at supper      you got everything you wanted for augustina  i hope   he said to her  shyly as they sat down  he had awaited her in the dining room itself  so  as to avoid the awkwardness of taking her in  it was some years since a  woman had stayed under his roof  or since he had been a guest in the same  house with women      oh yes   said miss fountain  but she threw a sly swift glance towards  mrs  denton  who was just coming into the room with some coffee  then  compressed her lips and studied her plate  helbeck detected the glance   and saw too that mrs  denton s pink face was flushed  and her manner  discomposed      the coffee s noa good   she said abruptly  as she put it down   i  couldn t keep to  t       no  i m afraid we disturbed mrs  denton dreadfully   said miss fountain   shrugging her shoulders   we got her to bring up all sorts of things for  augustina  she was dreadfully tired  i thought she would faint  the  doctor scolded me before we left  about letting her go without food   shall i give you some fish  mr  helbeck      for  to her astonishment  the fish even  a very small portion  was placed  before herself  side by side with a few fragments of cold chicken  and  she looked in vain for a second plate     as she glanced across the table  she caught a momentary shade of  embarrassment in helbeck s face      no  thank you   he said   i am provided      his provision seemed to be coffee and bread and butter  she raised her  eyebrows involuntarily  but said nothing  and he presently busied himself  in bringing her vegetables and wine  mrs  denton having left the room      i trust you will make a good meal   he said gravely  as he waited upon  her   you have had a long day       oh  yes   said miss fountain impetuously   and please don t ever make  any difference for me on fridays  it doesn t matter to me in the least  what i eat      helbeck offered no reply  conversation between them indeed did not flow  very readily  they talked a little about the journey from london  and  laura asked a few questions about the house  she was  indeed  studying  the room in which they sat  and her host himself  all the time   he may  be a saint   she thought   but i am sure he knows all the time there are  very few saints of such an old family  his head s splendid  so dark and  fine  with the great waves of grey black hair  and the long features and  the pointed chin  he s immensely tall too  six feet two at least  taller  than father  he looks hard and bigoted  i suppose most people would be  afraid of him  i m not      and as though to prove even to herself she was not  she carried on a  rattle of questions  how old was the tower  how old was the room in which  they were sitting  she looked round it with ignorant  girlish eyes     he pointed her to the date on the carved mantelpiece            that is a very important date for us   he began  then checked himself      why      he seemed to find a difficulty in going on  but at last he said      the man who put up that chimney piece was hanged at manchester later in  the same year       why   what for      he suddenly noticed the delicacy of her tiny wrist as her hand paused at  the edge of her plate  and the brilliance of her eyes  large and  greenish grey  with a marked black line round the iris  the very  perception perhaps made his answer more cold and measured      he was a catholic recusant  under elizabeth  he had harboured a priest   and he and the priest and a friend suffered death for it together at  manchester  afterwards their heads were fixed on the outside of  manchester parish church       how horrible   said miss fountain  frowning   do you know anything more  about him       yes  we have letters         but he would say no more  and the subject dropped  not to let the  conversation also come to an end  he pointed to some old gilded leather  which covered one side of the room  while the other three walls were  oak panelled from ceiling to floor      it is very dim and dingy now   said helbeck   but when it was fresh  it  was the wonder of the place  the room got the name of paradise from it   there are many mentions of it in the old letters       who put it up       the brother of the martyr  twenty years later       the martyr   she thought  half scornfully   no doubt he is as proud of  that as of his twenty generations      he told her a few more antiquarian facts about the room  and its  builders  she meanwhile looking in some perplexity from the rich  embossments of the ceiling with its tudor roses and crowns  from the  stately mantelpiece and canopied doors  to the few pieces of shabby  modern furniture which disfigured the room  the half dozen cane chairs   the ugly lodging house carpet and sideboard  what had become of the old  furnishings  how could they have disappeared so utterly     helbeck  however  did not enlighten her  he talked indeed with no  freedom  merely to pass the time     she perfectly recognised that he was not at ease with her  and she  hurried her meal  in spite of her very frank hunger  that she might set  him free  but  as she was putting down her coffee cup for the last time   she suddenly said      it s a very good air here  isn t it  mr  helbeck       i believe so   he replied  in some surprise   it s a mixture of the sea  and the mountains  everybody here  most of the poor people  live to a  great age       that s all right  then augustina will soon get strong here  she can t do  without me yet  but you know  of course  i have decided  about myself      somehow  as she looked across to her host  her little figure  in its  plain white dress and black ribbons  expressed a curious tension   she  wants to make it very plain to me   thought helbeck   that if she comes  here as my guest  it is only as a favour  to look after my sister      aloud he said      augustina told me she could not hope to keep you for long       no   said the girl sharply   no  i must take up a profession  i have a  little money  you know  from papa  i shall go to cambridge  or to london   perhaps to live with a friend  oh  you darling   you  darling       helbeck opened his eyes in amazement  miss fountain had sprung from her  seat  and thrown herself on her knees beside his old collie bruno  her  arms were round the dog s neck  and she was pressing her cheek against  his brown nose  perhaps she caught her host s look of astonishment  for  she rose at once in a flush of some feeling she tried to put down  and  said  still holding the dog s head against her dress      i didn t know you had a dog like this  it s so like ours  you see  like  papa s  i had to give ours away when we left folkestone  you dear  dear  thing     the caressing intensity in the girl s young voice made helbeck  shrink and turn away    now you won t kill my fricka  will you  she s  curled up  such a delicious black ball  on my bed  you couldn t  you  couldn t have the heart  i ll take you up and introduce you  i ll do  everything proper      the dog looked up at her  with its soft  quiet eyes  as though it weighed  her pleadings      there   she said triumphantly   it s all right  he winked  come along   my dear  and let s make real friends      and she led the dog into the hall  helbeck ceremoniously opening the door  for her     she sat herself down in the oak settle beside the hall fire  where for  some minutes she occupied herself entirely with the dog  talking a sort  of baby language to him that left helbeck absolutely dumb  when she  raised her head  she flung  dartlike  another question at her host      have you many neighbours  mr  helbeck      her voice startled his look away from her      not many   he said  hesitating   and i know little of those there are       indeed  don t you like  society      he laughed with some embarrassment   i don t get much of it   he said  simply      don t you  what a pity   isn t it  bruno  i like society  dreadfully   dances  theatres  parties   all sorts of things  or i  did  once      she paused and stared at helbeck  he did not speak  however  she sat up  very straight and pushed the dog from her   by the way   she said  in a  shrill voice   there are my cousins  the masons  how far are they       about seven miles       quite up in the mountains  isn t it      helbeck assented      oh  i shall go there at once  i shall go tomorrow   said the girl  with  emphasis  resting her small chin lightly on the head of the dog  while  she fixed her eyes  her hostile eyes  upon her host     helbeck made no answer  he went to fetch another log for the fire      why doesn t he say something about them   she thought angrily   why  doesn t he say something about papa   about his illness   ask me any  questions  he may have hated him  but it would be only decent  he is a  very grand  imposing person  i suppose  with his melancholy airs  and his  family  papa was worth a hundred of him  oh  past a quarter to ten  time  to go  and let him have his prayers to himself  augustina told me ten      she sprang up  and stiffly held out her hand      good night  mr  helbeck  i ought to go to augustina and settle her for  the night  to morrow i should like to tell you what the doctor said about  her  she is not strong at all  what time do you breakfast       half past eight  but  of course          oh  no  of course augustina won t come down  i will carry her up her  tray myself  good night      helbeck touched her hand  but as she turned away  he followed her a few  steps irresolutely  and then said   miss fountain    she looked round in  surprise    i should like you to understand that everything that can be  done in this poor house for my sister s comfort  and yours  i should wish  done  my resources are not great  but my will is good      he raised his eyelids  and she saw the eyes beneath  full  for the first  time   eyes grey like her own  but far darker and profounder  she felt a  momentary flutter  perhaps of compunction  then she thanked him and went  her way                                                 when she had made her stepmother comfortable for the night  laura  fountain went back to her room  shielding her candle with difficulty from  the gusts that seemed to tear along the dark passages of the old house   the march rawness made her shiver  and she looked shrinkingly into the  gloom before her  as she paused outside her own door  there  at the end  of the passage  lay the old tower  so mrs  denton had told her  the  thought of all the locked and empty rooms in it   dark  cold  spaces   haunted perhaps by strange sounds and presences of the past   seemed to let loose upon her all at once a little whirlwind of fear  she  hurried into her room  and was just setting down her candle before  turning to lock her door  when a sound from the distant hall caught her  ear     a deep monotonous sound  rising and falling at regular intervals  mr   helbeck reading prayers  with the two maids  who represented the only  service of the house     laura lingered with her hand on the door  in the silence of the ancient  house  there was something touching in the sound  a kind of appeal  but  it was an appeal which  in the girl s mind  passed instantly into  reaction  she locked the door  and turned away  breathing fast as though  under some excitement     the tears  long held down  were rising  and the room  where a large wood  fire was burning   wood was the only provision of which there was a  plenty at bannisdale   seemed to her suddenly stifling  she went to the  casement window and threw it open  a rush of mild wind came through  and  with it  the roar of the swollen river     the girl leant forward  bathing her hot face in the wild air  there was a  dark mist of trees below her  trees tossed by the wind  then  far down  a  ray of moonlight on water  beyond  a fell side  clear a moment beneath a  sky of sweeping cloud  and last of all  highest of all  amid the clouds   a dim radiance  intermittent and yet steady  like the radiance of moonlit  snow     a strange nobility and freedom breathed from the wide scene  from its  mere depth below her  from the spacious curve of the river  the mountains  half shown  half hidden  the great race of the clouds  the fresh beating  of the wind  the north spoke to her and the mountains  it was like the  rush of something passionate and straining through her girlish sense   intensifying all that was already there  what was this thirst  this  yearning  this physical anguish of pity that crept back upon her in all  the pauses of the day and night     it was nine months since she had lost her father  but all the scenes of  his last days were still so clear to her that it seemed to her often  sheer incredibility that the room  the bed  the helpless form  the noise  of the breathing  the clink of the medicine glasses  the tread of the  doctor  the gasping words of the patient  were all alike fragments and  phantoms of the past   that the house was empty  the bed sold  the  patient gone  oh  the clinging of the thin hand round her own  the  piteousness of suffering  of failure  poor  poor papa   he would not say   even to comfort her  that they would meet again  he had not believed it   and so she must not     no  and she would not  she raised her head fiercely and dried her tears   only  why was she here  in the house of a man who had never spoken to her  father  his brother in law  for thirteen years  who had made his sister  feel that her marriage had been a disgrace  who was all the time  no  doubt  cherishing such thoughts in that black  proud head of his  while  she  her father s daughter  was sitting opposite to him      how am i ever going to bear it  all these months   she asked herself           chapter ii    but the causes which had brought laura fountain to bannisdale were very  simple  it had all come about in the most natural inevitable way     when laura was eight years old  nearly thirteen years before this  date  her father  then a widower with one child  had fallen in with and  married alan helbeck s sister  at the time of their first meeting with  the little catholic spinster  stephen fountain and his child were  spending part of the cambridge vacation at a village on the cumberland  coast where a fine air could be combined with cheap lodgings  fountain  himself was from the north country  his grandfather had been a small  lancashire yeoman  and stephen fountain had an inbred liking for the  fells  the farmhouses  and even the rain of his native district  before  descending to the sea  he and his child had spent a couple of days with  his cousin by marriage  james mason  in the lonely stone house among the  hills  which had belonged to the family since the revolution  he left it  gladly  however  for the farm life seemed to him much harder and more  squalid than he had remembered it to be  and he disliked james mason s  wife  as he and laura walked down the long  rough track connecting the  farm with the main road on the day of their departure  stephen fountain  whistled so loud and merrily that the skipping child beside him looked at  him with astonishment     it was his way no doubt of thanking providence for the happy chance that  had sent his father to a small local government post at newcastle  and  himself to a grammar school with openings on the university  yet as a  rule he thought himself anything but a successful man  he held a  lectureship at cambridge in an obscure scientific subject  and was in his  way both learned and diligent  but he had few pupils  and had never cared  to have them  they interfered with his own research  and he had the  passionate scorn for popularity which grows up naturally in those who  have no power with the crowd  his religious opinions  or rather the  manner in which he chose to express them  divided him from many good men   he was poor  and he hated his poverty  a rather imprudent marriage had  turned out neither particularly well nor particularly ill  his wife had  some beauty  however  and there was hardly time for disillusion  she died  when laura was still a tottering baby  and stephen had missed her sorely  for a while  since her death he had grown to be a very lonely man   silently discontented with himself and sourly critical of his neighbours   yet all the same he thanked god that he was not his cousin james     potter s beach as a watering place was neither beautiful nor amusing   laura was happy there  but that said nothing  all her childhood through   she had the most surprising gift for happiness  from morning till night  she lived in a flutter of delicious nothings  unless he watched her  closely  stephen fountain could not tell for the life of him what she was  about all day  but he saw that she was endlessly about something  her  little hands and legs never rested  she dug  bathed  dabbled  raced   kissed  ate  slept  in one happy bustle  which never slackened except for  the hours when she lay rosy and still in her bed  and even then the  pretty mouth was still eagerly open  as though sleep had just breathed  upon its chatter for a few charmed moments  and  the joy within  was  already breaking from the spell     stephen fountain adored her  but his affections were never enough for  him  in spite of the child s spirits he himself found potter s beach a  desolation  all the more that he was cut off from his books for a time by  doctor s orders and his own common sense  suddenly  as he took his daily  walk over the sands with laura  he began to notice a thin lady in black   sitting alone under a bank of sea thistles  and generally struggling with  an umbrella which she had put up to shelter herself and her book from a  prevailing and boisterous wind  sometimes when he passed her in the  little street  he caught a glimpse of timid eyes  or he saw and pitied  the slight involuntary jerk of the head and shoulders  which seemed to  tell of nervous delicacy  presently they made friends  and he found her  lonely and discontented like himself  she was a catholic  he discovered   but her catholicism was not that of the convert  but of an old inherited  sort which sat easily enough on a light nature  then  to his  astonishment  it appeared that she lived with a brother at an old house  in north lancashire  a well known and even  in its degree  famous  house  which lay not seven miles distant from his grandfather s little  property  and had been quite familiar to him by repute  and even by sight  as a child  when he was a small lad staying at browhead farm  he had once  or twice found his way to the greet  and had strayed along its course  through bannisdale park  once even  when he was in the act of fishing a  particular pool where the trout were rising in a manner to tempt a very  archangel  he had been seized and his primitive rod broken over his  shoulder by an old man whom he believed to have been the owner  mr   helbeck himself   a magnificent white haired person  about whom tales ran  freely in the country side     so this little  shabby old maid was a helbeck of bannisdale  as he looked  at her  fountain could not help thinking with a hidden amusement of all  the awesome prestige the name had once carried with it for his boyish  ear  thirty years back  what a gulf had seemed to yawn between the  yeoman s grandson and the lofty owners of that stern and ancient house  upon the greet  and now  how glad was old helbeck s daughter to sit or  walk with him and his child   and how plain it grew  as the weeks passed  on  that if he  stephen fountain  willed it  she would make no difficulty  at all about a much longer companionship  fountain held himself to be the  most convinced of democrats  a man who had a reasoned right to his  radical opinions that commoner folk must do without  nevertheless  his  pride fed on this small turn of fortune  and when he carelessly addressed  his new friend  her name gave him pleasure     it seemed that she possessed but little else  poor lady  even in his  young days  fountain could remember that the helbecks were reported to be  straitened  to have already much difficulty in keeping up the house and  the estate  but clearly things had fallen by now to a much lower depth   miss helbeck s dress  talk  lodgings  all spoke of poverty  great  poverty  he himself had never known what it was to have a superfluous ten  pounds  but the feverish strain that belongs to such a situation as the  helbecks  awoke in him a new and sharp pity  he was very sorry for the  little  harassed creature  that physical privation should touch a woman  had always seemed to him a monstrosity     what was the brother about   a great strong fellow by all accounts   capable  surely  of doing something for the family fortunes   instinctively fountain held him responsible for the sister s fatigue and  delicacy  they had just lost their mother  and augustina had come to  potter s beach to recover from long months of nursing  and presently  fountain discovered that what stood between her and health was not so  much the past as the future      you don t like the idea of going home   he said to her once  abruptly   after they had grown intimate  she flushed  and hesitated  then her eyes  filled with tears     gradually he made her explain herself  the brother  it appeared  was  twelve years younger than herself  and had been brought up first at  stonyhurst  and afterwards at louvain  in constant separation from the  rest of the family  he had never had much in common with his home  since   at stonyhurst  he had come under the influence of a jesuit teacher  who   in the language of old helbeck  had turned him into  a fond sort of  fellow   swarming with notions that could only serve to carry the family  decadence a step further      we have been catholics for twenty generations   said augustina  in her  quavering voice   but our ways  father s ways  weren t good enough for  alan  we thought he was making up his mind to be a jesuit  and father was  mad about it  because of the old place  then father died  and alan came  home  he and my mother got on best  oh  he was very good to her  but he  and i weren t brought up in the same way  you d think he was already  under a rule  i don t  know  i suppose it s too high for me         she took up a handful of sand  and threw it  angrily  from her thin  fingers  hurrying on  however  as if the unburdenment  once begun  must  have its course      and it s hard to be always pulled up and set right by some one you ve  nursed in his cradle  oh  i don t mean he says anything  he and i never  had words in our lives  but it s the way he has of doing things  the  changes he makes  you feel how he disapproves of you  he doesn t like my  friends  our old friends  the house is like a desert since he came  and  the money he gives away  the priests just suck us dry  and he hasn t got  it to give  oh  i know it s all very wicked of me  but when i think of  going back to him  just us two  you know  in that old house  and all the  trouble about money         her voice failed her      well  don t go back   said fountain  laying his hand on her arm                                                 and twenty four hours later he was still pleased with himself and her  no  doubt she was stupid  poor augustina  and more ignorant than he had  supposed a human being could be  her only education seemed to have been  supplied by two years at the  couvent des dames anglaises  at st  omer   and all that she had retained from it was a small stock of french idioms   most of which she had forgotten how to use  though she did use them  frequently  with a certain timid pretension  of that habit fountain  the  fastidious  thought that he should break her  but for the rest  her  religion  her poverty   well  she had a hundred a year  so that he and  laura would be no worse off for taking her in  and the child s prospects   of course  should not suffer by a halfpenny  and as to the catholicism   fountain smiled to himself  no doubt there was some inherited feeling   but even if she did keep up her little mummeries  he could not see that  they would do him or laura any harm  and for the rest she suited him  she  somehow crept into his loneliness and fitted it  he was getting too old  to go farther  and he might well fare worse  in spite of her love of  talk  she was not a bad listener  and longer experience showed her to be  in truth the soft and gentle nature that she seemed  she had a curious  kind of vanity which showed itself in her feeling towards her brother   but fountain did not find it disagreeable  it even gave him pleasure to  flatter it  as one feeds or caresses some straying half starved creature   partly for pity  partly that the human will may feel its power      i wonder how much fuss that young man will make   fountain asked  himself  when at last it became necessary to write to bannisdale     augustina  however  was thirty five  in full possession of her little  moneys  and had no one to consult but herself  fountain enjoyed the  writing of the letter  which was brief  if not curt     alan helbeck appeared without an hour s delay at potter s beach  fountain  felt himself much inclined beforehand to treat the tall dark youth   sixteen years his junior  as a tutor treats an undergraduate  oddly  enough  however  when the two men stood face to face  fountain was once  more awkwardly conscious of that old sense of social distance which the  sister had never recalled to him  the sting of it made him rougher than  he had meant to be  otherwise the young man s very shabby coat  his  superb good looks  and courteous reserve of manner might almost have  disarmed the irritable scholar     as it was  helbeck soon discovered that fountain had no intention of  allowing augustina to apply for any dispensation for the marriage  that  he would make no promise of catholic bringing up  supposing there were  children  and that his idea was to be married at a registry office      i am one of those people who don t trouble themselves about the affairs  of another world   said fountain in a suave voice  as he stood in the  lodging house window  a bearded  broad shouldered person  his hands  thrust wilfully into the very baggy pockets of his ill fitting light  suit   i won t worry your sister  and i don t suppose there ll be any  children  but if there are  i really can t promise to make catholics of  them  and as for myself  i don t take things so easy as it s the fashion  to do now  i can t present myself in church  even for augustina      helbeck sat silent for a few minutes with his eyes on the ground  then he  rose      you ask what no catholic should grant   he said slowly   but that of  course you know  i can have nothing to do with such a marriage  and my  duty naturally will be to dissuade my sister from it as strongly as  possible      fountain bowed      she is expecting you   he said   i of course await her decision      his tone was hardly serious  nevertheless  during the time that helbeck  and augustina were pacing the sands together  fountain went through a  good deal of uneasiness  one never knew how or where this damned poison  in the blood might break out again  that young fanatic  a jesuit already  by the look of him  would of course try all their inherited mumbo jumbo  upon her  and what woman is at bottom anything more than the prey of the  last speaker     when  however  it was all over  and he was allowed to see his augustina  in the evening  he found her helpless with crying indeed  but as  obstinate as only the meek of the earth can be  she had broken wholly  with her brother and with bannisdale  and fountain gathered that  after  all helbeck s arguments and entreaties  there had flashed a moment of  storm between them  when the fierce  helbeck temper   traditional through  many generations  had broken down the self control of the ascetic  and  augustina must needs have trembled  however  there she was  frightened  and miserable  but still determined  and her terror was much more  concerned with the possibility of any return to live with alan and his  all exacting creed than anything else  fountain caught himself wondering  whether indeed she had imagination enough to lay much hold on those  spiritual terrors with which she had no doubt been threatened  in this   however  he misjudged her  as will be seen     meanwhile he sent for an elderly evangelical cousin of his wife s  who  was accustomed to take a friendly interest in his child and himself  she   in protestant jubilation over this brand snatched from the burning  came  in haste  very nearly departing  indeed  in similar haste as soon as the  unholy project of the secular marriage was mooted  however  under much  persuasion she remained  lamenting  augustina sent to bannisdale for her  few possessions  and the scanty ceremony was soon over     meanwhile laura had but found in the whole affair one more amusement and  excitement added to the many that  according to her  potter s beach  already possessed  the dancing elfish child  who had no memory of her own  mother  had begun by taking the little old maid under her patronising  wing  she graciously allowed augustina to make a lap for all the briny  treasures she might accumulate in the course of a breathless morning  she  rushed to give her first information whenever that encroaching monster  the sea broke down her castles  and as soon as it appeared that her papa  liked augustina  and had a use for her  laura at the age of eight  promptly accepted her as part of the family circle  without the smallest  touch of either sentiment or opposition  she walked gaily hand in hand  with her father to the registry office at st  bees  the jealously hidden   stormy little heart knew well enough that it had nothing to fear     then came many quiet years at cambridge  augustina spoke no more of her  brother  and apparently let her old creed slip  she conformed herself  wholly to her husband s ways   a little colourless thread on the stream  of academic life  slightly regarded  and generally silent out of doors   but at home a gentle  foolish  and often voluble person  very easily made  happy by some small kindness and a few creature comforts     laura meanwhile grew up  and no one exactly knew how  her education was a  thing of shreds and patches  managed by herself throughout  and  expressing her own strong will or caprice from the beginning  she put  herself to school  a day school only  and took herself away as soon as  she was tired of it  she threw herself madly into physical exercises like  dancing or skating  and excelled in most of them by virtue of a certain  wild grace  a tameless strength of spirits and will  and yet she grew up  small and pale  and it was not till she was about eighteen that she  suddenly blossomed into prettiness      carrotina  why  what s happened to you   said her father to her one day     she turned in astonishment from her task of putting some books tidy on  his study shelves  then she coloured half angrily      i must put my hair up some time  i suppose   she said resentfully  there  was something in the abruptness of her father s question  no less than in  the new closeness and sharpness of eye with which he was examining her   that annoyed her      well  you ve made a young lady of yourself  i dare say i mustn t call  you nicknames any more       i don t mind   she said indifferently  going on with her work  while he  looked at the golden red mass she had coiled round her little head  with  an odd half welcome sense of change  a sudden prescience of the future     then she turned again      if  if you make any absurd changes   she said  with a frown   i ll  i ll  cut it all off       you d better not  there d be ructions   he said laughing   it s not  yours till you re twenty one      and to himself he said   gracious  i didn t bargain for a pretty  daughter  what am i to do with her  augustina ll never get her married      and certainly during this early youth  laura showed no signs of getting  herself married  she did not apparently know when a young man was by  and  her bright vehement ways  her sharp turns of speech  went on just the  same  she neither quivered nor thrilled  and her chatter  when she did  chatter  spent itself almost with indifference on anyone who came near  her  she was generally gay  generally in spirits  and her girl companions  knew well that there was no one so reserved  and that the inmost self of  her  if such a thing existed  dwelt far away from any ken of theirs   every now and then she would have vehement angers and outbreaks which  contrasted with the nonchalance of her ordinary temper  but it was hard  to find the clue to them     altogether she passed for a clever girl  even in a university town  where  cleverness is weighed  but her education  except in two points  was  in  truth  of the slightest  any mechanical drudgery that her father could  set her  she did without a murmur  or  rather  she claimed it jealously   with a silent passion  but  with an obstinacy equally silent  she set  herself against the drudgery that would have made her his intellectual  companion     his rows of technical books  the scholarly and laborious details of his  work  filled her with an invincible repugnance  and he did not attempt to  persuade her  as to women and their claims  he was old fashioned and  contemptuous  he would have been much embarrassed by a learned daughter   that she should copy and tidy for him  that she should sit curled up for  hours with a book or a piece of work in a corner of his room  that she  should bring him his pipe  and break in upon his work at the right moment  with her peremptory  papa  come out    these things were delightful  nay   necessary to him  but he had no dreams beyond  and he never thought of  her  her education or her character  as a whole  it was not his way   besides  girls took their chance  with a boy  of course  one plans and  looks ahead  but laura would have     l   a year from her mother whatever  happened  and something more at his own death  why trouble oneself     no doubt indirectly he contributed very largely to her growing up  the  sight of his work and his methods  the occasional talks she overheard  between him and his scientific comrades  the tones of irony and denial in  the atmosphere about him  his antagonisms  his bitternesses  worked  strongly upon her still plastic nature  moreover she felt to her heart s  core that he was unsuccessful  there were appointments he should have  had  but had failed to get  and it was the religious party  the  clerical  crew  of convocation  that had stood in the way  from her childhood it  came natural to her to hate bigoted people who believed in ridiculous  things  it was they stood between her father and his deserts  there  loomed up  as it were  on her horizon  something dim and majestic  which  was called science  towards this her father pressed  she clinging to him   while all about them was a black and hindering crowd  through which they  clove their way  contemptuously     in one direction  indeed  fountain admitted her to his mind  like mill   he found the rest and balm of life in poetry  and here he took laura with  him  they read to each other  they spurred each other to learn by heart   he kept nothing from her  shelley was a passion of his own  it became  hers  she taught herself german  that she might read heine and goethe  with him  and one evening  when she was little more than sixteen  he  rushed her through the first part of  faust   so that she lay awake the  whole night afterwards in such a passion of emotion  that it seemed  for  the moment  to change her whole existence  sometimes it astonished him to  see what capacity she had  not only for the feeling  but for the sensuous  pleasure  of poetry  lines  sounds  haunted her for days  the beauty of  them would make her start and tremble     she did her best  however  to hide this side of her nature even from him   and it was not difficult  she remained childishly immature and backward  in many things  she was a personality  that was clear  one could hardly  say that she was or had a character  she was a bundle of loves and hates   a force  not an organism  and her father was often as much puzzled by her  as anyone else     music perhaps was the only study which ever conquered her indolence  here  it happened that a famous musician  who settled in cambridge for a time   came across her gift and took notice of it  and to please him she worked  with industry  even with doggedness  brahms  chopin  wagner  these great  romantics possessed her in music as shelley or rossetti did in poetry    you little demon  laura  how do you come to play like that   a girl  friend  her only intimate friend  said to her once in despair   it s the  expression  where do you get it  and i practise  and you don t  it s not  fair       expression   said laura  with annoyance   what does that matter  that s  the amateur all over  of course i play like that because i can t do it  any better  if i could  play the notes    she clenched her little hand   with a curious  almost a fierce energy   if i had any technique  or was  ever likely to have any  what should i want with expression  any cat can  give you expression  there was one under my window last night  you should  just have heard it      molly friedland  the girl friend  shrugged her shoulders  she was as  soft  as normal  as self controlled  as laura was wilful and irritable   but there was a very real affection between them     years passed  insensibly augustina s health began to fail  and with it  the new cheerfulness of her middle life  then fountain himself fell  suddenly and dangerously ill  all the peaceful habits and small pleasures  of their common existence broke down after a few days  as it were  into a  miserable confusion  augustina stood bewildered  then a convulsion of  soul she had expected as little as anyone else  swept upon her  a number  of obscure  inherited  half dead instincts revived  she lived in terror   she slept  weeping  and at the back of an old drawer she found a rosary  of her childhood to which her fingers clung night and day     meanwhile fountain resigned himself to death  during his last days his  dimmed senses did not perceive what was happening to his wife  but he  troubled himself about her a good deal      take care of her  laura   he said once   till she gets strong  look  after her   but you can t sacrifice your life   it may be christian   he  added  in a murmur   but it isn t sense      unconsciousness came on  augustina seemed to lose her wits  and at last  only laura  sitting pale and fierce beside her father  prevented her  stepmother from bringing a priest to his death bed   you would not   dare    said the girl  in her low  quivering voice  and augustina could  only wring her hands                                                 the day after her husband died mrs  fountain returned to her catholic  duties  when she came back from confession  she slipped as noiselessly as  she could into the darkened house  a door opened upstairs  and laura came  out of her father s room      you have done it   she said  as her stepmother  trembling with agitation  and weariness  came towards her   you have gone back to them       oh  laura  i had to follow the call  my conscience  laura  oh  your poor  father      and with a burst of weeping the widow held out her hands     laura did not move  and the hands dropped      my father wants nothing   she said     the indescribable pride and passion of her accent cowed augustina  and  she moved away  crying silently  the girl went back to the dead  and sat  beside him  in an anguish that had no more tears  till he was taken from  her     mr  helbeck wrote kindly to his sister in reply to a letter from her  informing him of her husband s death  and of her own reconciliation with  the church  he asked whether he should come at once to help them through  the business of the funeral  and the winding up of their cambridge life    beg him  please  to stay away   said laura  when the letter was shown  her   there are plenty of people here      and indeed cambridge  which had taken little notice of the fountains  during stephen s lifetime  was even fussily kind after his death to his  widow and child  it was at all times difficult to be kind to laura in  distress  but there was much true pity felt for her  and a good deal of  curiosity as to her relations with her catholic stepmother  only from the  friedlands  however  would she accept  or allow her stepmother to accept   any real help  dr  friedland was a man of middle age  who had retired on  moderate wealth to devote himself to historical work by the help of the  cambridge libraries  he had been much drawn to stephen fountain  and  fountain to him  it was a recent and a brief friendship  but there had  been something in it on dr  friedland s side  something respectful and  cordial  something generous and understanding  for which laura loved the  infirm and grey haired scholar  and would always love him  she shed some  stormy tears after parting with the friedlands  otherwise she left  cambridge with joy     on the day before they left cambridge augustina received a parcel of  books from her brother  for the most part they were kept hidden from  laura  but in the evening  when the girl was doing some packing in her  stepmother s room  she came across a little volume lying open on its  face  she lifted it  saw that it was called  outlines of catholic  belief   and that one page was still wet with tears  an angry curiosity  made her look at what stood there   a believer in one god who  without  wilful fault on his part  knows nothing of the divine mystery of the  trinity  is held capable of salvation by many catholic theologians  and  there is the  invincible ignorance  of the heathen  what else is possible  to the divine mercy let none of us presume to know  our part in these  matters is obedience  not speculation      in faint pencil on the margin was written   my stephen  could  not  believe  mary  pray         the book contained the bannisdale book plate  and the name  alan  helbeck   laura threw it down  but her face trembled through its scorn   and she finished what she was doing in a kind of blind passion  it was as  though she held her father s dying form in her arms  protecting him  against the same meddling and tyrannical force that had injured him while  he lived  and was still making mouths at him now that he was dead     she and augustina went to the sea  to folkestone  for augustina s health   here mrs  fountain began to correspond regularly with her brother  and it  was soon clear that her heart was hungering for him  and for her old home  at bannisdale  but she was still painfully dependent on laura  laura was  her maid and nurse  laura managed all her business  at last one day she  made her prayer  would laura go with her  for a little while  to  bannisdale  alan wished it  alan had invited them both   he would be so  good to you  laura  and i m sure it would set me up      laura gave a gulp  she dropped her little chin on her hands and thought   well  why not  it would be all hateful to her  mr  helbeck and his house  together  she knew very well  or guessed what his relation to her father  had been  but what if it made augustina strong  if in time she could be  left with her brother altogether  to live with him   in one or two of his  letters he had proposed as much  why  that would bring laura s  responsibility  her sole responsibility  at any rate  to an end     she thought of molly friedland  of their girlish plans  of travel  of  music      all right   she said  springing up   we will go  augustina  i suppose   for a little while  mr  helbeck and i can keep the peace  you must tell  him to let me alone      she paused  then said with sudden vehemence  like one who takes her  stand   and tell him  please  augustina  make it very plain  that i shall  never come in to prayers            chapter iii    the sun was shining into laura s room when she awoke  she lay still for a  little while  looking about her     her room  which formed part of an eighteenth century addition to the  tudor house  was rudely panelled with stained deal  save on the fireplace  wall  where  on either side of the hearth  the plaster had been covered  with tapestry  the subject of the tapestry was diana hunting  diana   white and tall  with her bow and quiver  came  queenly  through a green  forest  two greyhounds ranged beside her  and in the dim distance of the  wood her maidens followed  on the right an old castle  with pillars like  a greek temple  rose stately but a little crooked on the edge of a blue  sea  the sea much faded  with the wooden handle of a cupboard thrust  rudely through it  two long limbed ladies  with pulled patched faces   stood on the castle steps  in front was a ship  with a waiting warrior  and a swelling sail  and under him  a blue wave worn very threadbare   shamed indeed by that intruding handle  but still blue enough  still  windy enough for thoughts of love and flight     laura  half asleep still  with her hands under her cheek  lay staring in  a vague pleasure at the castle and the forest   enchanted  casements    perilous seas    in fairy lands forlorn   the lines ran  sleepily  a little jumbled  in her memory     but gradually the morning and the freshness worked  and her spirits   emerging from their half dream  began to dance within her  when she  sprang up to throw the window wide  there below her was the sparkling  river  the daffodils waving their pale heads in the delicate westmoreland  grass  the high white clouds still racing before the wind  how heavenly  to find oneself in this wild clean country   after all the ugly squalors  of parade and lodging house  after the dingy bow windowed streets with  the march dust whirling through them     she leant across the broad window sill  her chin on her hands  absorbed   drinking it in  the eastern sun  coming slanting ways  bathed her tumbled  masses of fair hair  her little white form  her bare feet raised tiptoe     suddenly she drew back  she had seen the figure of a man crossing the  park on the further side of the river  and the maidenly instinct drove  her from the window  though the man in question was perhaps a quarter of  a mile away  and had he been looking for her  could not possibly have  made out more than a pale speck on the old wall      mr  helbeck    she thought   by the height of him  where is he off to  before seven o clock in the morning  i hate a man that can t keep  rational hours like other people  fricka  come here      for her little dog  who had sprung from the bed after its mistress  was  now stretching and blinking behind her  at laura s voice it jumped up and  tried to lick her face  laura caught it in her arms and sat down on the  bed  still hugging it      no  fricka  i don t like him  i don t  i don t  i  don t   but you and i  have just got to behave  if you annoy that big dog downstairs  he ll  break your neck   he will  fricka  as for me    she shrugged her small  shoulders    well  mr  helbeck can t break  my  neck  so i m dreadfully  afraid i shall annoy him  dreadfully  dreadfully afraid  but i ll try  not  you see  what we ve got to do  is just to get augustina well  stand  over her with a broomstick and pour the tonics down her throat  then   fricka  we ll go our way and have some fun  now look at us          she moved a little  so that the cracked glass on the dressing table  reflected her head and shoulders  with the dog against her neck      you know we re not at all bad looking  fricka  neither of us  i ve seen  much worse   oh  fricka  i ve told you scores of times i can wash my  face  without you  thank you   there s all sorts of nice things that  might happen if we just put ourselves in the way of them  oh  i do want  some fun  i do   at least sometimes      but again the voice dropped suddenly  the big greenish eyes filled in a  moment with inconsistent tears  and laura sat staring at the sunshine   while the drops fell on her white nightgown     meanwhile fricka  being half throttled  made a violent effort and  escaped  laura too sprang up  wiped away her tears as though she were  furious with them  and began to look about her for the means of dressing   everything in the room was of the poorest and scantiest  the cottage  washstand with its crockery  the bare dressing table and dilapidated  glass      a bath   my kingdom for a bath  i don t mind starving  but one must  wash  let s ring for that rough haired girl  fricka  and try and get  round her  goodness   no bells      after long search  however  she discovered a tattered shred of tapestry  hanging in a corner  and pulled it vigorously  many efforts  however   were needed before there was a sound of feet in the passage outside   laura hastily donned a blue dressing gown  and stood expectant     the door was opened unceremoniously and a girl thrust in her head  laura  had made acquaintance with her the night before  she was the  housekeeper s underling and niece      mrs  denton says i m not to stop  she s noa time for answerin bells  and  you ll have some hot water when t  kettle boils      the door was just shutting again when laura sprang at the speaker and  caught her by the arm      my dear   she said  dragging the girl in   that won t do at all  now  look here   she held up her little white hand  shaking the forefinger  with energy   i don t  want  to give  any trouble  and mrs  denton may  keep her hot water  but i must have a bath  and a big can  and somebody  must show me where to go for water  and then   then   my dear  if you  make yourself agreeable  i ll  well  i ll teach you how to do your hair  on sundays  in a way that will surprise you      the girl stared at her in sudden astonishment  her dark stupid eyes  wavering  she had a round  peasant face  not without comeliness  and a  lustreless shock of black hair  laura laughed      i will   she said  nodding   you ll see  and i ll give you notions for  your best frock  i ll be a regular elder sister to you  if you ll just do  a few things for me  and mrs  fountain  what s your name  ellen   that s  all right  now  is there a bath in the house      the girl unwillingly replied that there was one in the big room at the  end of the passage      show it me   said laura  and marched her off there  the rough headed one  led the way along the panelled passage and opened a door     then it was laura s turn to stare     inside she saw a vast room with finely panelled walls and a decorated  ceiling  the sunlight poured in through an uncurtained window upon the  only two objects in the room   a magnificent bed  carved and gilt  with  hangings of tarnished brocade   and a round tin bath of a common   old fashioned make  propped up against the wall  the oak boards were  absolutely bare  the bed and the bath looked at each other      what s become of all the furniture   said laura  gazing round her in  astonishment      the gentleman from edinburgh had it all  lasst month   said the girl   still sullenly   he s affther the bed now       oh   does he often come here      the girl hesitated      well  he s had a lot o  things oot o  t  house  sen i came       has he   said laura   now  then  lend a hand      between them they carried off the bath  and then laura informed herself  where water was to be had  and when breakfast would be ready      t  squire s gone oot   said ellen  still watching the newcomer from  under a pair of very black and beetling brows   and mrs  denton said she  supposed yo d be wantin a tray for mrs  fountain       does the squire take no breakfast       noa  he s away to mass  ivery mornin  an  he gets his breakfast wi   father bowles      the girl s look grew more hostile      oh  does he   said laura in a tone of meditation   well  then  look  here  put another cup and another plate on mrs  fountain s tray  and i ll  have mine with her  shall i come down to the kitchen for it       noa   said the girl hastily   mrs  denton doan t like foak i  t   kitchen      at that moment a call in mrs  denton s angriest tones came pealing along  the passage outside  laura laughed and pushed the girl out of the room                                                 an hour later miss fountain was ministering to her stepmother in the most  comfortable bedroom that the house afforded  the furniture  indeed  was a  medley  it seemed to have been gathered out of many other rooms  but at  any rate there was abundance of it  a carpet much worn  but still useful   covered the floor  and ellen had lit the fire without being summoned to  do it  laura recognised that mr  helbeck must have given a certain number  of precise orders on the subject of his sister     poor mrs  fountain  however  was not happy  she was sitting up in bed   wrapped in an unbecoming flannel jacket  augustina had no taste in  clothes  and looking with an odd repugnance at the very passable  breakfast that laura placed before her  laura did not quite know what to  make of her  in old days she had always regarded her stepmother as an  easy going  rather self indulgent creature  who liked pleasant food and  stuffed chairs  and could be best managed or propitiated through some  attention to her taste in sofa cushions or in tea cakes     no doubt  since mrs  fountain s reconciliation with the church of her  fathers  she had shown sometimes an anxious disposition to practise the  usual austerities of good catholics  but neither doctor nor director had  been able to indulge her in this respect  owing to the feebleness of her  health  and on the whole she had acquiesced readily enough     but laura found her now changed and restless      oh  laura  i can t eat all that       you must   said laura firmly   really  augustina  you  must        alan s gone out   said augustina  with a wistful inconsequence   straining her eyes as though to look through the diamond panes of the  window opposite  at the park and the persons walking in it      yes  he seems to go to whinthorpe every morning for mass  ellen says he  breakfasts with the priest      augustina sighed and fidgeted  but when she was half way through her  meal  laura standing over her  she suddenly laid a shaking hand on  laura s arm      laura   alan s a saint   he always was  long ago  when i was so blind  and wicked  but now  oh  the things mrs  denton s been telling me       has she   said laura coolly   well  make up your mind  augustina   she  shook her bright head   that you can t be the same kind of saint that he  is  anyway      mrs  fountain withdrew her hand in quick offence      i should be glad if you could talk of these things without flippancy   laura  when i think how incapable i have been all these years  of  understanding my dear brother          no  you see you were living with papa   said laura slowly     she had left her stepmother s side  and was standing with her back to an  old cabinet  resting her elbows upon it  her brows were drawn together   and poor mrs  fountain  after a glance at her  looked still more  miserable      your poor papa   she murmured with a gulp  and then  as though to  propitiate laura  she drew her breakfast back to her  and again tried to  eat it  small and slight as they both were  there was a very sharp  contrast between her and her stepdaughter  laura s features were all  delicately clear  and nothing could have been more definite  more  brilliant than the colour of the eyes and hair  or the whiteness  which  was a beautiful and healthy whiteness  of her skin  whereas everything  about mrs  fountain was indeterminate  the features with their slight  twist to the left  the complexion  once fair  and now reddened by years  and ill health  the hair  of a yellowish grey  the head and shoulders  with their nervous infirmity  only the eyes still possessed some purity  of colour  through all their timidity or wavering  they were still blue  and sweet  perhaps they alone explained why a good many  persons  including her stepdaughter  were fond of augustina      what has mrs  denton been telling you about mr  helbeck   laura  inquired  speaking with some abruptness  after a pause      you wouldn t have any sympathy  laura   said mrs  fountain  in some  agitation   you see  you don t understand our catholic principles  i wish  you did   oh  i wish you did  but you don t  and so perhaps i d better  not talk about it       it might interest me to know the facts   said laura  in a little hard  voice   it seems to me that i m likely to be mr  helbeck s guest for a  good while       but you won t like it  laura   cried mrs  fountain   and you ll  misunderstand alan  your poor dear father always misunderstood him     laura made a restless movement    it is not because we think we can save  our souls by such things  of course not   that s the way you protestants  put it          i m not a protestant   said laura hotly  mrs  fountain took no notice      but it s what the church calls  mortification    she said  hurrying on    it s keeping the body under  as st  paul did  that s what makes  saints  and it does make saints  whatever people say  your poor father  didn t agree  of course  but he didn t know   oh  dear  dear stephen   he  didn t know  and alan isn t cross  and it doesn t spoil his health  it  doesn t  really       what does he do   asked laura  trying for the point     but poor augustina  in her mixed flurry of feeling  could hardly explain      you see  laura  there s a strict way of keeping lent  and  well  just  the common way  doing as little as you can  it used to be all much  stricter  of course       in the dark ages   suggested laura  augustina took no notice      and what the books tell you now  is much stricter than what anybody  does   i m sure i don t know why  but alan takes it strictly  he wants to  go back to quite the old ways  oh  i wish i could explain it         mrs  fountain stopped bewildered  she was sure she had heard once that in  the early church people took no food at all till the evening  not even a  drink  but alan was not going to do that     laura had taken fricka on her knee  and was straightening the ribbon  round the dog s neck      does he eat  anything    she asked carelessly  looking up   if it s   nothing   that would be interesting       laura  if you only would try and understand   of course alan doesn t  settle such a thing for himself  nobody does with us  that s only in the  english church      augustina straightened herself  with an unconscious arrogance  laura  looked at her  smiling      who settles it  then       why  his director  of course  he must have leave  but they have given  him leave  he has chosen a rule for himself   augustina gave a visible  gulp   and he called mrs  denton to him before lent  and told her about  it  of course he ll hide it as much as he can  catholics must never be  singular  never  but if we live in the house with him he can t hide it   and all lent  he only eats meat on sundays  and other days  he wrote down  a list     well  it s like the saints  that s all   i just cried over  it      mrs  fountain shook with the emotion of saying such things to laura  but  her blue eyes flamed      what  fish and eggs   that kind of thing   said laura   as if there was  any hardship in that       laura  how can you be so unkind   i must just keep it all to myself   i  won t tell you anything   cried augustina in exasperation     laura walked away to the window  and stood looking out at the march buds  on the sycamores shining above the river      does he make the servants fast too   she asked presently  turning her  head over her shoulder      no  no   said her stepmother eagerly   he s never hard on them  only to  himself  the church doesn t expect anything more than  abstinence   you  understand  not real fasting  from people like them  people who work hard  with their hands  but  i really believe  they do very much as he does   mrs  denton seems to keep the house on nothing  oh  and  laura  i really  can t be always having extra things      mrs  fountain pushed her breakfast away from her      please remember  nobody settles anything for themselves  in your  church   said laura   you know what that doctor  that catholic  doctor  said to you at folkestone      mrs  fountain sighed      and as to mrs  denton  i see  that explains the manners  no  improvement  till lent s over       laura      but her stepdaughter  who was at the window again looking out  paid no  heed  and presently augustina said with timid softness      won t you have your breakfast  laura  you know it s here  on my tray      laura turned  and augustina to her infinite relief saw not frowns  but a  face all radiance      i ve been watching the lambs in the field across the river  such  ridiculous enchanting things   such jumps  and affectations  and the  river s heavenly  and all the general  feel  of it  i really don t know   augustina  how you ever came to leave this country when you d once been  born in it      mrs  fountain pushed away her tray  shook her head sadly  and said  nothing      what is it   and who is it   cried laura  standing amazed before a  picture in the drawing room at bannisdale     in front of her  on the panelled wall  hung a dazzling portrait of a girl  in white  a creature light as a flower under wind  eyes upraised and  eager  as though to welcome a lover  fair hair bound turban like with a  white veil  the pretty hands playing with a book  it shone from the brown  wall with a kind of natural sovereignty over all below it and around it   so brilliant was the picture  so beautiful the woman     augustina looked up drearily  she was sitting shrunk together in a large  chair  deep in some thoughts of her own      that s our picture  the famous picture   she explained slowly      your romney   said laura  vaguely recalling some earlier talk of her  stepmother s     augustina nodded  she stared at the picture with a curious agitation  as  though she were seeing its long familiar glories for the first time   laura was much puzzled by her      well  but it s magnificent   cried the girl   one needn t know much to  know that  how can mr  helbeck call himself poor while he possesses such  a thing      augustina started      it s worth thousands   she said hastily   we know that  there was a man  from london came once  years ago  but papa turned him out  he would never  sell his things  and she was our great grandmother      an idea flashed through laura s mind      you don t mean to say that mr  helbeck is going to sell her   said laura  impetuously   it would be a shame       alan can do what he likes with anything   said augustina in a quick  resentment   and he wants money badly for one of his orphanages  some of  it has to be rebuilt  oh  those orphanages  how they must have weighed on  him  poor alan   poor dear alan   all these years      mrs  fountain clasped her thin hands together  with a sigh      is it they that have eaten up the house bit by bit   poor house   poor  dear house   repeated laura     she was staring with an angry championship at the picture  its sweet  confiding air  as of one cradled in love  happy for generations in the  homage of her kindred and the shelter of the old house  stood for all the  natural human things that creeds and bigots were always trampling under  foot     mrs  fountain  however  only shook her head      i don t think alan s settled anything yet  only mrs  denton s  afraid   there was somebody came to see it a few days ago          he certainly ought not to sell it   repeated laura with emphasis   he  has to think of the people that come after  what will they care for  orphanages  he only holds the picture in trust       there will be no one to come after   said augustina slowly   for of  course he will never marry       is he too great a saint for that too   cried laura   then all i can say   augustina  is that  it  would  do him a great deal of good      she beat her little foot on the ground impatiently  pointing the words      you don t know anything about him  laura   said mrs  fountain  with an  attempt at spirit  then she added reproachfully   and i m sure he wants  to be kind to you       he thinks me a little heretical toad  thank you   said laura  spinning  round on the bare boards  and dropping a curtsey to the romney   but  never mind  augustina  we shall get on quite properly  now  aren t there  a great many more rooms to see      augustina rose uncertainly   there is the chapel  of course   she said    and alan s study          oh  we needn t go there   said laura hastily   but show me the chapel      mr  helbeck was still absent  and they had been exploring bannisdale  it  was a melancholy progress they had been making through a house that had  once  when augustina left it  stood full of the hoardings and the  treasures of generations  and was now empty and despoiled     it was evident that  for his sister s welcome  mr  helbeck had gathered  into the drawing room  as into her bedroom upstairs  the best of what  still remained to him  chairs and tables  and straight lined sofas  some  of one date  some of another  collected from the garrets and remote  corners of the old house  and covered with the oddest variety of faded  stuffs  had been stiffly set out by mrs  denton upon an old turkey  carpet  whereof the rents and patches had been concealed as much as  possible  here at least was something of a cosmos  something of order and  of comfort     the hall too  and the dining room  in spite of their poor new  furnishings  were still human and habitable  but most of the rooms on  which laura and mrs  fountain had been making raid were like that first  one laura had visited  mere homes of lumber and desolation  blinds drawn   dust motes dancing in the stray shafts of light that struck across the  gloom of the old walls and floors  here and there some lingering fragment  of fine furniture  but as a rule bareness  poverty  and void  nothing  could be more piteous  or  to mrs  fountain s memory  more surprising   for some years before she left bannisdale  her father had not known where  to turn for a pound of ready money  yet when she fled from it  the house  and its treasures were still intact     the explanation of course was very simple  alan helbeck had been living  upon his house  as upon any other capital  or rather he had been making  alms of it  the house stood gashed and bare that catholic orphans might  be put to school  was that it  laura hardly listened to augustina s  plaintive babble as they crossed the hall  it was all about alan  of  course  alan s virtues  alan s charities  as for the orphans  the girl  hated the thought of them  grasping little wretches  she could see them  all in a sanctimonious row  their eyes cast up  and rosaries  like the  one augustina was always trying to hide from her  in their ugly little  hands     they turned down a long stone passage leading to the chapel  as they  neared the chapel door there was a sound of voices from the hall at their  back      it s alan   said augustina peering   and father bowles      she hurried back to meet them  skirts and cap strings flying  laura stood  still     but after a few words with his sister  helbeck came up to his guest with  outstretched hand      i hope we have not kept you waiting for dinner  may i introduce father  bowles to you      laura bowed with all the stiffness of which a young back is capable  she  saw an old grey haired priest  with a round face and a pair of chubby  hands  which he constantly held crossed or clasped upon his breast  his  long irregular mouth seemed to fold over at the corners above his very  small and childish chin  the mouth and the light blue eyes wore an  expression of rather mincing gentleness  his short figure  though bent a  little with years  was still vigorous  and his gait quick and bustling     he addressed miss fountain with a lisping and rather obsequious  politeness  asking a great many unnecessary questions about her journey  and her arrival     laura answered coldly  but when he passed to mrs  fountain  augustina was  all effusion      when i think what has been granted to us since i was here last   she  said to the priest as they moved on   clasping her hands  and flushing      the dear bishop took such trouble about it   he said in a little  murmuring voice   it was not easy  but the church loves to content her  children      involuntarily laura glanced at helbeck      my sister refers to the permission which has been granted to us to  reserve the blessed sacrament in the chapel   he said gravely   it is a  privilege we never enjoyed till last year      laura made no reply      shall i slip away   she thought  looking round her     but at that moment mr  helbeck lifted the heavy latch of the chapel door   and her young curiosity was too strong for her  she followed the others     mr  helbeck held the door open for her      you will perhaps care to look at the frescoes   he said to her as she  hurried past him  she nodded  and walked quickly away to the left  by  herself  then she turned and looked about her     it was the first time that she had entered a catholic church  and every  detail was new to her  she watched the other three sign themselves with  holy water and drop low on one knee before the altar  so that was the  altar  she stared at it with a scornful repugnance  yet her pulse  quickened as though what she saw excited her  what was that erection  above it  with a veil of red silk drawn round it  and why was that lamp  burning in front of it     she recalled mr  helbeck s words   permission to reserve the blessed  sacrament   then  in a flash  a hundred vague memories  the deposit of a  hearsay knowledge  enlightened her  she knew and remembered much less  than any ordinary girl would have done  but still  in the main  she  guessed at what was passing  that of course was the sacrament  before  which mr  helbeck and the others were kneeling   for instinctively she  felt that it was to no empty shrine the adoration of those silent figures  was being offered     fragments from augustina s talk at folkestone came back to her  once she  had overheard some half whispered conversation between her stepmother and  a catholic friend  from which she had vaguely understood that the   blessed sacrament  was kept in the catholic churches  was always there   and that the faithful  visited  it  that these  visits  were indeed  specially recommended as a means to holiness  and she recalled how  as  they came home from their daily walk to the beach  mrs  fountain would  disappear from her  through the shadowy door of a catholic church that  stood in the same street as their lodgings  how she would come home half  an hour afterwards  shaken with fresh ardours  fresh remorse     but how could such a thing be allowed  be possible  in a private  chapel  in a room that was really part of a private house  god  the  christ of calvary  in that gilt box  upon that altar     the young girl s arms fell by her side in a sudden rigidity  a wave of  the most passionate repulsion swept through her  what a gross  what an  intolerable superstition   how was she to live with it  beside it  the  next instant it was as though her hand clasped her father s  clinging to  him proudly  against this alien world  why should she feel lonely   the  little heretic  left standing there alone in her distant corner  let her  rather rejoice that she was her father s daughter     she drew herself up  and coolly looked about her  the worshippers had  risen  long as the time had seemed to laura  they had only been two or  three minutes on their knees  and she could see that augustina was  talking eagerly to her brother  pointing now to the walls  now to the  altar     it seemed as though augustina were no less astonished than her  stepdaughter by the magnificence of the chapel  was it all new   the  frescoes  the altar with its marble and its gold  the white figure of the  virgin  which gleamed above the small side altar to the left  it had the  air of newness and of costliness  an air which struck the eye all the  more sharply because of the contrast between it and the penury  the  starvation  of the great house that held the chapel in its breast     but while laura was still wondering at the general impression of rich  beauty  at the lenten purple of the altar  at the candelabra  and the  perfume  certain figures and colours on the wall close to her seized her   thrusting the rest aside  on either side of the altar  the walls to right  and left  from the entrance up to the sanctuary  were covered with what  appeared to be recent painting  painting  indeed  that was still in the  act  on either hand  long rows of life sized saints  men and women   turned their adoring faces towards the christ looking down upon them from  a crucifix above the tabernacle  on the north wall  about half the row  was unfinished  faces  haloes  drapery  strongly outlined in red  still  waited for the completing hand of the artist  the rest glowed and burned  with colour  colour the most singular  the most daring  the carnations  and rose colours  the golds and purples  the blues and lilacs and  greens  in the whole concert of tone  in spite of its general simplicity  of surface  there was something at once ravishing and troubling   something that spoke as it were from passion to passion     laura s nature felt the thrill of it at once  just as she had felt the  thrill of the sunshine lighting up the tapestry of her room      why isn t it crude and hideous   she asked herself  in a marvel   but it  isn t  one never saw such blues  except in the sea  or such greens  and  rose  and the angels between   and the flowers under their  feet   heavens  how lovely  who did it       do you admire the frescoes   said a little voice behind her     she turned hastily  and saw father bowles smiling upon her  his plump  white hands clasped in front of him  as usual  it was an attitude which  seemed to make the simplest words sound intimate and possessive  laura  shrank from  it in quick annoyance      they are very strange  and  and startling   she said stiffly  moving as  far away from the grey haired priest as possible   who painted them       mr  helbeck first designed them  but they were carried out for a time by  a youth of great genius   father bowles dwelt softly upon the word    ge  nius   as though he loved it   he was once a lad from these parts   but has now become a jesuit  so the work was stopped       what a pity   said laura impetuously   he ought to have been a painter      the priest smiled  and made her an odd little bow  then  without saying  anything more about the artist  he chattered on about the frescoes and  the chapel  as though he had beside him the most sympathetic of  listeners  nothing that he said was the least interesting or striking   and laura  in a passion of silent dislike  kept up a steady movement  towards the door all the time     in the passage outside mrs  fountain was lingering alone  and when laura  appeared she caught hold of her stepdaughter and detained her while the  priest passed on  laura looked at her in surprise  and mrs  fountain  in  much agitation  whispered in the girl s ear      oh  laura  do remember  dear   don t ask alan about those  pictures  those frescoes  by young williams  i can tell you some  time  and you might say something to hurt him  poor alan      laura drew herself away      why should i say anything to hurt him  what s the mystery       i can t tell you now   mrs  fountain looked anxiously towards the hall    people have been so hard on alan   so  unkind about it  it s been a  regular persecution  and you wouldn t understand  wouldn t  sympathise          i really don t care to know about it  augustina  and i m so  hungry  famished  look  there s mr  helbeck signing to us  joy   that s  dinner                                                  laura expected the midday meal with some curiosity  but she saw no signs  of austerity  mr  helbeck pressed the roast chicken on father bowles   took pains that he should enjoy a better bottle of wine than usual  and  as to himself ate and drank very moderately indeed  but like anybody  else  laura could only imagine that it was not seemly to outdo your  priest     the meal of course was served in the simplest way  and all the waiting  was done by mr  helbeck  who would allow nobody to help him in the task     the conversation dragged  laura and her host talked a little about the  country and the weather  father bowles and augustina tried to pick up the  dropped threads of thirteen years  and mrs  fountain was alternately  eager for whinthorpe gossip  or reduced to an abrupt unhappy silence by  some memory of the past     suddenly father bowles got up from his chair  ran across the room to the  window with his napkin in his hand  and pounced eagerly upon a fly that  was buzzing on the pane  then he carefully opened the window  and flicked  the dead thing off the sill      i beg your pardon   he said humbly to mrs  fountain as he returned to  his seat   it was a nasty fly  i can t abide  em  i always think of  beelzebub  who was the prince of the flies      laura s mouth twitched with laughter  she promised herself to make a  study of father bowles     and  indeed  he was a character in his own small way  he was a priest of  an old fashioned type  with no pretensions to knowledge or to manners   wherever he went he was a meek and accommodating guest  for his  recollection went back to days when a priest coming to a private house to  say mass would as likely as not have his meals in the pantry  and he was  naturally of a gentle and yielding temper  though rather sly     but he had several tricks as curious as they were persistent  not even  the presence of his bishop could make him spare a bluebottle  and he had   on the other hand  a peculiar passion for the smell of wax  he would blow  out a candle on the altar before the end of mass that he might enjoy the  smell of it  he disliked jesuits  and religious generally  if the truth  were known  excepting only the orphanage nuns  who knew his weaknesses  and were kind to them  he had no love for modern innovations  or modern  devotions  there was a hidden gallican strain in him  and he firmly  believed that in the old days before catholic emancipation  and before  the oxford movement  the church made more converts than she did now                                                 towards the end of the lunch laura inquired of mr  helbeck whether any  conveyance was to be got in the village      i wish to go to browhead farm this afternoon   she said rather shortly      certainly   said helbeck   certainly  i will see that something is found  for you      but his voice had no cordiality  and laura at once thought him  ungracious      oh  pray don t give yourself any trouble   she said  flushing   i can  walk to the village      helbeck paused      if you could wait till to morrow   he said after a moment   i could  promise you the pony  unfortunately he is busy this afternoon       oh  do wait  laura   cried augustina   there is so much unpacking to  do       very well   said the girl unwillingly     as she turned away from him helbeck s look followed her  she was in a  dress of black serge  which followed the delicate girlish frame with  perfect simplicity  and was relieved at the neck and wrists with the  plainest of white collars and cuffs  but there was something so brilliant  in the hair  so fawnlike in the carriage of the head  that she seemed to  helbeck to be all elegance  had he been asked to describe her  he would  have said she was in  grande toilette   little as he spoke to her  he  found himself perpetually conscious of her  her evident  childishly  evident  dislike of her new surroundings half amused  half embarrassed  him  he did not know what topic to start with her  soon  perhaps  he  might have a difficulty in keeping the peace  it was all very absurd     after luncheon they gathered in the hall for a while  father bowles  talking eagerly with helbeck and augustina about  orphans  and  new  buildings   laura stood apart awhile  then went for her hat     when she reappeared  in walking dress  with fricka at her heels  helbeck  opened the heavy outer door for her      may i have bruno   she said     helbeck turned and whistled      you are not afraid   he said  smiling  and looking at fricka      oh  dear no  i spent an hour this morning introducing them      at that moment bruno came bounding up  he looked from his master to laura  in her hat  and seemed to hesitate  then  as she descended the steps  he  sprang after her  laura began to run  the two dogs leapt about her  her  light voice  checking or caressing  came back to helbeck on the spring  wind  he watched her and her companions so long as they were in  sight  the golden hair among the trees  the dancing steps of the girl   the answering frolic of the dogs     then he turned back to his sister  his grave mouth twitching      how thankful she is to get rid of us      he laughed out  the priest laughed  too  more softly      it was the first time  i presume  that miss fountain had ever been  within a catholic church   he said to augustina     augustina flushed      of course it is the first time  oh  alan  you can t think how strange it  is to her      she looked rather piteously at her brother      so i perceive   he said   you told me something  but i had not  realised          you see  alan    cried augustina  watching her brother s face    it was  with the greatest difficulty that her mother got stephen to consent even  to her being baptized  he opposed it for a long time      father bowles murmured something under his breath     helbeck paused for a moment  then said      what was her mother like       everyone at cambridge used to say she was  a sweet woman   but  but  stephen   well  you know  alan  stephen always had his way  i always  wonder she managed to persuade him about the baptism      she coloured still more deeply as she spoke  and her nervous infirmity  became more pronounced  alas  it was not only with the first wife that  stephen had had his way  her own marriage had begun to seem to her a mere  sinful connection  poor soul  poor augustina     her brother must have divined something of what was passing in her mind   for he looked down upon her with a peculiar gentleness      people are perhaps more ready to talk of that responsibility than to  take it   he said kindly   but  augustina     his voice changed    how  pretty she is   you hardly prepared me         father bowles modestly cast down his eyes  these were not questions that  concerned him  but helbeck went on  speaking with decision  and looking  at his sister      i confess  her great attractiveness makes me a little anxious  about the  connection with the masons  have you ever seen any of them  augustina      no  augustina had seen none of them  she believed stephen had  particularly disliked the mother  the widow of his cousin  who now owned  the farm jointly with her son      well  no   said helbeck dryly   i don t suppose he and she would have  had much in common       isn t she a dreadful protestant  alan       oh  she s just a specimen of the ordinary english bible worship run  mad   he said  carelessly   she is a strange woman  very well known about  here  and there s a foolish parson living near them  up in the hills  who  makes her worse  but it s the son i m thinking of       why  alan  isn t he respectable       not particularly  he s a splendid athletic fellow  doing his best to  make himself a blackguard  i m afraid  i ve come across him once or  twice  as it happens  he s not a desirable cousin for miss fountain  that  i can vouch for  and unluckily   he smiled   miss fountain won t hear any  good of this house at browhead farm      even augustina drew herself up proudly      my dear alan  what does it matter what that sort of people think      he shook his head      it s a queer business  they were mixed up with young williams      augustina started      mrs  mason was a great friend of his mother  who died  they hate me like  poison  however         the priest interposed      mrs  mason is a very violent  a most unseemly woman   he said  in his  mincing voice   and the father  the old man  who is now dead  was  concerned in the rioting near the bridge          when alan was struck  mrs  denton told me  how  abominable       augustina raised her hands in mingled reprobation and distress     helbeck looked annoyed      that doesn t matter one brass farthing   he said  in some haste   father  bowles was much worse treated than i on that occasion  but you see the  whole thing is unlucky  it makes it difficult to give miss fountain the  hints one would like to give her      he threw himself down beside his sister  talking to her in low tones   father bowles took up the local paper     presently augustina broke out  with another wringing of the hands      don t put it on me  my dear alan  i tell you  laura has always done  exactly what she liked since she was a baby      mr  helbeck rose  his face and air already expressed a certain  haughtiness  and at his sister s words there was a very definite  tightening of the shoulders      i do not intend to have hubert mason hanging about the house   he said  quietly  as he thrust his hands into his pockets      of course not   but she wouldn t expect it   cried augustina in dismay    it s the keeping her away from them  that s the difficulty  she thinks  so much of her cousins  alan  they re her father s only relations  i know  she ll want to be with them half her time       for love of them  or dislike of us  oh  i dare say it will be all  right   he added abruptly   father bowles  shall i drive you half way   the pony will be round directly            chapter iv    it was a sunday morning  bright and windy  miss fountain was driving a  shabby pony through the park of bannisdale  driving with a haste and glee  that sent the little cart spinning down the road     six hours  she calculated  till she need see bannisdale again  her  cousins would ask her to dinner and to tea  augustina and mr  helbeck  might have all their sunday antics to themselves  there were several  priests coming to luncheon  and a function in the chapel that afternoon   laura flicked the pony sharply as she thought of it  seven miles between  her and it  joy     nevertheless  she did not get rid of the old house and its suggestions  quite as easily as she wished  the park and the river had many windings   again and again the grey gabled mass thrust itself upon her attention   recalling each time  against her will  the face of its owner     a high brow  hollows in the temples  deep hollows in the cheeks  pale  blue eyes  a short and pointed beard  greyish black like the hair  the  close whiskers black  too  against the skin  a general impression of  pallor  dark lines  strong shadows  melancholy force      she burst out laughing     a pose   nothing in the world but a pose  there was a wretched picture of  charles i  in the dining room  a daub  after  some famous thing  she  supposed  all eyes and hair  long face  and lace collar  mr  helbeck was   made up  to that  she was sure of it  he had found out the likeness  and  improved upon it  oh  if one could only present him with the collar and  blue ribbon complete        cut his head off  and have done with him   she said aloud  whipping up  the pony  and laughing at her own petulance     who could live in such a house  such an atmosphere     as she drove along  her mind was all in a protesting whirl  on her return  from her walk with the dogs the day before  she had found a service going  on in the chapel  father bowles officiating  and some figures in black  gowns and white winged coifs assisting  she had fled to her own room  but  when she came down again  the black garbed  sisters  were still there   and she had been introduced to them  ugh  what manners  must one always   if one was a catholic  make that cloying  hypocritical impression   three  of them kissed me   she reminded herself  in a quiver of wrath     they were sisters from the orphanage apparently  or one of the  orphanages  and there had been endless talk of new buildings and money   while she  laura  sat dumb in her corner looking at old photographs of  the house  helbeck  indeed  had not talked much  while the black women  were chattering with augustina and father bowles  he had stood  mostly  silent  under the picture of his great grandmother  only breaking through  his reverie from time to time to ask or answer a question  was he  pondering the sale of the great grandmother  or did he simply know that  his silence and aloofness were picturesque  that they compelled other  people s attention  and made him the centre of things more effectively  than more ordinary manners could have done  in recalling him the girl had  an impatient sense of something commanding  of something  moreover  that  held herself under observation   one thinks him shy at first  or  awkward  nothing of the sort  he is as proud as lucifer  very soon one  sees that he is just looking out for his own way in everything      and as for temper          after the sisters departed  a young architect had appeared at supper  a  point of difference had arisen between him and mr  helbeck  he was to be  employed  it appeared  in the enlargement of this blessed orphanage  mr   helbeck  no doubt  with a view to his pocket  to do him justice  there  seemed to be no other pocket concerned than his  was of opinion that  certain existing buildings could be made use of in the new scheme  the  architect  a nervous young fellow  with awkward manners  and the  ambitions of an artist  thought not  and held his own  insistently  the  discussion grew vehement  suddenly helbeck lost his temper      mr  munsey  i must ask you to give more weight  if you please  to my  wishes in this matter  they may be right or wrong  but it would save  time  perhaps  if we assumed that they would prevail      the note of anger in the voice made every one look up  the squire stood  erect a moment  crumpled in his hand a half sheet of paper on which young  munsey had been making some calculations  and flung it into the fire   augustina sat cowering  the young man himself turned white  bowed  and  said nothing  while father bowles  of course  like the old tabby that he  was  had at once begun to purr conciliation      would i have stood meek and mum if  i d  been the young man   thought  laura   would i  oh  if i d had the chance  and he should not have made  up so easily  either      for she remembered  also  how  after father bowles was gone  she had come  in from the garden to find mr  helbeck and the architect pacing the long  hall together  on what seemed to be the friendliest of terms  for nearly  an hour  while she and augustina sat reading over the fire  the colloquy  went on     helbeck s tones then were of the gentlest  the young man too spoke low  and eagerly  pressing his plans  and once when laura looked up from her  book  she had seen helbeck s arm resting for a moment on the young  fellow s shoulder  oh  no doubt mr  helbeck could make himself agreeable  when he chose  and struggling architects must put up with the tempers of  their employers     all the more did miss fountain like to think that the squire could compel  no court from her     she recalled that when mr  munsey had said good night  and they three  were alone in the firelit hall  helbeck had come to stand beside her  he  had looked down upon her with an air which was either kindness or  weariness  he had been willing  even  she thought  anxious to talk with  her  but she did not mean to be first trampled on  then patronised  like  the young man  so mr  helbeck had hardly begun  with that occasional  timidity which sat so oddly on his dark and strong physique  to speak to  her of the two sisters of charity who had been his guests in the  afternoon  when she abruptly discovered it was time to say good night   she winced a little as she remembered the sudden stiffening of his look   the careless touch of his hand                                                 the day was keen and clear  a nipping wind blew beneath the bright sun   and the opening buds had a parched and hindered look  but to laura the  air was wine  and the country all delight  she was mounting the flank of  a hill towards a straggling village  straight along the face of the hill  lay her road  past the villages and woods that clothed the hill slope   till someone should show her the gate beyond which lay the rough ascent  to browhead farm     above her  now  to her right  rose a craggy fell with great screes  plunging sheer down into the woods that sheltered the village  below  in  the valley plain  stretched the purples and greens of the moss  the  rivers shone in the sun as they came speeding from the mountains to the  sea  and in the far distance the heights of lakeland made one pageant  with the sun and the clouds  peak after peak thrown blue against the  white  cloud after cloud breaking to show the dappled hills below  in  such a glory of silver and of purple  such a freshness of atmosphere and  light  that mere looking soon became the most thrilling  the most  palpable of joys  laura s spirits began to sing and soar  with the larks  and the blackcaps     then  when the village was gone  came a high stretch of road  looking  down upon the moss and all its bounding fells  which ran out upon its  purple face like capes upon a sea  and these nearer fields  what were  these thick white specks upon the new made furrows  up rose the gulls for  answer  and the girl felt the sea breath from their dazzling wings  and  turned behind her to look for that pale opening in the south west through  which the rivers passed     and beyond the fields a wood  such a wood as made laura s south country  eyes stand wide with wonder  out she jumped  tied the pony s rein to a  gate beside the road  and ran into the hazel brushwood with little cries  of pleasure  a westmoreland wood in daffodil time  it was nothing more  and nothing less  but to this child with the young passion in her blood   it was a dream  an ecstasy  the golden flowers  the slim stalks  rose  from a mist of greenish blue  made by their speary leaf amid the  encircling browns and purples  the intricate stem and branch work of the  still winter bound hazels  never were daffodils in such a wealth before   they were flung on the fell side through a score of acres  in sheets and  tapestries of gold   such an audacious  unreckoned plenty as went  strangely with the frugal air and temper of the northern country  with  the bare walled fields  the ruggedness of the crags above  and the  melancholy of the treeless marsh below  and within this common  lavishness  all possible delicacy  all possible perfection of the  separate bloom and tuft  each foot of ground had its own glory  for below  the daffodils there was a carpet of dark violets  so dim and close that  it was their scent first bewrayed them  and as laura lay gathering with  her face among the flowers  she could see behind their gold  and between  the hazel stems  the light filled greys and azures of the mountain  distance  each detail in the happy whole struck on the girl s eager sense  and made there a poem of northern spring  spring as the fell country sees  it  pure  cold  expectant  with flashes of a blossoming beauty amid the  rocks and pastures  unmatched for daintiness and joy     presently laura found herself sitting  half crying   on a mossy tuft   looking along the wood to the distance  what was it in this exquisite  country that seized upon her so  that spoke to her in this intimate  this  appealing voice     why  she was of it  she belonged to it  she felt it in her veins  old  inherited things leapt within her  or it pleased her to think so  it was  as though she stretched out her arms to the mountains and fields  crying  to them   i am not a stranger  draw me to you  my life sprang from  yours   a host of burning and tender thoughts ran through her  their  first effect was to remind her of the farm and of her cousins  and she  sprang up  and went back to the cart     on they rattled again  downhill through the wood  and up on the further  side  still always on the edge of the moss  she loved the villages  and  their medley of grey houses wedged among the rocks  she loved the stone  farms with their wide porches  and the white splashes on their grey  fronts  she loved the tufts of fern in the wall crannies  the limestone  ribs and bonework of the land breaking everywhere through the pastures   the incomparable purples of the woods  and the first brave leafing of the  larches and the sycamores  never had she so given her heart to any new  world  and through her delight flashed the sorest  tenderest thoughts of  her father   oh  papa  oh  papa   she said to herself again and again in  a little moan  every day perhaps he had walked this road as a child  and  she could still see herself as a child  in a very dim vision  trotting  beside him down the browhead road  she turned at last into the fell gate  to which a passing boy directed her  with a long breath that was almost a  sob     she had given them no notice  but surely  surely they would be glad to  see her      they   she tried to split up the notion  to imagine the three people she  was going to see  cousin elizabeth  the mother  ah  she knew her  for  they had never liked cousin elizabeth  she herself could dimly remember a  hard face  an obstinate voice raised in discussion with her father  yet  it was cousin elizabeth who was the fountain born  who had carried the  little family property as her dowry to her husband james mason  for the  grandfather had been free to leave it as he chose  and on the death of  his eldest son  who had settled at the farm after his marriage  and taken  the heavy work of it off his father s shoulders  the old man had  passionately preferred to leave it to the strong  capable granddaughter   who was already provided with a lover  who understood the land  moreover   and could earn and  addle  as he did  rather than to his bookish milksop  of a second son  so richly provided for already  in his father s  contemptuous opinion  by the small government post at newcastle      let us always thank god  laura  that my grandfather was a brute to  yours   stephen fountain would say to his girl on the rare occasions when  he could be induced to speak of his family at all   but for that i might  be a hedger and ditcher to this day      well  but cousin elizabeth s children  laura herself had some vague  remembrance of them  as the pony climbed the steep lane she shut her eyes  and tried hard to recall them  the fair haired boy  rather fat and  masterful  who had taken her to find the eggs of a truant hen in a hedge  behind the house  and had pushed her into a puddle on the way home  because she had broken one  then the girl  the older girl polly  who had  cleaned her shoes for her  and lent her a pinafore  no  laura opened her  eyes again  it was no good straining to remember  too many years had  rolled between that early visit and her present self  years during which  there had been no communication of any sort between stephen fountain and  his cousins     why had augustina been so trying and tiresome about the masons  instead  of flying to her cousins on the earliest possible opportunity  here was a  whole fortnight gone since her arrival  and it was not till this sunday  morning that laura had been able to achieve her visit  augustina had been  constantly ailing or fretful  either unwilling to be left alone  or  possessed by absurd desires for useless trifles  only to be satisfied by  laura s going to shop in whinthorpe  and such melancholy looks whenever  the masons were mentioned  coupled with so formal a silence on mr   helbeck s part  what did it all mean  no doubt her relations were vulgar   low born folk   but she did not ask mr  helbeck or her stepmother to  entertain them  at last there had been a passage of arms between her and  her stepmother  perhaps mr  helbeck had overheard it  for immediately  afterwards he had emerged from his study into the hall  where she and  augustina were sitting      miss fountain  may i ask  do you wish to be sent into whinthorpe on  sunday morning      she had fronted him at once      no  thank you  mr  helbeck  i don t go to church  i never did with  papa      had she been defiant  he surely had been stiff      then  perhaps you would like the pony  for your visit  he is quite at  your service for the day  would that suit you       perfectly                                                  so here she was  at last   climbing up and up into the heart of the  fells  the cloud pageant round the high mountains  the valley with its  flashing streams  its distant sands  and widening sea  she had risen as  it seemed above them all  they lay beneath her in a map like unity  she  could have laughed and sung out of sheer physical joy in the dancing  air  in the play of the cloud gleams and shadows as they swept across  her  chased by the wind  all about her the little mountain sheep were  feeding in the craggy  intaks  or along the edges of the tiny tumbling  streams  and at intervals amid the reds and yellows of the still wintry  grass rose great wind beaten hollies  sharp and black against the blue  distance  marching beside her  like scattered soldiers  up the height     not a house to be seen  save on the far slopes of distant hills  not a  sound  but the chink of the stone chat  or the fall of lonely water     soon the road  after its long ascent  began to dip  a few trees appeared  in a hollow  then a gate and some grey walls     laura jumped from the cart  beyond the gate  the road turned downward a  little  and a great block of barns shut the farmhouse from view till she  was actually upon it     but there it was at last  the grey  roughly built house  that she still  vaguely remembered  with the whitewashed porch  the stables and cowsheds  opposite  the little garden to the side  the steep fell behind     she stood with her hand on the pony  looking at the house in some  perplexity  not a soul apparently had heard her coming  nothing moved in  the farmhouse or outside it  was everybody at church  but it was nearly  one o clock     the door under the deep porch had no knocker  and she looked in vain for  a bell  all she could do was to rap sharply with the handle of her whip     no answer  she rapped again  louder and louder  at last in the intervals  of knocking  she became conscious of a sound within  something deep and  continuous  like the buzzing of a gigantic bee     she put her ear to the door  listening  then all her face dissolved in  laughter  she raised her arm and brought the whip handle down noisily on  the old blistered door  so that it shook again      hullo      there was a sudden sound of chairs overturned  or dragged along a flagged  floor  then staggering steps  and the door was opened      i say  what s all this  what are you making such a damned noise for      inside stood a stalwart young man  still half asleep  and drawing his  hand irritably across his blinking eyes      how do you do  mr  mason      the young man drew himself together with a start  suddenly he perceived  that the young girl standing in the shade of the porch was not his  sister  but a stranger  he looked at her with astonishment   at the  elegance of her dress  and the neatness of her small gloved hand      i beg your pardon  miss  i m sure  did you want anything      the visitor laughed   yes  i want a good deal  i came up to see my  cousins  you re my cousin  though of course you don t remember me  i  thought  perhaps  you d ask me to dinner      the young man s yawns ceased  he stared with all his eyes  instinctively  putting his hair and collar straight      well  i m afraid i don t know who you are  miss   he said at last   putting out his hand in perplexity to meet hers   will you walk in       not before you know who i am    said laura  still laughing   i m laura  fountain  now do you know       what  stephen fountain s daughter  as married miss helbeck   said the  young man in wonder  his face  which had been at first vague and heavy  with sleep  began to recover its natural expression     laura surveyed him  he had a square  full chin and an upper lip slightly  underhung  his straight fair hair straggled loose over his brow  he  carried his head and shoulders well  and was altogether a finely built   rather magnificent young fellow  marred by a general expression that was  half clumsy  half insolent      that s it   she said  in answer to his question   i m staying at  bannisdale  and i came up to see you all   where s cousin elizabeth       mother  do you mean   oh  she s at church       why aren t you there  too      he opened his blue eyes  taken aback by the cool clearness of her voice      well  i can t abide the parson  if you want to know  shall i put up your  pony       but perhaps you ve not had your sleep out   said laura  politely  interrogative     he reddened  and came forward with a slow and rather shambling gait      i don t know what else there is to do up here of a sunday morning   he  said  with a boyish sulkiness  as he began to lead the pony towards the  stables opposite   besides  i was up half the night seeing to one of the  cows       you don t seem to have many neighbours   said laura  as she walked  beside him      there s rooks and crows   which he pronounced broadly   craws     not  much else  i can tell you  shall i take the pony out       please  i m afraid you ll have to put up with me for hours      she looked at him merrily  and he returned the scrutiny  she wore the  same thin black dress in which helbeck had admired her the day before   and above it a cloth jacket and cap  trimmed with brown fur  mason was  dazzled a moment by the milky whiteness of the cheek above the fur  by  the brightness of the eyes and hair  then was seized with fresh shyness   and became extremely busy with the pony      mother ll be back in about an hour   he said gruffly      goodness  what ll you do with me till then      they both laughed  he with an embarrassment that annoyed him  he was not  at all accustomed to find himself at a disadvantage with a good looking  girl      there s a good fire in the house  anyway   he said   you ll want to warm  yourself  i should think  after driving up here       oh  i m not cold  i say  what jolly horses      for mason had thrown open the large worm eaten door of the stables  and  inside could be seen the heads and backs of two cart horses  huge   majestic creatures  who were peering over the doors of their stalls  as  though they had been listening to the conversation     their owner glanced at them indifferently      aye  they re not bad  we bred  em three years ago  and they ve taken  more n one prize already  i dare say old daffady  now  as looks after  them  would be sorry to part with them       i dare say he would  but why should he part with them      the young man hesitated  he was shaking down a load of hay for the pony   and laura was leaning against the door of the stall watching his  performance      well  i reckon we shan t be farmin here all our lives   he said at last  with some abruptness      don t you like it then       i d get quit on it to morrow if i could      his quick reply had an emphasis that astonished her      and your mother       oh  of course it s mother keeps me at it   he said  relapsing into the  same accent of a sulky child that he had used once before     then he led his new cousin back to the farmhouse  by this time he was  beginning to find his tongue and use his eyes  laura was conscious that  she was being closely observed  and that by a man who was by no means  indifferent to women  she said to herself that she would try to keep him  shy     as they entered the farmhouse kitchen mason hastened to pick up the  chairs he had overturned in his sudden waking      i say  mother would be mad if she knew you d come into this scrow   he  said with vexation  kicking aside some sporting papers that were littered  over the floors  and bringing forward a carved oak chair with a cushion  to place it before the fire for her acceptance      scrow  what s that   said laura  lifting her eyebrows   oh  please don t  tidy any more  i really think you make it worse  besides  it s all right   what a dear old kitchen      she had seated herself in the cushioned chair  and was warming a slender  foot at the fire  mason wished she would take off her hat  it hid her  hair  but he could not flatter himself that she was in the least occupied  with what he wished  her attention was all given to her surroundings  to  the old raftered room  with its glowing fire and deep set windows     bright as the april sun was outside  it hardly penetrated here  through  the mellow dusk  as through the varnish of an old picture  one saw the  different objects in a golden light and shade  the brass warming pan  hanging beside the tall eight day clock  the table in front of the long  window seat  covered with its checked red cloth  the carved door of a  cupboard in the wall bearing the date       the miscellaneous store of  things packed away under the black rafters  dried herbs and tools   bundles of list and twine  the spindles of old spinning wheels   cattle medicines  and the like  the heavy oaken chairs  the settle beside  the fire  with its hard cushions and scrolled back  it was a room for  winter  fashioned by the needs of winter  by the help of that great peat  fire  built up year by year from the spoils of the moss a thousand feet  below  generations of human beings had fought with snow and storm  had  maintained their little polity there on the heights  self centred   self supplied  across the yard  commanded by the window of the  farm kitchen  lay the rude byres where the cattle were prisoned from  october to april  the cattle made the wealth of the farm  and there must  be many weeks when the animals and their masters were shut in together  from the world outside by wastes of snow     laura shut her eyes an instant  imagining the goings to and fro  the  rising on winter dawns to feed the stock  the shepherd on the fell side   wrestling with sleet and tempest  the returns at night to food and fire   her young fancy  already played on by the breath of the mountains  warmed  to the farmhouse and its primitive life  here surely was something more  human  more poetic even  than the tattered splendour of bannisdale     she opened her eyes wide again  as though in defiance  and saw hubert  mason looking at her     instinctively she sat up straight  and drew her foot primly under the  shelter of her dress      i was thinking of what it must be in winter   she said hurriedly   i  know i should like it       what  this place   he gave a rough laugh   i don t see what for  then   it s bad enough in summer  in winter it s fit to make you cut your  throat  i say  where are you staying       why  at bannisdale   said laura in surprise   you knew my stepmother was  still living  didn t you       well  i didn t think aught about it   he said  falling into candour   because the beauty of her grey eyes  now that they were fixed fair and  full upon him  startled him out of his presence of mind      i wrote to you  to cousin elizabeth  when my father died   she said  simply  rather proudly  and the eyes were removed from him      aye  of course you did   he said in haste   but mother s never yan to  talk aboot letters  and you haven t dropped us a line since  have you    he added  almost with timidity      no  i thought i d surprise you  we ve been a fortnight at bannisdale      his face flushed and darkened      then you ve been a fortnight in a queer place   he said with a sudden   almost a violent change of tone   i wonder you can bide so long under  that man s roof      she stared      do you mean because he disliked my father       oh  i don t know nowt about that   he paused  his young face was  crimson  his eyes angry and sinister   he s a  snake   is helbeck   he  said slowly  striking his hands together as they hung over his knees     laura recoiled  instinctively straightening herself      mr  helbeck is quite kind to me   she said sharply   i don t know why  you speak of him like that  i m staying there till my stepmother gets  strong      he stared at her  still red and obstinate      helbeck an his house together stick in folk s gizzards aboot here   he  said   yo ll soon find that oot  and good reason too  did you ever hear  of teddy williams       williams   she said  frowning   was that the man that painted the  chapel      mason laughed and slapped his knee      man  indeed  he was just a lad  down at marsland school  i was there  myself  you understand  the year after him  he was an awful clever  lad  beat every one at books  an he could draw anything  you couldn t  mak  much oot of his drawins  i daur say  they were queer sorts o   things  i never could make head or tail on  em myself  but old jackson   our master  thowt a lot of  em  and so did the passon down at marsland   an his father an mother  well  they thowt he was going to make all their  fortunes for  em  there was a scholarship  or soomthin o  that sort  an  he was to get it an go to college  an make  em all rich  they were just  common wheelwrights  you understand  down on t  whinthorpe road  but my  word  mr  helbeck spoilt their game for  em      he lifted another sod of turf from the basket and flung it on the fire   the animus of his tone and manner struck laura oddly  but she was at  least as curious to hear as he was anxious to tell  she drew her chair a  little nearer to him      what did mr  helbeck do      mason laughed      well  he just made a papist of teddy  took him an done him  brown  he  got hold on him in the park one evening  teddy was drawing a picture of  the bridge  you understand   ticed him up to his place soomhow  an teddy  was set to a job of paintin up at the chapel before you could say jack  robinson  an in six months they d settled it between  em  teddy wouldn t  go to school no more  and one night he and his father had words  the owd  man gie d him a thrashing  and teddy just cut and run  next thing they  heard he was at a papist school  somewhere over lancashire way  an he  sent word to his mother  she was dyin then  you understan   and she s  dead since  that he d gone to be a priest  an if they didn t like it   they might just do the other thing       and the mother died   said laura      aye  double quick  my mother went down to nurse her  an they sent teddy  back  just too late to see her  he come in two three hours after they d  screwed her down  an his father chivvyed him oot  they wouldn t have him  at the funeral  but folks were a deal madder with mr  helbeck  you  understan   nor with teddy  teddy s father and brothers are chapel  folk  primitive methodists they call  em  they ve got a big chapel in  whinthorpe  an they raised the whole place on mr  helbeck  and one night   coming out of whinthorpe  he was set on by a lot of fellows  chapel  fellows  a bit fresh  you understan   father was there  he never denied  it  not he  helbeck just got into the old mill by the bridge in time  but  they d marked his face for him all the same       ah   said laura  staring into the fire  she had just remembered a dark  scar on mr  helbeck s forehead  under the strong ripples of black hair    go on  do       oh  afterwards there was a lot of men bound over  father among  em   there was a priest with mr  helbeck who got it hot too  that old chap  bowles  i dare say you ve seen him  aye  he s a  snake   is helbeck   the  young man repeated  then he reddened still more deeply  and added with  vindictive emphasis   and an interfering   hypocritical   canting sort of  party into t  bargain  he d like to lord it over everybody aboot here  if  he was let  but he s as poor as a church rat  who minds him      the language was extraordinary  so was the tone  laura had been gazing at  the speaker in a growing amazement      thank you   she said impetuously  when mason stopped   thank you   but   in spite of your story  i don t think you ought to speak like that of the  gentleman i am staying with      mason threw himself back in his chair  he was evidently trying to control  himself      i didn t mean no offence   he said at last  with a return of the sulky  voice   of course i understand that you re staying with the quality  and  not with the likes of us      laura s face lit up with laughter   what an extraordinary silly thing to  say  but i don t mind  i ll forgive you  like i did years ago  when you  pushed me into the puddle       i pushed you into a puddle  but  i never did owt o  t  sort   cried  mason  in a slow crescendo of astonishment      oh  yes  you did   she nodded her little head   i broke an egg  and you  bullied me  of course i thought you were a horrid boy  and i loved polly   who cleaned my shoes and put me straight  where s polly  is she at  church       aye  i dare say   said mason stupidly  watching his visitor meanwhile  with all his eyes  she had just put up a small hand and taken off her  cap  now  mechanically  she began to pat and arrange the little curls  upon her forehead  then to take out and replace a hairpin or two  so as  to fasten the golden mass behind a little more securely  the white  fingers moved with an exquisite sureness and daintiness  the lifted arms  showed all the young curves of the girl s form     suddenly laura turned to him again  her eyes had been staring dreamily  into the fire  while her hands had been busy with her hair      so you don t remember our visit at all  you don t remember papa      he shook his head      ah  well   she sighed  mason felt unaccountably guilty      i was always terr ble bad at remembering   he said hastily      but you ought to have remembered papa   then  in quite a different  voice   is this your sitting room   she looked round it   or  or your  kitchen      the last words fell rather timidly  lest she might have hurt his  feelings     mason jumped up      why  yon s the parlour   he said   i should ha  taken you there fust  thing  will you coom  i ll soon make a fire      and walking across the kitchen  he threw open a further door  ceremoniously  laura followed  pausing just inside the threshold to look  round the little musty sitting room  with its framed photographs  its  woollen mats  its rocking chairs  and its square of mustard coloured  carpet  mason watched her furtively all the time  to see how the place  struck her      oh  this isn t as nice as the kitchen   she said decidedly   what s  that   she pointed to a pewter cup standing stately and alone upon the  largest possible wool mat in the centre of a table     mason threw back his head and chuckled  his great chest seemed to fill  out  all his sulky constraint dropped away      of course you don t know anythin aboot these parts   he said to her with  condescension   you don t know as i came near bein champion for the  county lasst year  no  i ll reckon you don t  oh  that cup s nowt  that s  nobbut whinthorpe sports  lasst december  maybe there ll be a better  there  by and by      the young giant grinned  as he took up the cup and pointed with assumed  indifference to its inscription      what  football   said laura  putting up her hand to hide a yawn   oh  i  don t care about football  but i  love  cricket  why  you ve got a  piano  and a new one      mason s face cleared again  in quite another fashion      do you know the maker   he said eagerly   i believe he s thowt a deal of  by them as knows  i bought it myself out o  the sheep  the lambs had done  fust rate   an i d had more n half the trooble of  em  ony ways  so i  took no heed o  mother  i went down straight to whinthrupp  an paid the  first instalment an browt it up in the cart mesel   mr  castle  do yo  knaw  im   he s the organist at the parish church  he came with me to  choose it       and is it you that play it   said laura wondering   or your sister      he looked at her in silence for a moment  and she at him  his aspect  seemed to change under her eyes  the handsome points of the face came  out  its coarseness and loutishness receded  and his manner became  suddenly quiet and manly  though full of an almost tremulous eagerness      you like it   she asked him      what  music  i should think so       oh  i forgot  you re all musical in these northern parts  aren t you      he made no answer  but sat down to the piano and opened it  she leant  over the back of a chair  watching him  half incredulous  half amused      i say  did you ever hear this  i believe it was some cambridge fellow  made it  castle said so  he played it to me  and i can t get further than  just a bit of it      he raised his great hands and brought them down in a burst of chords that  shook the little room and the raftered ceiling  laura stared  he played  on  played like a musician  though with occasional stumbling  played with  a mingled energy and delicacy  an understanding and abandonment that  amazed her  then grew crimson with the effort to remember  wavered  and  stopped      goodness    cried laura   why  that s stanford s music to the eumenides   how on earth did you hear that  go away  i can play it      she pushed him away and sat down  he hung over her  his face smiling and  transformed  while her little hands struggled with the chords  found the  after melody  pursued it   with pauses now and then  in which he would  strike in  prompting her  putting his hand down with hers  and finally   after modulations which she made her way through  with laughter and  head shakings  she fell into a weird dance  to which he beat time with  hands and limbs  urging her with a rain of comments      oh  my goody  isn t that rousing  play that again  just that  change  just once  oh  lord  isn t that good  that chord  and that bit  afterwards  what a bass   i say   isn t  it a bass  don t you like  it  don t you like it  awfully       suddenly she wheeled round from the piano  and sat fronting him  her  hands on her knees  he fell back into a chair      i say   he said slowly   you are a grand  un  if i d only known you  could play like that      her laugh died away  to his amazement she began to frown      i haven t played  ten notes  since papa died  he liked it so      she  turned her back to him  and began to look at the torn music at the  top of the piano      but you will play  you ll play to me again   he said  beseechingly    why  it would be a sin if you didn t play  wouldn t i  play if i could play like you  i never had more than a lesson  now and  again  from old castle  i used to steal mother s eggs to pay him  i can  play any thing i hear  and i ve made a song  old castle s writing it  down  he says he ll teach me to do it some day  but of course i m no good  for playing  i never shall be any good  look at those fingers  they re  like bits of stick  beastly things      he thrust them out indignantly for her inspection  laura looked at them  with a professional air      i don t call it a bad hand  i expect you ve no patience       haven t i  i tell you i d play all day  if it ld do any good  but it  won t       and how about the poor farm   said laura  with a lifted brow      oh  the farm  the farm  dang the farm    said mason violently  slapping  his knee     suddenly there was a sound of voices outside  a clattering on the stones  of the farmyard     mason sprang up  all frowns      that s mother  here  let s shut the piano  quick  she can t abide it            chapter v    mason went out to meet his mother  and laura waited  she stood where she  had risen  beside the piano  looking nervously towards the door  childish  remembrances and alarms seemed to be thronging back into her mind     there was a noise of voices in the outer room  then a handle was roughly  turned  and laura saw before her a short  stout woman  with grey hair   and the most piercing black eyes  intimidated by the eyes  and by the  sudden pause of the newcomer on the threshold  miss fountain could only  look at her interrogatively      is it cousin elizabeth   she said  holding out a wavering hand     mrs  mason scarcely allowed her own to be touched      we re not used to visitors i  church time   she said abruptly  in a deep  funereal voice   mappen you ll sit down      and still holding the girl with her eyes  she walked across to an old  rocking chair  let herself fall into it  and with a loud sigh loosened  her bonnet strings     laura  in her amazement  had to strangle a violent inclination to laugh   then she flushed brightly  and sat down on the wooden stool in front of  the piano  mrs  mason  still staring at her  seemed to wait for her to  speak  but laura would say nothing      soa  thoo art stephen fountain s dowter  art tha       yes  and you have seen me before   was the girl s quiet reply     she said to herself that her cousin had the eyes of a bird of prey  so  black and fierce they were  in the greyish white face under the shaggy  hair  but she was not afraid  rather she felt her own temper rising      how long is t sen your feyther deed       nine months  but you knew that  i think  because i wrote it you      mrs  mason s heavy lids blinked a moment  then she said with slowly  quickening emphasis  like one mounting to a crisis      wat art tha doin  wi  bannisdale hall  what call has thy feyther s  dowter to be visitin onder alan helbeck s roof      laura s open mouth showed first wonderment  then laughter      oh  i see   she said impatiently   you don t seem to understand  but of  course you remember that my father married miss helbeck for his second  wife       aye  an she cam oot fra amang them   exclaimed mrs  mason   she put away  from her the accursed thing      the massive face was all aglow  transformed  with a kind of sombre fire   laura stared afresh      she gave up being a catholic  if that s what you mean   she said after a  moment s pause   but she couldn t keep to it  when papa fell ill  and she  was unhappy  she went back  and then of course she made it up with her  brother      the triumph in mrs  mason s face yielded first to astonishment  then to  anger      the poor weak doited thing   she said at last in a tone of indescribable  contempt   the poor silly fule  but naebody need ha  luked for onything  betther from a helbeck   and i daur say   she lifted her voice  fiercely   i daur say she took yo  wi  her  an it s along o  thattens as  yo re coom to spy on us oop here      laura sprang up      me   she said indignantly   you think i m a catholic and a spy  how kind  of you  but of course you don t know anything about my father  nor how he  brought me up  as for my poor little stepmother  i came here with her to  get her well  and i shall stay with her till she is well  i really don t  know why you talk to me like this  i suppose you have cause to dislike  mr  helbeck  but it is very odd that you should visit it on me  papa s  daughter  when i come to see you      the girl s voice trembled  but she threw back her slender neck with a  gesture that became her  the door  which had been closed  stealthily  opened  hubert mason s face appeared in the doorway  it was gazing  eagerly  admiringly  at miss fountain     mrs  mason did not see him  nor was she daunted by laura s anger      it s aw yan   she said stubbornly   thoo ha  made a covenant wi  the  amorite an the amalekite  they ha  called tha  an thoo art eatin o  their  sacrifices      there was an uneasy laugh from the door  and laura  turning her  astonished eyes in that direction  perceived hubert standing in the  doorway  and behind him another head thrust eagerly forward  the head of  a young woman in a much betrimmed sunday hat      i say  mother  let her be  wil tha   said a hearty voice  and  pushing  hubert aside  the owner of the hat entered the room  she went up to  laura  and gave her a loud kiss      i m polly  polly mason  an i know who you are weel enough  doan t you  pay ony attention to mother  that s her way  hubert an i take it very  kind of you to come and see us       mother s rats on amorites   said hubert  grinning      rats   amorites    said laura  looking piteously at polly  whose hand  she held     polly laughed  a bouncing  good humoured laugh  she herself was a  bouncing  good humoured person  the apparent antithesis of her mother  with her lively eyes  her frizzled hair  her high cheek bones touched  with a bright pink      yo ll have to get oop early to understan  them two   she declared    mother s allus talkin out o  t  bible  an hubert picks up a lot o  low  words out o  whinthrupp streets  an there  tis  but now look here  yo ll  stay an tak  a bit o  dinner with us       i don t want to be in your way   said laura formally  really  she had  some difficulty to control the quiver of her lips  though it would have  been difficult to say whether laughter or tears came nearest     at this polly broke out in voluble protestations  investigating her  cousin s dress all the time  fingering her little watch chain  and even  taking up a corner of the pretty cloth jacket that she might examine the  quality of it  laura  however  looked at mrs  mason      if cousin elizabeth wishes me to stay   she said proudly     polly burst into another loud laugh      yo see  it goes agen mother to be shakin hands wi  yan that s livin wi   papists  and misther helbeck by the bargain  so wheniver mother talks  aboot amorites or jesubites  or any o  thattens  she nobbut means  papist  romanists as our minister coes  em  he s every bit as bad as her   he would as lief shake hands wi  mr  helbeck as wi  the owd  un       i ll uphowd ye  mr  bayley hasn t preached a sermon this ten year wi oot  chivvyin papists   said hubert from the door   an yo ll not find yan o   them in his parish if yo were to hunt it wi  a lantern for a week o   sundays  when i was a lad i thowt romanists were a soart o  varmin  i  awmost looked to see  em nailed to t  barndoor  same as stoeats       but how strange   cried laura   when there are so few catholics about  here  and no one  hates  catholics now  one may just  despise them      she looked from mother to son in bewilderment  not only hubert s speech   but his whole manner had broadened and coarsened since his mother s  arrival      well  if there isn t mony  they make a deal o  talk   said  polly   onyways sence mr  helbeck came to t  hall   mother  i ll take  miss fountain oopstairs  to get her hat off      during all the banter of her son and daughter mrs  mason had sat in a  disdainful silence  turning her strange eyes  the eyes of a fanatic  in a  singularly shrewd and capable face  now on laura  now on her children   laura looked at her again  irresolute whether to go or stay  then an  impulse seized her which astonished herself  for it was an impulse of  liking  an impulse of kinship  and as she quickly crossed the room to  mrs  mason s side  she said in a pretty pleading voice      but you see  cousin elizabeth  i m not a catholic  and papa wasn t a  catholic  and i couldn t help mrs  fountain going back to her old  religion  you shouldn t visit it on me      mrs  mason looked up      why art tha not at church on t  lord s day      the question came stern and quick     laura wavered  then drew herself up      because i m not your sort either  i don t believe in your church  or  your ministers  father didn t  and i m like him      her voice had grown thick  and she was quite pale  the old woman stared  at her      then yo re nobbut yan o  the heathen   she said with slow precision      i dare say   cried laura  half laughing  half crying   that s my affair   but i declare i think i hate catholics as much as you  there  cousin  elizabeth  i don t hate my stepmother  of course  i promised father to  take care of her  but that s another matter       dost tha hate alan helbeck   said mrs  mason suddenly  her black eyes  opening in a flash     the girl hesitated  caught her breath  then was seized with the  strangest  most abject desire to propitiate this grim woman with the  passionate look      yes   she said wildly   no  no   that s silly  i haven t had time to  hate him  but i don t like him  anyway  i m nearly sure i  shall  hate  him      there was no mistaking the truth in her tone     mrs  mason slowly rose  her chest heaved with one long breath  then  subsided  her brow tightened  she turned to her son      art tha goin to let daffady do all thy work for tha   she said sharply    has t  roan calf bin looked to       aye  i m going   said hubert evasively  and sheepishly straightening  himself he made for the front door  throwing back more than one look as  he departed at his new cousin      and you really want me to stay   repeated laura insistently  addressing  mrs  mason      yo re welcome   was the stiff reply   nobbut yo d been mair welcome if  yo hadna brokken t  sabbath to coom here  mappen yo ll goa wi  polly  an  tak  your bonnet off      laura hesitated a moment longer  bit her lip  and went                                                 polly mason was a great talker  in the few minutes she spent with laura  upstairs  before she hurried down again to help her mother with the  sunday dinner  she asked her new cousin innumerable questions  showing an  intense curiosity as to bannisdale and the helbecks  a burning desire to  know whether laura had any money of her own  or was still dependent upon  her stepmother  and a joyous appropriative pride in miss fountain s  gentility and good looks     the frankness of polly s flatteries  and the exuberance of her whole  personality  ended by producing a certain stiffness in laura  every now  and then  in the intervals of polly s questions  when she ceased to be  inquisitive and became confidential  laura would wonder to herself  she  would half shut her eyes  trying to recall the mental image of her  cousins and of the farm  with which she had started that morning from  bannisdale  or she would think of her father  his modes of life and  speech  was he really connected  and how  with this place and its  inmates  she had expected something simple and patriarchal  she had found  a family of peasants  living in a struggling  penurious way  a grim  mother speaking broad dialect  a son with no pretensions to refinement or  education  except perhaps through his music  and a daughter        laura turned an attentive eye on polly  on her high and red cheek bones   the extravagant fringe that vulgarised all her honest face  the sunday  dress of stone coloured alpaca  profusely trimmed with magenta ribbons      i will  i  will  like her   she said to herself   i am a horrid   snobbish  fastidious little wretch      but her spirits had sunk  when polly left her she leant for a moment upon  the sill of the open window  and looked out  across the dirty  uneven  yard  where the manure lay in heaps outside the byre doors  she saw the  rude farm buildings huddled against each other in a mean  unsightly  group  down below  from the house porch apparently  a cracked bell began  to ring  and from some doors opposite three labourers  the  hired men    who lived and boarded on the farm  came out  the first two were elderly  men  gnarled and bent like tough trees that have fought the winter  the  third was a youth  they were tidily dressed in sunday clothes  for their  work was done  and they were ready for the afternoon s holiday     they walked across to the farmhouse in silence  one behind the other  not  even the young fellow raised his eyes to the window and the girl framed  within it  behind them came a gust of piercing easterly wind  a cloud had  covered the sun  the squalid farmyard  the bare fell side beyond it  the  distant levels of the marsh  had taken to themselves a cold forbidding  air  laura again imagined it in december  a waste of snow  with the farm  making an ugly spot upon the white  and the little black bearded sheep  she could see feeding on the fell  crowding under the rocks for shelter   but this time she shivered  all the spell was broken  to live up here  with this madwoman  this strange youth  and polly  yet it seemed to her  that something drew her to cousin elizabeth  if she were not so mad  how  strange to find this abhorrence of mr  helbeck among these people  so  different  so remote  she remembered her own words   i am sure i  shall   hate him    not without a stab of conscience  what had she been  doing  perhaps  but adding her own injustice to theirs     she stood lost in a young puzzle and heat of feeling  half angry  half  repentant     but only for a second  then certain phrases of augustina s rang through  her mind  she saw herself standing in the corner of the chapel while the  others prayed  every pulse tightened  her whole nature leapt again in  defiance  she seemed to be holding something at bay  a tyrannous power  that threatened humiliation and hypocrisy  that seemed at the same time  to be prying into secret things  things it should never  never know  and  never rule  yes  she did understand cousin elizabeth  she  did                                                  the dinner went sadly  the viands were heavy  so were the faces of the  labourers  and the air of the low raftered kitchen  heated as it was by a  huge fire  and pervaded by the smell from the farmyard  laura felt it all  very strange  the presence of the farm servants at the same table with  the masons and herself  the long silences that no one made an effort to  break  the relations between hubert and his mother     as for the labourers  mason addressed them now and then in a bullying  voice  and they spoke to him as little as they could  it seemed to laura  that there was an alliance between them and the mother against a lazy and  incompetent master  and that the lad s vanity was perpetually alive to  it  again and again he would pull himself together  attempt the  gentleman  and devote himself to his young lady guest  but in the midst  of their conversation he would hear something at the other end of the  table  and suddenly there would come a burst of fierce unintelligible  speech between him and the mistress of the house  while the labourers sat  silent and sly  and polly s loud laugh would break in  trying to make  peace     laura s cool grey eyes followed the youth with a constant critical  wonder  in any other circumstances she would not have thought him worth  an instant s attention  she had all the supercilious impatience of the  pretty girl accustomed to choose her company  but this odd fact of  kinship held and harassed her  she wanted to understand these masons  her  father s folk      now he is really talking quite nicely   she said to herself on one  occasion  when hubert had found in the gifts and accomplishments of his  friend castle  the organist  a subject that untied his tongue and made  him almost agreeable  suddenly a question caught his ear      daffady  did tha turn the coo   said his mother in a loud voice  even in  the homeliest question it had the same penetrating  passionate quality  that belonged to her gaze  to her whole personality indeed     hubert dropped his phrase  and his knife and fork  and stared angrily at  daffady  the old cowman and carter     daffady threw his master a furtive look  then munched through a mouthful  of bread and cheese without replying     he was a grey and taciturn person  with a provocative look of patience      what tha bin doin wi  th  coo   said hubert sharply   i left her mysel  nobbut half an hour sen      daffady turned his head again in hubert s direction for a moment  then  deliberately addressed the mistress      aye  aye  missus   he spoke in a high small voice   a turned her reet  enoof  an a gied her soom fresh straa for her yed  she doin varra  middlin       if she d been turned yesterday in a proper fashion  she d ha  bin on her  feet by now   said mrs  mason  with a glance at her son      nowt o  t  soart  mother   cried hubert  he leant forward  flushed with  wrath  or beer  his potations had begun to fill laura with dismay  and  spoke with a hectoring violence   i tell tha when t  farrier cam oop last  night  he said she d been managed first rate  if yo and daffady had yor  way wi  yor fallals an yor nonsense  yo d never leave a poor sick creetur  alone for five minutes  i towd daffady to let her be  an i ll let him  knaa who s measter here      he glared at the carter  quite regardless of laura s presence  polly  coughed loudly  and tried to make a diversion by getting up to clear away  the plates  the three combatants took no notice     daffady slowly ran his tongue round his lips  then he said  again looking  at the mistress      if a hadna turned her i dew believe she d ha  gien oos t  slip  she was  terr ble swollen as  twos       i tell tha to let her be   thundered hubert   if she deas  that s ma  consarn  i ll ha  noa meddlin wi  my orders  dost tha hear       aye  it wor thirrty poond thraan awa lasst month  an it ll be thirrty  poond this   said his mother slowly   thoo art fine at shoutin  bit thy  fadther had need ha  addlet his brass  to gie thee summat to thraw oot o   winder      hubert rose from the table with an oath  stood for an instant looking  down at laura   glowering  and pulling fiercely at his moustache   then   noisily opening the front door  he strode across the yard to the byres     there was an instant s silence  then mrs  mason rose with her hands  clasped before her  her eyes half closed      for what we ha  received  the lord mak  us truly thankful   she said in  a loud  nasal voice   amen                                                  after dinner  laura put on an apron of polly s  and helped her cousin to  clear away  mrs  mason had gruffly bade her sit still  but when the girl  persisted  she herself  flushed with dinner and combat  took her seat on  the settle  opposite to old daffady  and deliberately made holiday   watching stephen s daughter all the time from the black eyes that roved  and shone so strangely under the shaggy brows and the white hair     the old cowman sat hunched over the fire  smoking his pipe for a time in  beatific silence     but presently laura  as she went to and fro  caught snatches of  conversation      did tha go ta laysgill last sunday   said mrs  mason abruptly     daffady removed his pipe      aye  a went  an a preeched  it wor a varra stirrin meetin  sum o  yor  paid preests sud ha  bin theer  a gien it  em strang  a tried ta hit  em  all  baith gert an lile      there was a pause  then he added placidly      a likely suden t suit them varra weel  theer was a mon beside me  as  pooed me down afoor a d hofe doon       tha sudna taak o   paid preests   daffady   said mrs  mason severely    tha doosna understand nowt o  thattens      daffady glanced slyly at his mistress  at the  church pride  implied in  the attitude of her capacious form  in the shining of the sunday alpaca  and black silk apron      mebbe not   he said mildly   mebbe not   and he resumed his pipe     on another occasion  as laura went flitting across the kitchen  drawing  to herself the looks of both its inmates  she heard what seemed to be a  fragment of talk about a funeral      aye  poor jenny   said mrs  mason   they didna mak  mich account on her  whan t  breath wor yanst oot on her       nay    daffady shook his head for sympathy    it wor a varra poor  set oot  wor jenny s buryin  nowt but tay  an sic like      mrs  mason raised two gaunt hands and let them drop again on her knee      i shud ha  thowt they d ha  bin ashamed   she said   jenny s brass ull  do  em noa gude  she wor a fule to leave it to  un      daffady withdrew his pipe again  his lantern jawed face  furrowed with  slow thought  hung over the blaze      aye   he said   aye  wal  i ve buried three childer  an i m nobbut a  labrin mon  but a thank the lord i ha buried them aw  wi  ham      the last words came out with solemnity  laura  at the other end of the  kitchen  turned open mouthed to look at the pair  not a feature moved in  either face  she sped back into the dairy  and polly looked up in  astonishment      what ails tha   she said      oh  nothing   said laura  dashing the merry tears from her eyes  she  proceeded to roll up her sleeves  and plunge her hands and arms into the  bowl of warm water that polly had set before her  meanwhile  polly  very  big and square  much reddened also by the fuss of household work  stood  just behind her cousin s shoulder  looking down  half in envy  half in  admiration  at the slimness of the white wrists and pretty fingers     a little later the two girls  all traces of their housework removed  came  back into the kitchen  daffady and mrs  mason had disappeared      where is cousin elizabeth   said laura rather sharply  as she looked  round her     polly explained that her mother was probably shut up in her bedroom  reading her bible  that was her custom on a sunday afternoon      why  i haven t spoken to her at all   cried laura  her cheek had  flushed     polly showed embarrassment      next time yo coom  mother ll tak  mair noatice  she was takkin stock o   you t  whole time  i ll uphowd yo       that isn t what i wanted   said laura     she walked to the window and leaned her head against the frame  polly  watched her with compunction  seeing quite plainly the sudden drop of the  lip  all she could do was to propose to show her cousin the house     laura languidly consented     so they wandered again through the dark stone slabbed dairy  with its  milk pans on the one side and its bacon curing troughs on the other  and  into the little stuffy bedrooms upstairs  each with its small oak  four poster and patchwork counterpane  they looked at the home made quilt  of goosedown  polly s handiwork  that lay on hubert s bed  at the  clusters of faded photographs and coloured prints that hung on the old  uneven walls  at the vast meal ark in polly s room that held the family  store of meal and oatcake for the year      when we wor little  uns  fadther used to give me an hubert a silver  saxpence the day he browt home t  fresh melder fro  t  mill   said polly    theer was parlish little nobbut paritch and oatcake to eat when we wor  small  an now i ll uphold yo there isn t a farm servant but wants his  white bread yanst a day whativver happens      the house was neat and clean  but there were few comforts in it  and no  luxuries  it showed  too  a number of small dilapidations that a very  little money and care would soon have set to rights  polly pointed to  them sadly  there was no money  and hubert didn t trouble himself    fadther was allus workin  he d be up at half past four this time o   year  an he didna go to bed soa early noather  but hubert ull do nowt he  can help  yo can hardly get him to tak  t  peaets i  ter whinthorpe when  t  peaet cote s brastin wi   em  an as fer doin a job o  cartin fer t   neebors  t  horses may be eatin their heads off  hubert woan t stir  hissel    let  em lead their aan muck for theirsels   that s what he ll  say  iver sen fadther deed it s bin janglin atwixt mother an hubert  it  makes her mad to see iverything goin downhill  an he s that masterful he  woan t be towd  yo saw how he went on wi  daffady at dinner  but if it  weren t for daffady an us  there d be no stock left      and poor polly  sitting on the edge of the meal ark and dangling her  large feet  went into a number of plaintive details  that were mostly  unintelligible  sometimes repulsive  in laura s ears     it seemed that hubert was always threatening to leave the farm   give me  a bit of money  and you ll soon be quit of me  i ll go to froswick  and  make my fortune   that was what he d say to his mother  but who was going  to give him money to throw about  and he couldn t sell the farm while  mrs  mason lived  by the father s will     as to her mother  polly admitted that she was  gey ill to live wi     there was no one like her for  addlin a bit here and addlin a bit there    she was the best maker and seller of butter in the country side  but she  had been queer about religion ever since an illness that attacked her as  a young woman     and now it was mr  bayley  the minister  who excited her  and made her  worse  polly  for her part  hated him   my worrd  he do taak   said she   and every sunday he preached against catholics  and the pope  and such  like  and as there were no catholics anywhere near  but mr  helbeck at  bannisdale  and a certain number at whinthorpe  people didn t know what  to make of him  and they laughed at him  and left off going  except  occasionally for curiosity  because he preached in a black gown  which   so polly heard tell  was very uncommon nowadays  but mother would listen  to him by the hour  and it was all along of teddy williams  it was that  had set her mad     here  however  polly broke off to ask an eager question  what had mr   helbeck said when laura told him of her wish to go and see her cousins      i ll warrant he wasn t best pleased  feyther couldn t abide him  because  of teddy  he didn t thraw no stones that neet i  whinthrupp lane  feyther  was a strict man and read his bible reg lar  but he stood wi  t  lads an  looked on  he didn t say owt to stop  em  mr  helbeck called to him  he  had a priest with him   mr  mason   he ses   this is an old man  speak to  those fellows   but feyther wouldn t   let  em trounce tha   he  ses   aye  an him too  it ull do tha noa harm    well  an what did he  say  mr  helbeck   i d like to know       say  nothing  except that it was a long way  and i might have the pony  carriage      laura s tone was rather dry  she was sitting on the edge of polly s bed   with her arm round one of its oaken posts  her cheek was laid against the  post  and her eyes had been wandering about a good deal while polly  talked  till the mention of helbeck  then her attention came back  and  during polly s account of the incident in whinthorpe lane  she began to  frown  what bigotry  after all  as to the story of young williams  it was  very perplexing  she would get the truth of it out of augustina  but it  was extraordinary that it should be so well known in this upland  farm  that it should make a kind of link  a link of hatred  between mr   helbeck and the masons  after her movement of wild sympathy with mrs   mason  she realised now  as polly s chatter slipped on  that she  understood her cousins almost as little as she did helbeck     nay  more  the picture of helbeck stoned and abused by these rough   uneducated folk had begun to rouse in her a curious sympathy  unwillingly  her mind invested him with a new dignity     so that when polly told a rambling story of how mr  bayley  after the  street fight  had met mr  helbeck at a workhouse meeting and had placed  his hands behind his back when mr  helbeck offered his own  laura tossed  her head      what a ridiculous man   she said disdainfully   what can it matter to  mr  helbeck whether mr  bayley shakes hands with him or not      polly looked at her in some astonishment  and dropped the subject  the  elder woman  conscious of plainness and inferiority  was humbly anxious  to please her new cousin  the girl s delicate and characteristic  physique  her clear eyes and decided ways  and a certain look she had in  conversation  half absent  half critical  which was inherited from her  father   all of them combined to intimidate the homely polly  and she  felt perhaps less at ease with her visitor as she saw more of her     presently they stood before some old photographs on polly s mantelpiece   polly looked timidly at her cousin      doan t yo think as hubert s verra handsome   she said     and taking up one of the portraits  she brushed it with her sleeve and  handed it to laura     laura held it up for scrutiny      no  o   she said coolly   not really handsome      polly looked disappointed      there s not a mony gells aboot here as doan t coe hubert handsome   she  said with emphasis      it s hubert s business to call the girls handsome   said laura   laughing  and handing back the picture     polly grinned  then suddenly looked grave      i wish he d leave t  gells alone   she said with an accent of some  energy   he ll mappen get into trooble yan o  these days       they don t keep him in his place  i suppose   said laura  flushing  she  hardly knew why  she got up and walked across the room to the window   what did she want to know about hubert and  t  gells   she hated vulgar  and lazy young men   though they might have a musical gift that  so to  speak  did not belong to them     nevertheless she turned round again to ask  with some imperiousness        where is your brother   what is he doing all this time       sittin alongside the coo  i dare say  lest daffady should be gettin the  credit of her   said polly  laughing   the poor creetur fell three days  sen  summat like a stroke  t  farrier said   an hubert s bin that jealous  o  daffady iver sen  he s actually poo ed hissel  oot o  bed mornins to  luke after her   lord bless us  i mun goa an feed t  calves      and hastily throwing an apron over her sunday gown  polly clattered down  the stairs in a whirlwind                                                 laura followed her more leisurely  passed through the empty kitchen and  opened the front door     as she stood under the porch looking out  she put up a small hand to hide  a yawn  when she set out that morning she had meant to spend the whole  day at the farm  now it was not yet tea time  and she was more than ready  to go  in truth her heart was hot  and rather bitter  cousin elizabeth   certainly  had treated her with a strange coolness  and as for  hubert  after that burst of friendship  beside the piano  she drew  herself together sharply  she would go at once and ask him for her pony  cart     lifting her skirt daintily  she picked her way across the dirty yard  and  fumbled at a door opposite  the door whence she had seen old daffady come  out at dinner time      who s there   shouted a threatening voice from within     laura succeeded in lifting the clumsy latch  hubert mason  from inside   saw a small golden head appear in the doorway      would you kindly help me get the pony cart   said the light   half sarcastic voice of miss fountain   i must be going  and polly s  feeding the calves      her eyes at first distinguished nothing but a row of dim animal forms  in  crowded stalls under a low roof  then she saw a cow lying on the ground   and hubert mason beside her  amid the wreaths of smoke that he was  puffing from a clay pipe  the place was dark  close  and fetid  she  withdrew her head hastily  there was a muttering and movement inside  and  mason came to the door  thrusting his pipe into his pocket      what do you want to go for  just yet   he said abruptly      i ought to get home       no  you don t care for us  nor our ways  that s it  an i don t wonder      she made polite protestations  but he would not listen to them  he strode  on beside her in a stormy silence  till the impulse to prick him  overmastered her      do you generally sit with the cows   she asked him sweetly  she shot her  grey eyes towards him  all mockery and cool examination  he was not  accustomed to such looks from the young women whom he chose to notice      i was not going to stay and be treated like that before strangers   he  said  with a sulky fierceness   mother thinks she and daffady can just  have their own way with me  as they d used to do when i was nobbut a lad   but i ll let her know  aye  and the men too       but if you hate farming  why don t you let daffady do the work      her sly voice stung him afresh      because i ll be measter   he said  bringing his hand violently down on  the shaft of the pony cart   if i m to stay on in this beastly hole i ll  make every one knaw their place  let mother give me some money  an i ll  soon take myself off  an leave her an daffady to draw their own water  their own way  but if i m here i m  measter    he struck the cart again      is it true you don t work nearly as hard as your father      he looked at her amazed  if susie flinders down at the mill had spoken to  him like that  he would have known how to shut her mouth for her      an i daur say it is   he said hotly   i m not goin to lead the dog s  life my father did  all for the sake of diddlin another sixpence or two  oot o  the neighbours  let mother give me my money oot o  the farm  i d  go to froswick fast enough  that s the place to get on  i ve got  friends  i d work up in no time      laura glanced at him  she said nothing      you doan t think i would   he asked her angrily  pausing in his handling  of the harness to throw back the challenge of her manner  his wrath  seemed to have made him handsomer  better braced  more alive  physically  she admired him for the first time  as he stood confronting her     but she only lifted her eyebrows a little      i thought one had to have a particular kind of brains for business  and  begin early  too       i could learn   he said gruffly  after which they were both silent till  the harnessing was done     then he looked up      i d like to drive you to the bridge  if you re agreeable       oh  don t trouble yourself  pray   she said in polite haste     his brows knit again      i know how  tis  you won t come here again      her little face changed      i d like to   she said  her voice wavering   because papa used to stay  here      he stared at her      i do remember cousin stephen   he said at last   though i towd you i  didn t  i can see him standing at the door there  wi  a big hat  an a  beard  like straw  an a check coat wi  great bulgin pockets      he stopped in amazement  seeing the sudden beauty of her eyes and cheeks      that s it   she said  leaning towards him   oh  that s it   she closed  her eyes a moment  her small lips trembling  then she opened them with a  long breath      yes  you may drive me to the bridge if you like                                                  and on the drive she was another being  she talked to him about music  so  softly and kindly that the young man s head swam with pleasure  all her  own musical enthusiasms and experiences  the music in the college  chapels  the music at the greek plays  the few london concerts and operas  she had heard  her teachers and her hero worships  she drew upon it all  in her round light voice  he joining in from time to time with a rough  passion and yearning that seemed to transfigure him  in half an hour  as  it were  they were friends  their relations changed wholly  he looked at  her with all his eyes  hung upon her with all his ears  and she  she  forgot that he was vulgar and a clown  such breathless pleasure  such a  humble absorption in superior wisdom  would have blunted the sternest  standard     as for him  the minutes flew  when at last the bridge over the bannisdale  river came in sight  he began to check the pony      let s drive on a bit   he said entreatingly      no  no  i must get back to mrs  fountain   and she took the reins from  his hands      i say  when will you come again       oh  i don t know   she had put on once more the stand off town bred  manner that puzzled his countryman s sense      i say  mother shan t talk that stuff to you next time  i ll tell her     he said imploringly    halloa  let me out  will you      and to her amazement  before she could draw in the pony  he had jumped  out of the cart      there s mr  helbeck   he said to her with a crimson face   i m off   good bye      he shook her hand hastily  turned his back  and strode away     she looked towards the gate in some bewilderment  and saw that helbeck  was holding it open for her  beside him stood a tall priest  not father  bowles  it was evident that both of them had seen her parting from her  cousin     well  what then  what was there in that  or in mr  helbeck s ceremonious  greeting  to make her cheeks hot all in a moment  she could have beaten  herself for a silly lack of self possession  still more could she have  beaten hubert for his clownish and hurried departure  what was he afraid  of  did he think that she would have shown the smallest shame of her  peasant relations           chapter vi     is that mrs  fountain s stepdaughter   said helbeck s companion  as  laura and her cart disappeared round a corner of the winding road on  which the two men were walking     helbeck made a sign of assent      you may very possibly have known her father   he named the cambridge  college of which stephen fountain had been a fellow     the jesuit  who was a convert  and had been a distinguished cambridge  man  considered for a moment      oh  yes  i remember the man  a strange being  who was only heard of  if  i recollect right  in times of war  if there was any dispute  going  especially on a religious point  stephen fountain would rush into  it with broad sheets  oh  yes  i remember him perfectly  a great untidy   fair haired  truculent fellow  to whom anybody that took any thought for  his soul was either fool or knave  how much of him does the daughter  inherit      helbeck returned the other s smile   a large slice  i think  she comes  here in the curious position of having never lived in a christian  household before  and she seems already to have great difficulty in  putting up with us      father leadham laughed  then looked reflective      how often have i known that the best of all possible beginnings  is she  attached to her stepmother       yes  but mrs  fountain has no influence over her       it is a striking colouring  that white skin and reddish hair  and it is  a face of some power  too       power   helbeck demurred   i think she is clever   he said dryly   and   of course  coming from a university town  she has heard of things that  other girls know nothing of  but she has had no training  moral or  intellectual       and no christian education      helbeck shrugged his shoulders      she was only baptized with difficulty  when she was eleven or twelve she  was allowed to go to church two or three times  i understand  on the  helot principle  was soon disgusted  her father of course supplying a  running comment at home  and she has stood absolutely outside religion of  all kinds since       poor child   said the priest with heartiness  the paternal note in the  words was more than official  he was a widower  and had lost his wife and  infant daughter two years before his entrance into the church of rome     helbeck smiled   i assure you miss fountain spends none of her pity upon  herself       i dare say more than you think  the position of the unbeliever in a  house like yours is always a painful one  you see she is alone  there  must be a sense of exile  of something touching and profound going on  beside her  from which she is excluded  she comes into a house with a  chapel  where the blessed sacrament is reserved  where everybody is  keeping a strict lent  she has not a single thought in common with you  all  no  i am very sorry for miss fountain      helbeck was silent a moment  his dark face showed a shade of disturbance      she has some relations near here   he said at last   but unfortunately i  can t do much to promote her seeing them  you remember williams s story       of course  you had some local row  didn t you  ah  i remember      and the two men walked on  discussing a case which had been and was still  of great interest to them as catholics  the hero  moreover  the jesuit  novice himself  was well known to them both      so miss fountain s relations belong to that peasant class   said the  jesuit  musing   how curious that she should find herself in such a  double relation to you and bannisdale       consider me a little  if you please   said helbeck  with his slight   rare smile   while that young lady is under my roof  you see how  attractive she is  i cannot get rid  you will admit  of a certain  responsibility  augustina has neither the will nor the authority of a  mother  and there is literally no one else  now there happens to be a  young man in this mason family          ah   said the priest   the young gentleman who jumped out at the bridge   with such a very light pair of heels      helbeck nodded   the old people were peasants and fanatics  they thought  ill of me in the williams affair  and the mother  who is still alive   would gladly hang and quarter me to morrow if she could  but that is  another point  the old people had their own dignity  their own manners  and virtues  or  rather  the manners and virtues of their class  the old  man was coarse and boorish  but he was hard working and honourable  and a  christian after his own sort  but the old man is dead  and the son  who  now works the farm jointly with his mother  is of no class and no  character  he has just education enough to despise his father and his  father s hard work  he talks the dialect with his inferiors  or his  kindred  and drops it with you and me  the old traditions have no hold  upon him  and he is just a vulgar and rather vicious hybrid  who drinks  more than is good for him and has a natural affinity for any sort of low  love affair  i came across him at our last hunt ball  i never go to such  things  but last year i went       good   ejaculated the jesuit  turning a friendly face upon the speaker     helbeck paused  the word  still more the emphasis with which it was  thrown out  challenged him  he was about to defend himself against an  implied charge  but thought better of it  and resumed      and unfortunately  considering the way in which all the clan felt  towards me already  i found this youth in the supper room  misbehaving  himself with a girl of his own sort  and very drunk  i fetched a steward   and he was told to go  after which  you may imagine that it is scarcely  agreeable to me to see my guest  a very young lady  very pretty  very  distinguished  driving about the country in cousinly relations with this  creature      the last words were spoken with considerable vivacity  the aristocrat and  the ascetic  the man of high family and the man of scrupulous and  fastidious character  were alike expressed in them     the jesuit pondered a little      no  you will have to keep watch  why not distract her  you must have  plenty of other neighbours to show her      helbeck shook his head      i live like a hermit  my sister is in the first year of her widowhood  and very delicate       i see   the jesuit hesitated  then said  smiling  in the tone of one who  makes a venture   the bishop and i allowed ourselves to discuss these  cloistered ways of yours the other day  we thought you would forgive us  as a pair of old friends       i know   was the somewhat quick interruption   the bishop is of  manning s temper in these things  he believes in acting on and with the  protestant world  in our claiming prominence as citizens  it was to  please him that i joined one or two committees last year  that i went to  the hunt ball         then  suddenly  in a very characteristic way  helbeck checked his own  flow of speech  and resumed more quietly   well  all that          leaves you of the same opinion still   said the jesuit  smiling      precisely  i don t belong to my neighbours  nor they to me  we don t  speak the same language  and i can t bring myself to speak theirs  the  old conditions are gone  i know  but my feeling remains pretty much  what  that of my forefathers was  i recognise that it is not common  nowadays  but i have the old maxim in my blood   extra ecclesiam nulla  salus        there is none which has done us more deadly harm in england   cried the  jesuit   we forget that england is a baptized nation  and is therefore in  the supernatural state       i remind myself of it very often   said helbeck  with a kind of proud  submission   and i judge no man  but my powers  my time  are all limited   i prefer to devote them to the  household of faith       the two men walked on in silence for a time  presently father leadham s  face showed amusement  and he said      certainly we modern converts have a better time of it than our  predecessors  the bishop tells me the most incredible things about the  old feeling towards them in this vicariate  and wherever i go i seem to  hear the tale of the old priest who thanked god that he had never  received anyone into the church  everybody has met someone who knew that  old fellow  he may be a myth  but there is clearly history at the back of  him       i understand him perfectly   said helbeck  smiling  and he added  immediately  with a curious intensity   i  too  have never influenced   never tried to influence  anyone in my life      the priest looked at him  wondering      not williams       williams  but williams was born for the faith  directly he saw what i  wanted to do in the chapel  he prayed to come and help me  it was his  summer holiday  he neglected no duty  it was wonderful to see his  happiness in the work  as i thought  an artistic happiness only  he used  to ask me questions about the different saints  once or twice he borrowed  a book  it was necessary to get the emblems correct  but i never said a  single controversial word to him  i never debated religious subjects with  him at all  till the night when he took refuge with me after his father  had thrashed him so cruelly that he could not stand  grace taught him   not i       grace taught him  but through you   said the priest with quiet emphasis    perhaps i know more about that than you do      helbeck flushed      i think you are mistaken  at any rate  i should prefer that you were  mistaken      the priest raised his eyebrows      a man who holds  no salvation outside the church    he said slowly   and  rejoices in the thought that he has never influenced anybody       i should hope little from the work achieved by such an instrument  some  men have enough to do with their own souls   was the low but vehement  answer     the priest threw a wondering glance at his companion  at the signs of  feeling  profound and morbid feeling  on the harsh face beside him      perhaps you have never cared enough for anyone outside to wish  passionately to bring them within   he said   but if that ever happens to  you  you will be ready  i think you will be ready  to use any tool  even  yourself      the priest s voice changed a little  helbeck  somewhat startled  recalled  the facts of father leadham s personal history  and thought he  understood  the subject was instantly dropped  and the two men walked on  to the house  discussing a great canonisation service at st  peter s and  the pope s personal part in it                                                 the old hall  as helbeck and father leadham approached it  looked down  upon a scene of animation to which in these latter days it was but little  accustomed  the green spaces and gravelled walks in front of it were  sprinkled with groups of children in a blue and white uniform  three or  four sisters of mercy in their winged white caps moved about among them   and some of the children hung clustered like bees about the sisters   skirts  while others ran here and there  gleefully picking the scattered  daffodils that starred the grass     the invaders came from the orphanage of st  ursula  a house founded by  mr  helbeck s exertions  which lay half way between bannisdale and  whinthorpe  they had not long arrived  and were now waiting for rosary  and benediction in the chapel before they were admitted to the tea which  mrs  denton and augustina had already spread for them in the big hall     at sight of the children helbeck s face lit up and his step quickened   they on their side ran to him from all parts  and he had hardly time to  greet the sisters in charge of them  before the eager creatures were  pulling him into the walled garden behind the hall  one small girl  hanging on his hand  another perched upon his shoulder  father leadham  went into the house to prepare for the service     the garden was old and dark  like the tudor house that stood between it  and the sun  rows of fantastic shapes carved in living yew and box stood  ranged along the straight walks  a bowling green enclosed in high beech  hedges was placed in the exact centre of the whole formal place  while  the walks and alleys from three sides  west  north  and south  converged  upon it  according to a plan unaltered since it was first laid down in  the days of james ii  at this time of the year there were no flowers in  the stiff flower beds  for mr  helbeck had long ceased to spend any but  the most necessary monies upon his garden  only upon the high stone walls  that begirt this strange and melancholy pleasure ground  and in the   wilderness  that lay on the eastern side  between the garden and the  fell  were nature and the spring allowed to show themselves  their joint  magic had covered the old walls with fruit blossom and spread the   wilderness  with daffodils  otherwise all was dark  tortured  fantastic   a monument of old world caprice that the heart could not love  though  piety might not destroy it     the children  however  brought life and brightness  they chased each  other up and down the paths  and in and out of the bowling green  helbeck  set them to games  and played with them himself  only for the orphans now  did he ever thus recall his youth     two sisters  one comparatively young  the other a woman of fifty  stood  in an opening of the bowling green  looking at the games     the younger one said to her companion  who was the superior of the  orphanage   i do like to see mr  helbeck with the children  it seems to  change him altogether      she spoke with eager sympathy  while her eyes  the visionary eyes of the  typical religious  sunk in a face that was at once sweet and peevish   followed the children and their host     the other  shrewd faced and large  had a movement of impatience      i should like to see mr  helbeck with some children of his own  for five  years now i have prayed our blessed mother to give him a good wife   that s what he wants  ah  mrs  fountain         and as augustina advanced with her little languid air  accompanied by her  stepdaughter  the sisters gathered round her  chattering and cooing   showing her a hundred attentions  enveloping her in a homage that was  partly addressed to the sister of their benefactor  and partly  as she  well understood  to the sheep that had been lost and was found  to the  stepdaughter they showed a courteous reserve  one or two of them had  already made acquaintance with her  and had not found her amiable     and  indeed  laura held herself aloof  as before  but she shot a glance  of curiosity at the elderly woman who had wished mr  helbeck a good wife   the girl had caught the remark as she and her stepmother turned the  corner of the dense beechen hedge that  with openings to each point of  the compass  enclosed the bowling green     presently helbeck  stopping to take breath in a game of which he had been  the life  caught sight of the slim figure against the red brown of the  hedge  the next moment he perceived that miss fountain was watching him  with an expression of astonishment     his first instinct was to let her be  her manner towards him since her  arrival  with hardly a break  had been such as to chill the most sociable  temper  and helbeck s temper was far from sociable     but something in her attitude  perhaps its solitariness  made him  uncomfortable  he went up to her  dragging with him a crowd of small  children  who tugged at his coat and hands      miss fountain  will you take pity on us  my breath is gone      he saw her hesitate  then her sudden smile broke out      what ll you have   she said  catching hold of the nearest child   mother  bunch      and off she flew  running  twisting  turning with the merriest of them   her loosened hair gleaming in the sun  her small feet twinkling  now it  was helbeck s turn to stand and watch  what a curious grace and purpose  there was in all her movements  even in her play miss fountain was a  personality     at last a little girl who was running with her began to drag and turn  pale  laura stopped to look at her      i can t run any more   said the child piteously   i had a bone took out  of my leg last year      she was a sickly looking creature  rickety and consumptive  a waif from a  liverpool slum  laura picked her up and carried her to a seat in a yew  arbour away from the games  then the child studied her with shy looking  eyes  and suddenly slipped an arm like a bit of stick round the pretty  lady s neck      tell me a story  please  teacher   she said imploringly     laura was taken aback  for she had forgotten the tales of her own  childhood  and had never possessed any younger brothers or sisters  or  paid much attention to children in general  but with some difficulty she  stumbled through cinderella      oh  yes  i know that  but it s lovely   said the child  at the end  with  a sigh of content   now i ll tell you one      and in a high nasal voice  like one repeating a lesson in class  she  began upon something which laura soon discovered to be the life of a  saint  she followed the phrases of it with a growing repugnance  till at  last the speaker said  with the unction of one sure of her audience      and once the good father went to a hospital to visit some sick people   and as he was hearing a poor sailor s confession  he found out that it  was his own brother  whom he had not seen for a long  long time  now the  sailor was very ill  and going to die  and he had been a bad man  and  done a great many wicked things  but the good father did not let the poor  man know who he was  he went home and told his superior that he had found  his brother  and the superior forbade him to go and see his brother  again  because  he said  god would take care of him  and the father was  very sad  and the devil tempted him sorely  but he prayed to god  and god  helped him to be obedient      and a great many years afterwards a poor woman came to see the good  father  and she told him she had seen our blessed lady in a vision  and  our blessed lady had sent her to tell the father that because he had been  so obedient  and had not been to see his brother again  our lady had  prayed our lord for his brother  and his brother had made a good death   and was saved  all because the good father had obeyed what his superior  told him      laura sprang up  the child  who had expected a kiss and a pious phrase   looked up  startled      wasn t that a pretty story   she said timidly      no  i don t like it at all   said miss fountain decidedly   i wonder  they tell you such tales      the child stared at her for a moment  then a sudden veil fell across the  clearness of her eyes  which had the preternatural size and brilliance of  disease  her expression changed  it became the slyness of the watching  animal  that feels the enemy  she said not another word     laura felt a pang of shame  even though she was still vibrating with the  repulsion the child s story had excited in her      look   she said  raising the little one in her arms   the others are all  going into the house  shall we go too      but the child struggled resolutely      let me down  i can walk   laura set her down  and the child walked as  fast as her lame leg would let her to join the others  once or twice she  looked round furtively at her companion  but she would not take the hand  laura offered her  and she seemed to have wholly lost her tongue      little bigot   thought laura  half angry  half amused   do they catch it  from their cradle      presently they found themselves in the tail of a crowd of children and  sisters who were ascending the stairs of a doorway opening on the garden   the doorway led  as laura knew  to the corridor of the chapel  she let  herself be carried along  irresolute  and presently she found herself  within the curtained doorway  mechanically helping the sisters and  augustina to put the children in their places     one or two of the older children noticed that the young lady with mrs   fountain did not sign herself with holy water  and did not genuflect in  passing the altar  and they looked at her with a stealthy surprise  a  gentle looking young sister came up to her as she was lifting a very  small child to a seat      thank you   murmured the sister   it is very good of you   but the  voice  though so soft  was cold  and laura at once felt herself the  intruder  and withdrew to the back of the crowd     yet again  as at her first visit to the chapel  so now  she was too  curious  for all her soreness  to go  she must see what they would be at                                                  rosary  passed  and she hardly understood a word  the voice of the  jesuit intoning suggested nothing intelligible to her  and it was some  time before she could even make out what the children were saying in  their loud voiced responses   holy mary  mother of god  pray for us  sinners  now and at the hour of our death   was that it  and occasionally  an  our father  thrown in  all of it gabbled as fast as possible  as  though the one object of both priest and people were to get through and  make an end  over and over again  without an inflection  or a  change  with just the one monotonous repetition and the equally  monotonous variation  what a barbarous and foolish business     very soon she gave up listening  her eyes wandered to the frescoes  to  the bare altar with its purple covering  to the tall candles sparkling  before the tabernacle  and the coloured and scented gloom  pierced with  the distant lights  gave her a vague pleasure     presently there was a pause  the children settled themselves in their  seats with a little clatter  father leadham retired  while the sisters  knelt  each bowed profoundly on herself  eyes closed under her coif   hands clasped in front of her     what were they waiting for  ah  there was the priest again  but in a  changed dress  a white cope of some splendour  the organ  played by one  of the sisters  broke out upon the silence  and the voices of the rest  rose suddenly  small and sweet  in a latin hymn  the priest went to the  tabernacle  and set it open  there was a swinging of incense  and the  waves of fragrant smoke flowed out upon the chapel  dimming the altar and  the figure before it  laura caught sight for a moment of the young sister  who had spoken to her  she was kneeling and singing  with sweet  shut  eyes  it was clear that she was possessed by a fervour of feeling  miss  fountain thought to herself  with wonder   she cannot be much older than  i am      after the hymn it was the children s turn  what were they singing so  lustily to so dancing a tune  laura bent over to look at the book of a  sister in front of her      virgo prudentissima  virgo veneranda  virgo praedicanda         with difficulty she found the place in another book that lay upon a chair  beside her  then for a few minutes she lost herself in a first amazement  over that string of epithets and adjectives with which the catholic  church throughout the world celebrates day by day and sunday after sunday  the glories of mary  the gay music  the harsh and eager voices of the  children  flowed on  the waves of incense spread throughout the chapel   when she raised her eyes they fell upon helbeck s dark head in the far  distance  above his server s cotta  a quick change crossed her face   transforming it to a passionate contempt                                                 but of her no one thought  save once  the beautiful  moment  of the  ceremony had come  father leadham had raised the monstrance  containing  the host  to give the benediction  every sister  every child  except a  few small and tired ones  was bowed in humblest adoration     mr  helbeck  too  was kneeling in the little choir  but his attention  wandered  with the exception of his walk with father leadham  he had been  in church since early morning  and even for him response was temporarily  exhausted  his look strayed over the chapel     it was suddenly arrested  above the kneeling congregation a distant face  showed plainly in the april dusk amid the dimness of incense and  painting  a girl s face  delicately white and set  a face of revolt      why is she here   was his first thought  it came with a rush of  annoyance  even resentment  but immediately other thoughts met it   she  is lonely  she is here under my roof  she has lost her father  poor  child      the last mental phrase was not so much his own as an echo from father  leadham  in helbeck s mind it was spoken very much as the priest had  spoken it  with that strange tenderness  at once so intimate and so  impersonal  which belongs to the spiritual relations of catholicism  the  girl s soul  lonely  hostile  uncared for  appealed to the charity of the  believer  at the same time there was something in her defiance  her crude  disapproval of his house and his faith  that stimulated and challenged  the man  conscious for the first time of a new conflict of feeling within  himself  he looked steadily towards her across the darkness     it was as though he had sought and found a way to lift himself above her  young pride  her ignorant enmity  for a moment there was a curious  exaltation and tyranny in his thought  he dropped his head and prayed for  her  the words falling slow and deliberate within his consciousness  and  she could not resent it or stop it  it was an aggression before which she  was helpless  it struck down the protest of her pale look                                                 at supper  when the sisters and their charges had departed  father bowles  appeared  and never before had helbeck been so lamentably aware of the  absurdities and inferiorities of his parish priest     the jesuit  too  was sharply conscious of them  and even augustina felt  that something was amiss  was it that they were all  except father  bowles  affected by the presence of the young lady on helbeck s right  by  the cool detachment of her manner  the self possession that appealed to  no one and claimed none of the prerogatives of sex and charm  while every  now and then it made itself felt in tacit and resolute opposition to her  environment      he might leave those things alone   thought the jesuit angrily  as he  heard father bowles giving mrs  fountain a gently complacent account of a  geological lecture lately delivered in whinthorpe      what i always say  you know  my dear lady  is this  you must show me the  evidence  after all  you geologists have done much  you have dug here and  there  it is true  but dig all over the world  dig everywhere  lay it all  bare  then you may ask me to listen to you      the little round faced priest looked round the table for support  laura  bit her lip and bent over her plate  father leadham turned hastily to  helbeck  and began to discuss with him a recent monograph on the roman  wall  showing a plentiful and scholarly knowledge of the subject  and  presently he drew in the girl opposite  addressing her with a  man of the world ease and urbanity which disarmed her  it appeared that  he had just come back from mission work in british guiana  that he had  been in india  and was in all respects a travelled and accomplished  person  but the girl did not yield herself  though she listened quite  civilly and attentively while he talked     but again through the jesuit s easy or polished phrases there broke the  purring inanity of father bowles      lourdes  my dear lady  lourdes  how can there be the smallest doubt of  the miracles of lourdes  why  they keep two doctors on the spot to verify  everything      the jesuit s sense of humour was uncomfortably touched  he glanced at  miss fountain  but could only see that she was gazing steadily out of  window     as for himself  convert and ex fellow of a well known college  he gave a  strong inward assent to the judgment of some of his own leaders  that the  older catholic priests of this country are as a rule lamentably unfit for  their work   our chance in england is broadening every year   he said to  himself   how are we to seize it with such tools  but all round we want   men   oh  for a few more of those who were  out in forty five                                                   in the drawing room after dinner laura  as usual  entrenched herself in  one of the deep oriel windows  behind a heavy table  augustina showed an  anxious curiosity as to the expedition of the morning  as to the masons  and their farm  but laura would say very little about them     when the gentlemen came in  helbeck sent a searching look round the  drawing room  he had the air of one who enters with a purpose     the beautiful old room lay in a half light  a lamp at either end could do  but little against the shadows that seemed to radiate from the panelled  walls and from the deep red hangings of the windows  but the wood fire on  the hearth sent out a soft glow  which fastened on the few points of  brilliance in the darkness  on the ivory of the fretted ceiling  on the  dazzling dress of the romney  on the gold of miss fountain s hair     laura looked up with some surprise as helbeck approached her  then   seeing that he apparently wished to talk  she made a place for him among  the old  books of beauty  with which she had been bestrewing the seat  that ran round the window      i trust the pony behaved himself this morning   he said  as he sat down     laura answered politely      and you found your way without difficulty       oh  yes  your directions were exact      inwardly she said to herself   does he want to cross examine me about the  masons   then  suddenly  she noticed the scar under his hair  a jagged  mark  testifying to a wound of some severity  and it made her  uncomfortable  nay  it seemed in some curious way to put her in the  wrong  to shake her self reliance     but helbeck had not come with the intention of talking about the masons   his avoidance of their name was indeed a pointed one  he drew out her  admiration of the daffodils and of the view from browhead lane      after easter we must show you something of the high mountains  augustina  tells me you admire the country  the head of windermere will delight  you      his manner of offering her these civilities was somewhat stiff and  conventional  the manner of one who had been brought up among country  gentry of the old school  apart from london and the  beau monde   but it  struck laura that  for the first time  he was speaking to her as a man of  his breeding might be expected to speak to a lady visiting his house   there was consideration  and an apparent desire to please  it was as  though she had grown all at once into something more in his eyes than  mrs  fountain s little stepdaughter  who was  no doubt  useful as a nurse  and a companion  but radically unwelcome and insignificant none the less     inevitably the girl s vanity was smoothed  she began to answer more  naturally  her smile became more frequent  and gradually an unwonted ease  and enjoyment stole over helbeck also  he talked with so much animation  at last as to draw the attention of another person in the room  father  leadham  who had been leaning with some languor against the high  carved  mantel  while father bowles and augustina babbled beneath him  began to  take increasing notice of miss fountain  and of her relation to the  bannisdale household  for a girl who had  no training  moral or  intellectual   she was showing herself  he thought  possessed of more  attraction than might have been expected  for the strict master of the  house     presently helbeck came to a pause in what he was saying  he had been  describing the country of wordsworth  and had been dwelling on grasmere  and eydal mount  in the tone  indeed  of one who had no vital concern  whatever with the lake poets or their poetry  but still with an evident  desire to interest his companion  and following closely on this first  effort to make friends with her something further suggested itself     he hesitated  looked at laura  and at last said  in a lower voice than he  had been using   i believe your father  miss fountain  was a great lover  of wordsworth  augustina has told me so  you and he were accustomed  were  you not  to read much together  your loss must be very great  you will  not wonder  perhaps  that for me there are painful thoughts connected  with your father  but i have not been insensible  i have not been without  feeling  for my sister  and for you      he spoke with embarrassment  and a kind of appeal  laura had been  startled by his first words  and while he spoke she sat very pale and  upright  staring at him  the hand on her lap shook     when he ceased she did not answer  she turned her head  and he saw her  pretty throat tremble  then she hastily raised her handkerchief  a  struggle passed over the face  she wiped away her tears  and threw back  her head  with a sobbing breath and a little shake of the bright hair   like one who reproves herself  but she said nothing  and it was evident  that she could say nothing without breaking down     deeply touched  helbeck unconsciously drew a little nearer to her   changing the subject at once  he began to talk to her of the children and  the little festival of the afternoon  an hour before he would have  instinctively avoided doing anything of the kind  now  at last  he  ventured to be himself  or something near it  laura regained her  composure  and bent her attention upon him  with a slightly frowning  brow  her mind was divided between the most contradictory impulses and  attractions  how had it come about  she asked herself  after a while   that  she  was listening like this to his schemes for his children and  his new orphanage   she  and not his natural audience  the two priests  and augustina     she actually heard him describe the efforts made by himself and one or  two other catholics in the county to provide shelter and education for  the county s catholic orphans  he dwelt on the death and disappearance of  some of his earlier colleagues  on the urgent need for a new building in  the neighbourhood of the county town  and for the enlargement of the   home  he himself had put up some ten years before  on the whinthorpe  road      but  unfortunately  large plans want large means   he added  with a  smile   and i fear it will come to it  has augustina said anything to you  about it   i fear there is nothing for it  but that our beauteous lady  there must provide them      he nodded towards the picture that gleamed from the opposite wall  then  he added gravely  and with a perfect simplicity      it is my last possession of any value      several times during the fortnight that she had known him  laura had  heard him speak with a similar simplicity about his personal and  pecuniary affairs  that anyone so stately should treat himself and his  own worldly concerns with so much  naivete  had been a source of frequent  surprise to her  to what  then  did his dignity  his reserve apply     nevertheless  because  childishly  she had already taken a side  as it  were  about the picture  his manner  with its apparent indifference   annoyed her  she drew back      yes  augustina told me  but isn t it cruel  isn t it unkind  a picture  like that is alive  it has been here so long  one could hardly feel it  belonged only to oneself  it is part of the house  isn t it   part of the  family  won t other people  people who come after  reproach you      helbeck lifted his shoulders  his dark face half amused  half sad      she died a hundred years ago  pretty creature  she has had her turn  so  have we  in the pleasure of looking at her       but she belongs to you   said the girl insistently   she is your own  kith and kin      he hesitated  then said  with a new emphasis that answered her own      perhaps there are two sorts of kindred         the girl s cheek flushed      and the one you mean may always push out the other  i know  because one  of your children told me a story to day  such a frightful story   of a  saint who would not go to see his dying brother  for obedience  sake  she  asked me if i liked it  how could i say i liked it  i told her it was  horrible  i wondered how people could tell her such tales      her bearing was again all hostility  a young defiance  she was delighted  to confess herself  her crime  untold  had been pressing upon her  conscience  hurting her natural frankness     helbeck s face changed  he looked at her attentively  the fine dark eye   under the commanding brow  straight and sparkling      you said that to the child       yes      her breast fluttered  she trembled  he saw  with an excitement she could  hardly repress     he  too  felt a novel excitement  the excitement of a strong will  provoked  it was clear to him that she meant to provoke him  that her  young personality threw itself wantonly across his own  he spoke with a  harsh directness      you did wrong  i think  quite wrong  excuse the word  but you have  brought me to close quarters  you sowed the seeds of doubt  of revolt  in  a child s mind       perhaps   said laura quickly   what then      she wore her half wild  half mocking look  everything soft and touching  had disappeared  the eyes shone under the golden mass of hair  the small  mouth was close and scornful  helbeck looked at her in amazement  his own  pulse hurrying      what then   he echoed  with a sternness that astonished himself   ask  your own feeling  what has a child  a little child under orders  to do  with doubt  or revolt  for her  for all of us  doubt is misery      laura rose  she forced down her agitation  made herself speak plainly      papa taught me  it was life  and i believe him      the old clock in the farther corner of the room struck a quarter to  ten  the hour of prayers  the two priests on the farther side of the room  stood up  and augustina sheathed her knitting needles     laura turned towards helbeck and coldly held out her little hand  he  touched it  and she crossed the room   good night  augustina      she kissed her stepmother  and bowed to the two priests  father leadham  ceremoniously opened the door for her  then he and helbeck  father bowles  and augustina followed across the dark hall on their way to the chapel   laura took her candle  and her light figure could be seen ascending the  jacobean staircase  a slim and charming vision against the shadows of the  old house     father leadham followed it with eyes and thoughts  then he glanced  towards helbeck  an idea  and one that was singularly unwelcome  was  forcing its way into the priest s mind           book ii          chapter i    from that night onwards the relations between helbeck and his sister s  stepdaughter took another tone  he no longer went his own way  with no  more than a vague consciousness that a curious and difficult girl was in  the house  he watched her with increasing interest  he began to taste  as  it were  the thorny charm that was her peculiar possession     not that he was allowed to see much of the charm  after the conversation  of passion sunday her manner to him was no less cold and distant than  before  their final collision  on the subject of the child  had  he  supposed  undone the effects of his conciliatory words about her father   it must be so  no doubt  since her hostile observation of him and of his  friends seemed to be in no whit softened     that he should be so often conscious of her at this particular time  annoyed and troubled him  it was the most sacred moment of the catholic  year  father leadham  his old stonyhurst friend  had come to spend  passion week and holy week at bannisdale  as a special favour to one whom  the church justly numbered among the most faithful of her sons  while the  society of jesus had many links of mutual service and affection  both  with the helbeck family in the past and with the present owner of the  hall  helbeck  indeed  was of real importance to catholicism in this  particular district of england  it had once abounded in catholic  families  but now hardly one of them remained  and upon helbeck  with his  small resources and dwindling estate  devolved a number of labours which  should have been portioned out among a large circle  only enthusiasm such  as his could have sufficed for the task  but  for the church s sake  he  had now remained unmarried some fifteen years  he lived like an ascetic  in the great house  with a couple of women servants  he spent all his  income  except a fraction  on the good works of a wide district  when  larger sums were necessary he was ready  nay  eager  to sell the land  necessary to provide them  and whenever he journeyed to other parts of  england  or to the continent  it was generally assumed that he had gone   not as other men go  for pleasure and recreation  but simply that he  might pursue some catholic end  either of money or administration  among  the rich and powerful of the faith elsewhere  meanwhile  it was believed  that he had bequeathed the house and park of bannisdale to a distant  cousin  also a strict catholic  with the warning that not much else would  remain to his heir from the ancient and splendid inheritance of the  family     it was not wonderful  then  that the jesuits should be glad to do such a  man a service  and no service could have been greater in helbeck s eyes  than a visit from a priest of their order during these weeks of emotion  and of penance  every day mass was said in the little chapel  every  evening a small flock gathered to litany or benediction  ordinary life  went on as it could in the intervals of prayer and meditation  the house  swarmed with priests  with old and infirm priests  many of them from a  jesuit house of retreat on the western coast  not far away  who found in  a visit to bannisdale one of the chief pleasures of their suffering or  monotonous lives  while the superiors of helbeck s own orphanages were  always ready to help the bannisdale chapel  on days of special sanctity   by sending a party of sisters and children to provide the singing     meanwhile all else was forgotten  as to food  helbeck and father  leadham  according to the letters describing her experiences which laura  wrote during these weeks to a cambridge girl friend  lived upon  a cup of  coffee and a banana  per day  and she had endless difficulty in  restraining her charge  augustina  from doing likewise  for augustina   indeed  stephen fountain s little black robed widow  her husband was  daily receding further and further into a dim and dreadful distance   where she feared and yet wept to think of him  she passed her time in the  intoxication of her recovered faith  excited by the people around her  by  the services in the chapel  and by her very terrors over her own unholy  union  lapse  and restoration  the sound of intoning  the scent  of  incense  seemed to pervade the house  and at the centre of all brooded  that mysterious presence upon the altar  which drew the passion of  catholic hearts to itself in ever deeper measure as the great days of  holy week and easter approached     through all this drama of an inventive and exacting faith  laura fountain  passed like a being from another world  an alien and a mocking spirit   she said nothing  but her eyes were satires  the effect of her presence  in the house was felt probably by all its inmates  and by many of its  visitors  she did not again express herself  except rarely to  augustina  with the vehemence she had shown to the little lame orphan   she was quite ready to chat and laugh upon occasion with father leadham   who had a pleasant wit  and now and then deliberately sought her society   and  owing to the feebleness of augustina  she  quite unconsciously   established certain household ways which spoke the woman  and were new to  bannisdale  she filled the drawing room with daffodils  she made the  tea table by the hall fire a cheerful place for any who might visit it   she flitted about the house in the prettiest and neatest of spring  dresses  her hair  her face  her white hands and neck shone amid the  shadows of the panelling like jewels in a casket  everyone was conscious  of her  uneasily conscious  she yielded herself to no one  was touched by  no one  she stood apart  and through her cold  light ways spoke the world  and the spirit that deny  the world at which the catholic shudders     at the same time  like everybody else in the house  even the sulky  housekeeper  she grew pale and thin from lenten fare  mr  helbeck had of  course given orders to mrs  denton that his sister and miss fountain were  to be well provided  but mrs  denton was grudging or forgetful  and it  amused laura to see that augustina was made to eat  while she herself  fared with the rest  the viands of whatever sort were generally scanty  and ill cooked  and neither the squire nor father leadham cared anything  about the pleasures of the table  in lent or out of it  mr  helbeck  hardly noticed what was set before him  once or twice indeed he woke up  to the fact that there was not enough for the ladies and would say an  angry word to mrs  denton  but on the whole laura was able to follow her  whim and to try for herself what this catholic austerity might be like      my dear   she wrote to her friend   one thing you learn from a catholic  lent is that food matters  nowt at aw   as they would say in these parts   you can do just as well without it as with it  why you should think  yourself a saint for not eating it puzzles me  otherwise   vive la faim    and as we are none of us likely to starve ourselves half so much as the  poor people of the world  the soldiers  and sailors  and explorers  are  always doing  to please themselves or their country  i don t suppose that  anybody will come to harm      you are to understand  nevertheless  that our austerities are rather  unusual  and when anyone comes in from the outside they are concealed as  much as possible     the old helbecks  as far as i can hear  must have  been very different people from their modern descendant  they were quite  good catholics  understand  what the church prescribed they did  but not  a fraction beyond  they were like the jolly lazy sort of schoolboy  who   just  does his lesson  but would think himself a fool if he did a word  more  whereas the man who lives here now can never do enough      and in general these old catholic houses  from augustina s tales  must  have been full of fun and feasting  well  i can vouch for it  there is no  fun in bannisdale now  it is mr  helbeck s personality  i suppose  it  makes its own atmosphere  he  can  laugh  i have seen it myself   but it  is an event                                                  as lent went on  the mingling of curiosity and cool criticism with which  miss fountain regarded her surroundings became perhaps more apparent   father leadham  in particular  detected the young lady s fasting  experiments  he spoke of them to helbeck as showing a lack of delicacy  and good taste  but the squire  it seemed  was rather inclined to regard  them as the whims of a spoilt and wilful child     this difference of shade in the judgment of the two men may rank as one  of the first signs of all that was to come     certainly helbeck had never before felt himself so uncomfortable in his  own house as he had done since the arrival of this girl of twenty one   nevertheless  as the weeks went on  the half amused  half contemptuous  embarrassment  which had been the first natural effect of her presence  upon the mind of a man so little used to women and their ways  had passed  imperceptibly into something else  his reserved and formal manner  remained the same  but miss fountain s goings and comings had ceased to  be indifferent to him  a silent relation  still unknown to her  had  arisen between them     when he first noticed the fact in himself  it produced a strong   temporary reaction  he reproached himself for a light and unworthy  temper  had his solitary life so weakened him that any new face and  personality about him could distract and disturb him  even amid the great  thoughts of these solemn days  his heart  his life were in his faith  for  more than twenty years  by prayer and meditation  by all the ingenious  means that the catholic church provides  he had developed the  sensibilities of faith  and for the catholic these sensibilities are  centred upon and sustained by the passion  now  hour by hour  his lord  was moving to the cross  he stood perpetually beside the sacred form in  the streets of jerusalem  in gethsemane  on the steps of the praetorium   a varied and dramatic ceremonial was always at hand to stimulate the  imagination  the penitence  and the devotion of the believer  that  anything whatever should break in upon the sacred absorption of these  days would have seemed to him beforehand a calamity to be shrunk  from  nay  a sin to be repented  he had put aside all business that could  be put aside with one object  and one only  to make  a good easter      and yet  no sooner did he come back from service in the chapel  or from  talk of church matters with catholic friends  than he found himself  suddenly full of expectation  was miss fountain in the hall  in the  garden  or was she gone to those people at browhead  if she was not in  the house  above all  if she was with the masons  he would find it hard  to absorb himself again in the thoughts that had held him before  if she  was there  if he found her sitting reading or working by the hall fire   with the dogs at her feet  he seldom indeed went to speak to her  he  would go into his library  and force himself to do his business  while  father leadham talked to her and augustina  but the library opened on the  hall  and he could still hear that voice in the distance  often  when she  caressed the dogs  her tones had the note in them which had startled him  on her very first evening under his roof  it was the emergence of  something hidden and passionate  and it awoke in himself a strange and  troubling echo  the passing surge of an old memory long since thrust down  and buried  how fast his youth was going from him  it was fifteen years  since a woman s voice  a woman s presence  had mattered anything at all  to him     so it came about that  in some way or other  he knew  broadly  all that  miss fountain did  little as he saw of her  it appeared that she had  discovered a pony carriage for hire in the little village near the  bridge  and once or twice during this fortnight  he learned from  augustina that she had spent the afternoon at browhead farm  while the  bannisdale household had been absorbed in some function of the season     augustina disliked the news as much as he did  and would throw up her  hands in annoyance      what  can  she be doing there  they seem the roughest kind of people   but she says the son plays so wonderfully  i believe she plays duets with  him  she goes out with the cart full of music       music   said helbeck  in frank amazement   that lout       well  she says so   said augustina crossly  as though it were a personal  affront   and what do you think  alan  she talks of going to a dance up  there after easter  next thursday  i think       at the farm   helbeck s tone was incredulous      no  at the mill  or somewhere  she says the schoolmaster is giving it   or something of that sort  of course it s most unsuitable  but what am i  to do  alan  they  are  her relations       at the same time they are not her class   said helbeck decidedly   she  has been brought up in a different way  and she cannot behave as though  she belonged to them  and a dance  with that young man to look after her   you ought to stop it      augustina said dismally that she would try  but her head shook with more  feebleness than usual as she went back to her knitting                                                 next day helbeck made a point of finding his sister alone  but she only  threw him a deprecatory look      i tried  alan  indeed i did  she says that she wants some  amusement  that it will do her good  and that of course her father would  have let her go to a dance with his relations  and when i say anything to  her about not being quite like them  she fires up  she says she would be  ashamed to be thought any better than they  and that hubert has a great  deal more good in him than some people think       hubert   exclaimed mr  helbeck  raising his shoulders in disgust  after  a little silence he turned round as he was leaving the room  and said  abruptly   is she to stay the night at the farm       no  oh  no  she wants to come home  she says she won t be late  she  promises not to be late       and that young fellow will drive her home  of course       well  she couldn t drive home alone  alan  at that time of night  it  wouldn t be proper      mr  helbeck smiled rather sourly   one may doubt where the propriety  comes in  well  she seems determined  we must just arrange it  there is  the tower door  kindly tell her  augustina  that i will let her have the  key of it  and kindly tell her also  as from yourself  of course  that  she will be treating us all with courtesy if she does come home at a  reasonable hour  we have been a very quiet  prim household all these  years  and mrs  denton  for all her virtues  has a tongue       so she has   said augustina  sighing   and she doesn t like laura  not  at all      helbeck raised his head quickly   she does nothing to make miss fountain  uncomfortable  i trust       oh  no   said augustina undecidedly   besides  it doesn t matter  laura  has got ellen under her thumb      helbeck s grave countenance showed a gleam of amusement      how does mrs  denton take that       oh  she has to bear it  haven t you seen  alan  how the girl has  brightened up  laura has shown her how to do her hair  she helped her to  make a new frock for easter  the girl would do anything in the world for  her  it s like bruno  do you notice  alan  i really thought you would be  angry  that the dog will hardly go with you when laura s there       oh  miss fountain is a very attractive young lady  to those she likes    said helbeck dryly     and on that he went away     on good friday afternoon laura  in a renewed passion of revolt against  all that was going on in the house  went to her room and wrote to her  friend  litanies were being said in the chapel  the distant  melancholy  sounds mounted to her now and then  otherwise the house was wrapped in a  mourning silence  and outside  trailing clouds hung round the old walls   making a penitential barrier all about it      after this week   wrote laura to her friend   i shall always feel kindly  towards  sin   and the  world   how they have been scouted and scourged   and what  i ask you  would any of us do without them  the  world    indeed  i seem to hear it go rumbling on  the poor  patient  toiling  thing  while these people are praying  it works  and makes it possible  for them to pray  while they abuse and revile it      and as to  sin   and the gloom in which we all live because of it  what  on earth does it really mean to any decently taught and brought up  creature  you are greedy  or selfish  or idle  or ill behaved  very well   then  nature  or your next door neighbor  knocks you down for it  and  serve you right  next time you won t do it again  or not so badly  and by  degrees you don t even like to think of doing it  you would be  ashamed    as people say  it s the process that everybody has to go through  i  suppose  being sent into the world the sort of beings we are  and without  any leave of ours  altogether  but why make such a wailing and woe and  hullabaloo about it  oh  such a waste of time  why doesn t mr  helbeck go  and learn geology  i vow he hasn t an idea what the rocks of his own  valley are made of      of course there are the  very  great villains  i don t like to think  about them  and the people who are born wrong and sick  but by and by we  shall have weeded them out  or improved the breed  and why not spend your  energies on doing that  instead of singing litanies  and taking  ridiculous pains not to eat the things you like         i shall soon be in disgrace with augustina and mr  helbeck  about the  masons  worse disgrace  that is to say  for now that i have found a pony  of my own  i go up there two or three times a week  and really  in spite  of all those first experiences i told you of  i like it  cousin elizabeth  has begun to talk to me  and when i come home  i read the bible to see  what it was all about  and i don t let her say too bad things about mr   helbeck  it wouldn t be quite gentlemanly on my part  and i know most of  the williams story now  both from her and augustina      imagine  my dear   a son not allowed to come and see his mother before  she died  though she cried for him night and day  he was at a jesuit  school in wales  they shilly shallied  and wrote endless letters  and at  last they sent him off  the day she died  he arrived three hours too  late  and his father shut the door in his face   noa yo  shan t see her    said the grim old fellow   an if there s a god above  yo  shan t see her  in heaven nayder   augustina of course calls it  holy obedience       the painting in the chapel is really extraordinary  mr  helbeck seems to  have taught the young man  to begin with  he himself used to paint long  ago  not very well  i should think  to judge from the bits of his work  still left in the chapel  but at any rate the youth learnt the rudiments  from him  and then of course went far beyond his teacher  he was almost  two years here  working in the house  tabooed by his family all the time   then there seems to have been a year in london  when he gave mr  helbeck  some trouble  i don t know  augustina is vague  how it was that he joined  the jesuits i can t make out  no doubt mr  helbeck induced them to take  him  but  why   i ask you  with such a gift  they say he will be here in  the summer  and one will have to set one s teeth and shake hands with  him      oh  that droning in the chapel  there it is again  i will open the  window and let the howl of the rain in to get rid of it  and yet i can t  always keep myself away from it  it is all so new  so horribly intimate   every now and then the music or a prayer or something sends a stab right  down to my heart of hearts   a voice of suffering  of torture  oh  so  ghastly  so  real   then i come and read papa s note books for an hour to  forget it  i wish he had ever taught me anything  strictly  but  of  course  it was my fault          as to this dance  why shouldn t i go   just tell me  it is being  given by the new schoolmaster  and two or three young farmers  in the big  room at the old mill  the schoolmaster is the most tiresomely virtuous  young man  and the whole thing is so respectable  it makes me yawn to  think of it  polly implores me to go  and i like polly   very soon she ll  let me halve her fringe   i gave hubert a preliminary snub  and now he  doesn t dare implore me to go  but that is all the more engaging  i   don t  flirt with him   heavens   unless you call bear taming  flirtation  but one can t see his music running to waste in such a bog of  tantrums and tempers  i must try my hand  and as he is my cousin i can  put up with him                                                  after high mass on easter sunday helbeck walked home from whinthorpe  alone  as his companion father leadham had an engagement in the town     through the greater part of holy week the skies had been as grey and  penitential as the season  the fells and the river flats had been  scourged at night with torrents of rain and wind  and in the pale  mornings any passing promise of sun had been drowned again before the day  was high  the roofs and eaves  the small panes of the old house  trickled  and shone with rain  and at night the wind tore through the gorge of the  river with great boomings and onslaughts from the west  but with easter  eve there had come appeasement  a quiet dying of the long storm  and as  helbeck made his way along the river on easter morning  mountain and  flood  grass and tree  were in a glory of recovered sun  the distant  fells were drawn upon the sky in the heavenliest brushings of blue and  purple  the river thundered over its falls and weirs in a foamy  splendour  and the deer were feeding with a new zest amid the  fast greening grass     he stopped a moment to rest upon his stick and look about him  something  in his own movement reminded him of another solitary walk some five weeks  before  and at the same instant he perceived a small figure sitting on a  stone seat in front of him  it was miss fountain  she had a book on her  knee  and the two dogs were beside her  her white dress and hat seemed to  make the centre of a whole landscape  the river bent inward in a great  sweep at her feet  the crag rose behind her  and the great prospect  beyond the river of dale and wood  of scar and cloud  seemed spread there  for her eyes alone  a strange fancy seized on helbeck  this was his  world  his world by inheritance and by love  five weeks before he had  walked about it as a solitary  and now this figure sat enthroned  as it  were  at the heart of it  he roughly shook the fancy off and walked on     miss fountain greeted him with her usual detachment  he stood a minute or  two irresolute  then threw himself on the slope in front of her      bruno will hardly look at his master now   he said to her pleasantly   pointing to the dog s attitude as it lay with its nose upon the hem of  her dress     laura closed her book in some annoyance  he usually returned by the other  side of the river  and she was not grateful to him for his breach of  habit  why had he been meddling in her affairs  she perfectly understood  why augustina had been making herself so difficult about the dance  and  about the masons in general  let him keep his proprieties to himself   she  laura  had nothing to do with them  she was hardly his guest  still  less his ward  she had come to bannisdale against her will  simply and  solely as augustina s nurse  in return  let mr  helbeck leave her alone  to enjoy her plebeian relations as she pleased     nevertheless  of course she must be civil  and civil she intermittently  tried to be  she answered his remark about bruno by a caress to the dog  that brought him to lay his muzzle against her knee      do you mind  some people do mind  i can easily drive him away       oh  no  i reckon on recovering him  some day   he said  with a frank  smile     laura flushed      very soon  i should think  have you noticed  mr  helbeck  how much  better augustina is already  i believe that by the end of the summer  at  least  she will be able to do without me  and she tells me that the  superior at the orphanage has a girl to recommend her as a companion when  i go       rather officious of the reverend mother  i think   said helbeck sharply   he paused a moment  then added with some emphasis   don t imagine  miss  fountain  that anybody else can do for my sister what you do       ah  but  well  one must live one s life  mustn t one  fricka    fricka  was by this time jealously pawing her dress   i want to work at my  music  hard  this winter       and i fear that bannisdale is not a very gay place for a young lady  visitor      he smiled  and so did she  though his tone  with its shade of proud  humility  embarrassed her      it is as beautiful as a dream   she said  with sudden energy  throwing  up her little hand  and he turned to look  as she was looking  at the  river and the woods      you feel the beauty of it so much   he asked her  wondering  his own  strong feeling for his native place was all a matter of old habit and  association  the flash of wild pleasure in her face astounded him  there  was in it that fiery  tameless something that was the girl s  distinguishing mark  her very soul and self  was it beginning to speak  from her blood to his     she nodded  then laughed      but  of course  it isn t my business to live here  i have a great  friend  a cambridge girl  and we have arranged it all  we are to live  together  and travel a great deal  and work at music       that is what young ladies do nowadays  i understand       and why not      he lifted his shoulders  as though to decline the answer  and was  silent  so silent that she was forced at last to take the field      don t you approve of  new women   mr  helbeck  oh  i wish i was a new  woman   she threw out defiantly   but i m not good enough  i don t know  anything       i wasn t thinking of them   he said simply   i was thinking of the life  that women used to live here  in this place  in the past  of my mother  and my grandmother      she could not help a stir of interest  what might the catholic women of  bannisdale have been like  she looked along the path that led downward to  the house  and seemed to see their figures upon it  not short and sickly  like augustina  but with the morning in their eyes and on their white  brows  like the romney lady  helbeck s thoughts meanwhile were peopled by  the more solid forms of memory      you remember the picture   he said at last  breaking the silence   the  husband of that lady was a boor and a gambler  he soon broke her heart   but her children consoled her to some extent  especially the daughters   several of whom became nuns  the poor wife came from a large lancashire  family  but she hardly saw her relations after her marriage  she was  ashamed of her husband s failings and of their growing poverty  she  became very shy and solitary  and very devout  these rock seats along the  river were placed by her  it is said that she used in summer to spend  long hours on that very seat where you are sitting  doing needlework  or  reading the little office of the virgin  at the hours when her daughters  in their french convent would be saying their office in chapel  she died  before her husband  a very meek  broken creature  i have a little book of  her meditations  that she wrote out by the wish of her confessor      then my grandmother  ah  well  that is too long a story  she was a  frenchwoman  we have some of her books in my study  she never got on with  england and english people  and at last  after her husband s death  she  never went outside the house and park  my father owed much of his shyness  and oddity to her bringing up  when she felt herself dying she went over  to her family to die at nantes  she is buried there  and my father was  sent to the jesuit school at nantes for a long time  then my mother  but  i mustn t bore you with these family tales      he turned to look at his listener  laura was by this time half  embarrassed  half touched      i should like to hear about your mother   she said rather stiffly      you may talk to me if you like  but don t  pray  presume upon it    that  was what her manner said     helbeck smiled a little  unseen  under his black moustache      my mother was a great lover of books  the only helbeck  i think  that  ever read anything  she was a friend and correspondent of cardinal  wiseman s  and she tried to make a family history out of the papers here   but in her later years she was twisted and crippled by rheumatic  gout  her poor fingers could not turn the pages  i used to help her  sometimes  but we none of us shared her tastes  she was a very happy  person  however      happy  why  laura felt a fresh prick of irritation as he paused  was she  never to escape  not even here  in the april sun  beside the river bank   for  of course  what all this meant was that the really virtuous and  admirable woman does not roam the world in search of art and friendship   she makes herself happy at home with religion and rheumatic gout     but helbeck resumed  and instantly it struck her that he had dropped a  sentence  and was taking up the thread further on      but there was no priest in the house then  for the society could not  spare us one  and very few services in the chapel  through all her young  days nothing could be poorer or raggeder than english catholicism  there  was no church at whinthorpe  sunday after sunday my father used to read  the prayers in the chapel  which was half a lumber room  i often think no  dissent could have been barer  but we heard mass when we could  and that  was enough for us  one of the priests from stonyhurst came when she died   this is her little missal      he raised it from the grass  a small volume bound in faded morocco  but  he did not offer to show it to miss fountain  and she felt no inclination  to ask for it      why did they live so much alone   she asked him  with a little frown   i  suppose there were always neighbours      he shook his head      a difference that has law and education besides religion behind it  goes  deep  times are changed  but it goes deep still      there was a pause  then she looked at him with a whimsical lifting of her  brows      bannisdale was not amusing   she said     he laughed good humouredly   not for a woman  certainly  for a man  yes   there was plenty of rough sport and card playing  and a good deal of  drinking  the men were full of character  often full of ability  but  there was no outlet  and a wretched education  my great grandfather might  have been saved by a commission in the army  but the law forbade it him   so they lived to themselves and by themselves  they didn t choose to live  with their protestant neighbours  who had made them outlaws and  inferiors  and  of course  they sank in manners and refinement  you may  see the results in all the minor catholic families to this day  that is   the old families  the few great houses that remained faithful escaped  many of the drawbacks of the position  the smaller ones suffered  and  succumbed  but they had their compensations      as he spoke he rose from the grass  and the dogs  springing up  barked  joyously about him      augustina will be waiting dinner for us  i think      laura  who had meant to stay behind  saw that she was expected to walk  home with him  she rose unwillingly  and moved on beside him      their compensations   that meant the mass and all the rest of this  tyrannous clinging religion  what did it honestly mean to mr  helbeck  to  anybody  she remembered her father s rough laugh   there are twelve  hundred men  my dear  belonging to the athenaeum club  i give you the  bishops  after them  what do you suppose religion has to say to the rest  of the twelve hundred  how many of them ever give a thought to it      she raised her eyes  furtively  to helbeck s face  in spite of its  melancholy lines  she had lately begun to see that its fundamental  expression was a contented one  that  no doubt  came from the   compensations   but to day there was more  she was positively startled  by his look of happiness as he strode silently along beside her  it was  all the more striking because of the plain traces left upon him by lenten  fatigue and  mortification      it was easter day  and she supposed he had come from communion     a little shiver passed through her  caused by the recollection of words  she had heard  acts of which she had been a witness  in the chapel during  the foregoing week  words and acts of emotion  of abandonment  love  crying to love  a momentary thirst seized her  an instant s sense of  privation  of longing  gone almost as soon as it had come     helbeck turned to her      so this dance you are going to is on thursday   he said pleasantly     she came to herself in a moment      yes  on thursday  at eight  i shall go early  i have engaged a fly to  take me to the farm  thank you   and my cousins will see me home  i am  obliged to you for the key  it will save my giving any trouble       if you did we should not grudge it   he said quietly     she was silent for a few more steps  then she said      i quite understand  mr  helbeck  that you do not approve of my going   but i must judge for myself  the masons are my own people  i am sorry  they should have     well  i don t understand  but it seems you have  reason to think badly of them       not of  them    he said with emphasis      of my cousin hubert  then      he made no answer  she coloured angrily  then broke out  her words  tumbling childishly over one another      there are a great many things said of hubert that i don t believe he  deserves  he has a great many good tastes  his music is wonderful  at any  rate  he is my cousin  they are papa s only relations in the world  he  would have been kind to hubert  and he would have despised me if i turned  my back on them because i was staying in a grand house with grand  people       grand people   said helbeck  raising his eyebrows   but i am sorry i led  you to say these things  miss fountain  excuse me  may i open this gate  for you      she reached her own room as quickly as possible  and dropped upon the  chair beside her dressing table in a whirl of angry feeling  a small and  heated face looked out upon her from the glass  but after the first  instinctive moment she took no notice of it  with the mind s eye she  still saw the figure she had just parted from  the noble poise of the  head  thrown back on the broad shoulders  the black and greys of the  hair  the clear penetrating glance  all the slight signs of age and  austerity that had begun to filch away the squire s youth  it was at  least ten minutes before she could free herself enough from the unwelcome  memories of her walk to find a vindictive pleasure in running hastily to  look at her one white dress  all she had to wear at the browhead dance                                                 on thursday afternoon helbeck was fishing in the park  the sea trout were  coming up  the day was soft  and he had done well  but just as the  evening rise was beginning he put up his rod and went home  father  leadham had taken his departure  augustina  miss fountain  and he were  again alone in the house     he went into his study  and left the door open  while he busied himself  with some writing     presently augustina put her head in  she looked dishevelled  and rather  pinker than usual  as always happened when there was the smallest  disturbance of her routine      laura has just gone up to dress  alan  is it fine       there is no rain   he said  without turning his head   don t shut the  door  please  this fire is oppressive      she went away  and he wrote on a little while  then listened  he heard  hurrying feet and movements overhead  and presently a door opened  hastily  and a voice exclaimed   just two or three  you know  ellen  from  that corner under the kitchen window  run  there s a good girl      and there was a clattering noise as ellen ran down the front stairs  and  then flew along the corridor to the garden door     in a minute she was back again  and as she passed his room helbeck saw  that she was carrying a bunch of white narcissus     then more sounds of laughter and chatter overhead  at last augustina  hurried down and looked in upon him again  flurried and smiling      alan  you really must see her  she looks so pretty       i am afraid i m busy   he said  still writing  and she retired  disappointed  careful  however  to follow his wishes about the door      augustina  hold bruno   cried a light voice suddenly   if he jumps on me  i m done for      a swish of soft skirts and she was there  in the hall  helbeck could see  her quite plainly as she stood by the oak table in her white dress  there  was just room at the throat of it for a pearl necklace  and at the wrists  for some thin gold bracelets  the narcissus were in her hair  which she  had coiled and looped in a wonderful way  so that helbeck s eyes were  dazzled by its colour and abundance  and by the whiteness of the slender  neck below it  she meanwhile was quite unconscious of his neighbourhood   and he saw that she was all in a happy flutter  hastily putting on her  gloves  and chattering alternately to augustina and to the transformed  ellen  who stood in speechless admiration behind her  holding a cloak      there  ellen  that ll do  you re a darling  and the flowers are perfect   run now  and tell mrs  denton that i didn t keep you more than twenty  minutes  oh  yes  augustina  i m quite warm  i can t choke  dear  even to  please you  there now  here goes  if you do lock me out  there s a corner  under the bridge  quite snug  my dress will mind  i shan t  good night   my compliments to mr  helbeck      then a hasty kiss to augustina and she was gone     helbeck went out into the hall  augustina was standing on the steps   watching the departing fly  at the sight of her brother she turned back  to him  her poor little face aglow      she did look so nice  alan  i wish she had gone to a proper dance  and  not to these odd farmers and people  why  they ll all go in their high  dresses  and think her stuck up       i assure you i never saw anything so smart as miss mason at the hunt  ball   said helbeck   did you give her the key  augustina  but i shall  probably sit up  there are some easter accounts that must be done                                                  the old clock in the hall struck one  helbeck was sitting in his familiar  chair before the log fire  which he had just replenished  in one hand was  a life of st  philip neri  the other played absently with bruno s ears   in truth he was not reading but listening     suddenly there was a sound  he turned his head  and saw that the door  leading from the hall to the tower staircase  and thence to the kitchen  regions  had been opened      who s there   he said in astonishment     mrs  denton appeared      you  denton  what are you up for at this time       i came to see if the yoong lady had coom back   she said in a low voice   and with her most forbidding manner   it s late  and i heard nowt       late  not at all  go to bed  denton  at once  miss fountain will be here  directly       i m not sleepy  i can wait for her   said the housekeeper  advancing a  step or two into the hall   you mun be tired  sir  and should take your  rest       i m not the least tired  thank you  good night  let me recommend you to  go to bed as quickly as possible      mrs  denton lingered for a moment  as though in hesitation  then went  with a sulky unwillingness that was very evident to her master     helbeck laid down his book on his knee with a little laugh      she would have liked to get in a scolding  but we won t give her the  chance      the reverie that followed was not a very pleasant one  he seemed to see  miss fountain in the large rustic room  with a bevy of young men about  her  young fellows in sunday coats  with shiny hair and limbs bursting  out of their ill fitting clothes  there would be loud talking and  laughter  rough jokes that would make her wince  compliments that would  disgust her  they not knowing how to take her  nor she them  she would be  wholly out of her place  a butt for impertinence  perhaps worse  and  there would be a certain sense of dragging a lady from her sphere  of  making free with the old house and the old family     he thought of it with disgust  he was an aristocrat to his fingers  ends     but how could it have been helped  and when he remembered her as she  stood there in the hall  so young and pretty  so eager for her pleasure   he said to himself with sudden heartiness      nonsense  i hope the child has enjoyed herself   it was the first time  that  even in his least formal thoughts  he had applied such a word to  her     silence again  the wind breathed gently round the house  he could hear  the river rushing     once he thought there was a sound of wheels and he went to the outer  door  but there was nothing  overhead the stars shone  and along the  track of the river lay a white mist     as he was turning back to the hall  however  he heard voices from the  mist  a loud man s voice  then a little cry as of some one in fright or  anger  then a song  the rollicking tune of it shouted into the night   into the stately stillness that surrounded the old house  had the  abruptest  unseemliest effect     helbeck ran down the steps  a dog cart with lights approached the gateway  in the low stone enclosure before the house  it shot through so fast and  so awkwardly as to graze the inner post  there was another little cry   then  with various lurches and lunges  the cart drove round the gravel   and brought up somewhere near the steps     hubert mason jumped down      who s that  mr  helbeck  o lord  glad to see yer  i m sure  there s that  little silly  she s been making such a  fuss all the way  thought i was  going to upset her into the river  i do believe  she would try and get at  the reins  though i told her it was the worst thing to do  whatever  to  be interfering with the driver  lord  i thought she d have used the whip  to me      and mason stood beside the shafts  with his arms on the side  laughing  loudly and looking at laura      stand out of the way  sir   said helbeck sternly   and let me help miss  fountain       oh  i say   come now  i m not going to stand you coming it over me twice  in the same sort  not i   cried the young man with a violent change of  tone    you  get out of the way  d  mn you  i brought miss fountain home   and she s my cousin  so there   not yours       hubert  go away at once   said laura s shaking but imperious voice   i  prefer that mr  helbeck should help me      she had risen and was clinging to the rail of the dog cart  while her  face drooped so that helbeck could not see it     mason stepped back with another oath  caught his foot in the reins  which  he had carelessly left hanging  and fell on his knees on the gravel      no matter   said helbeck  seeing that laura paused in terror   give me  your hand  miss fountain      she slipped on the step in the darkness  and helbeck caught her and set  her on her feet      go in  please  i will look after him      she ran up the steps  then turned to look     mason  still swearing and muttering  had some difficulty in getting up   helbeck stood by till he had risen and disentangled the reins      if you don t drive carefully down the park in the fog you ll come to  harm   he said  shortly  as mason mounted to his seat      that s none of your business   said mason sulkily   i brought my cousin  all right  i suppose i can take myself  now  come up  will you      he struck the pony savagely on the back with the reins  the tired animal  started forward  the cart swayed again from side to side  helbeck held  his breath as it passed the gate posts  but it shaved through  and soon  nothing but the gallop of retreating hoofs could be heard through the  night     he mounted the steps  and shut and barred the outer door  when he entered  the hall  laura was sitting by the oak table  one hand supporting and  hiding her face  the other hanging listlessly beside her     she struggled to her feet as he came in  the hood of her blue cloak had  fallen backwards  and her hair was in confusion round her face and neck   her cheeks were very white  and there were tears in her eyes  she had  never seemed to him so small  so childish  or so lovely     he took no notice of her agitation or of her efforts to speak  he went to  a tray of wine and biscuits that had been left by his orders on a  side table  and poured out some wine      no  i don t want it   she said  waving it away   i don t know what to  say          you would do best to take it   he said  interrupting her     his quiet insistence overcame her  and she drank it  it gave her back her  voice and a little colour  she bit her lip  and looked after helbeck as  he walked away to the farther end of the hall to light a candle for her      mr  helbeck   she began as he came near  then she gathered force   you  must  you ought to let me apologise       for what  i am afraid you had a disagreeable and dangerous drive home   would you like me to wake one of the servants  ellen  perhaps  and tell  her to come to you       oh  you won t let me say what i ought to say   she exclaimed in despair    that my cousin should have behaved like this  should have insulted  you          no  no   he said with some peremptoriness   your cousin insulted you by  daring to drive with you in such a state  that is all that matters to  me  or should  i think  matter to you  will you have your candle  and  shall i call anyone      she shook her head and moved towards the staircase  he accompanying her   when he saw how feebly she walked  he was on the point of asking her to  take his arm and let him help her to her room  but he refrained     at the foot of the stairs she paused  her  good night  died in her throat  as she offered her hand  her dejection  her girlish shame  made her  inexpressibly attractive to him  it was the first time he had ever seen  her with all her arms thrown down  but he said nothing  he bade her  good night with a cheerful courtesy  and  returning to the hall fire  he  stood beside it till he heard the distant shutting of her door     then he sank back into his chair and sat motionless  with knitted brows   for nearly an hour  staring into the caverns of the fire           chapter ii    laura awoke very early the following morning  but though the sun was  bright outside  it brought no gaiety to her  the night before she had  hurried her undressing  that she might bury herself in her pillow as  quickly as possible  and force sleep to come to her  it was her natural  instinct in the face of pain or humiliation  to escape from it by any  summary method was always her first thought   i will  i must go to  sleep   she had said to herself  in a miserable fury with herself and  fate  and by the help of an intense exhaustion sleep came     but in the morning she could do herself no more violence  memory took its  course  and a very disquieting course it was  she sat up in bed  with her  hands round her knees  thinking not only of all the wretched and untoward  incidents connected with the ball  but of the whole three weeks that had  gone before it  what had she been doing  how had she been behaving  that  this odious youth should have dared to treat her in such a way     fricka jumped up beside her  and laura held the dog s nose against her  cheek for comfort  while she confessed herself  oh  what a fool she had  been  why  pray  had she been paying all these visits to the farm  and  spending all these hours in this young fellow s company  her quick  intelligence unravelled all the doubtful skein  yearning towards her  kindred   yes  there had been something of that  recoil from the  bannisdale ways  an angry eagerness to scout them and fly them   yes   that there had always been in plenty  but she dived deeper into her  self disgust  and brought up the real bottom truth  disagreeable and  hateful as it was  mere excitement about a young man  as a young  man  mere love of power over a great hulking fellow whom other people  found unmanageable  aye  there it was  in spite of all the glosses she  had put upon it in her letters to molly friedland  all through  she had  known perfectly well that hubert mason was not her equal  that on a  number of subjects he had vulgar habits and vulgar ideas  that he often  expressed his admiration for her in a way she ought to have resented   there were whole sides of him  indeed  that she shrank from  exploring  that she wanted  nay  was determined  to know nothing about     on the other hand  her young daring  for want of any better prey  had  taken pleasure from the beginning in bringing him under her yoke  with  her second visit to the farm she saw that she could make him her  slave  that she had only to show him a little flattery  a little  encouragement  and he would be as submissive and obedient to her as he  was truculent and ill tempered towards the rest of the world  and her  vanity had actually plumed itself on so poor a prey  one excuse  yes   there was the one excuse  with her he had shown the side that she alone  of his kindred could appreciate  but for the fear of cousin elizabeth she  could have kept him hanging over the piano hour after hour while she  played  in a passion of delight  here was common ground  nay  in native  power he was her superior  though she  with her better musical training   could help and correct him in a thousand ways  she had the woman s  passion for influence  and he seemed like wax in her hands  why not help  him to education and refinement  to the cultivation of the best that was  in him  she would persuade cousin elizabeth  alter and amend his life for  him  and mr  helbeck should see that there were better ways of dealing  with people than by looking down upon them and despising them     and now the very thought of these vain and silly dreams set her face  aflame  power over him  let her only remember the humiliations  through  which she had been dragged  all the dance came back upon her  the strange  people  the strange young men  the strange  raftered room  with the noise  of the mill stream and the weir vibrating through it  and mingling with  the chatter of the fiddles  but she had been determined to enjoy it  to  give herself no airs  to forget with all her might that she was anyway  different from these dale folk  whose blood was hers  and with the older  people all had been easy  with the elderly women especially  in their  dark gowns and large sunday collars  she had felt herself at home  again  and again she had put herself under their wing  while in their silent way  they turned their shrewd motherly eyes upon her  and took stock of her  and every detail of her dress  and the old men  with their patriarchal  manners and their broad speech  it had been all sweet and pleasant to  her   noo  miss  they tell ma as yo  are stephen fountain s dowter  an i  mut meak bold ter cum an speak to thee  for a knew  un when he was a lile  lad   or  yo ll gee ma your hand  miss fountain  for we re pleased and  proud to git  yo  here  yer fadther an mea gaed to skule togedther  my  worrd  but he was parlish cliver  an i daursay as you teak afther him    kind folk  with all the signs of their hard and simple life about them     but the young men  how she had hated them   whether they were shy  or  whether they were bold  whether they romped with their sweethearts  and  laughed at their own jokes like bulls of bashan  or whether they wore  their best clothes as though the garments burnt them  and danced the  polka in a perspiring and anguished silence  no  she was not of  their   class  thank heaven  she never wished to be  one man had asked her to put  a pin in his collar  another had spilt a cup of coffee over her white  dress  a third had confided to her that his young lady was  that luvin   to him in public  he had been fair obliged to bid her  keep hersel to  hersel afore foak   the only partner with whom it had given her the  smallest pleasure to dance had been the schoolmaster and principal host  of the evening  a tall  sickly young man  who wore spectacles and talked  through his nose  but he talked of things she understood  and he danced  tolerably  alas  there had come the rub  hubert mason had stood sentinel  beside her during the early part of the evening  he had assumed the  proudest and most exclusive airs with regard to her  and his chief aim  seemed to be to impress upon her the prestige he enjoyed among his  fellows as a football player and an athlete  in the end his patronage and  his boasting had become insupportable to a girl of any spirit  and his  dancing  it seemed to her that he held her before him like a shield  and  then charged the room with her  she had found herself the centre of all  eyes  her pretty dress torn  her hair about her ears  so that she had  shaken him off  with too much impatience  no doubt  and too little  consideration for the touchiness of his temper  and then  what  stormy looks  what mutterings  what disappearances into the  refreshment room  and  finally  what  fierce jealousy of the  schoolmaster  laura awoke at last to the disagreeable fact that she had  to drive home with him  and he had already made her ridiculous  even  polly  the bedizened polly  looked grave  and there had been angry  conferences between her and her brother     then came the departure  laura by this time full of terrors  but not  knowing what to do  nor how else she was to get home  and  oh  that  grinning band of youths round the door  mason s triumphant leap into the  cart and boisterous farewell to his friends  and that first perilous  moment  when the pony had almost backed into the mill stream  and was  only set right again by half a dozen stalwart arms  amid the laughter of  the street     as for the wild drive through the dark  she shivered again  half with  anger  half with terror  as she thought of it  how had they ever got  home  she could not tell  he was drunk  of course  he seemed to her to  have driven into everything and over everything  abusing the schoolmaster  and mr  helbeck and his mother all the time  and turning upon her when  she answered him  or showed any terror of what might happen to them  now  with fury  and now with attempts at love making which it had taken all  her power over him to quell     their rush up the park had been like the ride of the wild horseman  every  moment she had expected to be in the river  and with the approach of the  house he had grown wilder and more unmanageable than before   dang it   let s wake up the old papist   he had said to her when she had tried to  stop his singing   what harm ll it do      as for the shame of their arrival  the very thought of mr  helbeck  standing silent on the steps as they approached  of hubert s behaviour   of her host s manner to her in the hall  made her shut her eyes and hide  her red face against fricka for sympathy  how was she ever to meet mr   helbeck again  to hold her own against him any more                                                 an hour later laura  very carefully dressed  and holding herself very  erect  entered augustina s room      oh  laura   cried mrs  fountain  as the door opened  she was very  flushed  and she stared from her bed at her stepdaughter in an agitated  silence     laura stopped short      well  what is it  augustina  what have you heard       laura  how  can  you do such things      and augustina  who already had her breakfast beside her  raised her  handkerchief to her eyes and began to cry  laura threw up her head and  walked away to a far window  where she turned and confronted mrs   fountain      well  he has been quick in telling you   she said  in a low but fierce  voice      he  what do you mean  my brother  as if he had said a word  i don t  believe he ever would  but mrs  denton heard it all       mrs  denton   said laura    mrs  denton   what on earth had she to do  with it       she heard you drive up  you know her room looks on the front       and she listened  sly old creature   said laura  recovering herself    well  it can t be helped  if she heard  she heard  and whatever i may  feel  i m not going to apologise to mrs  denton       but  laura  laura  was he         augustina could not finish the odious question      i suppose he was   said laura bitterly   it seems to be the natural  thing for young men of that sort       laura  do come here      laura came unwillingly  and augustina took her hands and looked up at  her      and  laura  he was abominably rude to alan       yes  he was  and i m very sorry   said the girl slowly   but it can t be  helped  and it s no good making yourself miserable  augustina       miserable  i  it s you  laura  who look miserable  i never saw you look  so white and dragged  you must never  never see him again      the girl s obstinacy awoke in a moment      i don t know that i shall promise that  augustina       oh  laura  as if you could wish to   said augustina  in tears      i can t give up my father s people   said the girl stiffly   but he  shall never annoy mr  helbeck again  i promise you that  augustina       oh  you did look so nice  laura  and your dress was so pretty      laura laughed  rather grimly      there s not much of it left this morning   she said   however  as one of  the gentlemen who kindly helped to ruin it said last night   lor  bless  yer  it ll wesh                                                   after breakfast laura found herself in the drawing room  looking through  an open window at the spring green in a very strained and irritable mood      i would not begin if i could not go on   she said to herself with  disdain  but her lip trembled     so mr  helbeck had taken offence  after all  hardly a word at breakfast   except such as the briefest  barest civility required  and he was going  away  it appeared  for three days  perhaps a week  on business  if he had  given her the slightest opening  she had meant to master her pride  sufficiently to renew her apologies and ask his advice  subject  of  course  to her own final judgment as to what kindred and kindness might  require of her  but he had given her no opening  and the subject was not   apparently  to be renewed between them     she might have asked him  too  to curb mrs  denton s tongue  but no  it  was not to be  very well  the girl drew her small frame together and  prepared  as no one thought for or befriended her  to think for and  befriend herself     she passed the next few days in some depression  mr  helbeck was absent   augustina was very ailing and querulous  and laura was made to feel that  it was her fault  not a word of regret or apology came from browhead  farm     meanwhile mrs  denton had apparently made her niece understand that there  was to be no more dallying with miss fountain  whenever she and laura  met  ellen lowered her head and ran  laura found that the girl was not  allowed to wait upon her personally any more  meanwhile the housekeeper  herself passed miss fountain with a manner and a silence which were in  themselves an insult     and two days after helbeck s departure  laura was crossing the hall  towards tea time  when she saw mrs  denton admitting one of the sisters  from the orphanage  it was the reverend mother herself  the portly  shrewd faced woman who had wished mr  helbeck a good wife  laura passed  her  and the nun saluted her coldly   dear me   you shall have augustina  to yourself  my good friend   thought miss fountain   don t be afraid    and she turned into the garden     an hour later she came back  as she opened the door in the old wall she  saw the sister on the steps  talking with mrs  denton  at sight of her  they parted  the nun drew her long black cloak about her  ran down the  steps  and hurried away     and indoors  laura could not imagine what had happened to her stepmother   augustina was clearly excited  yet she would say nothing  her  restlessness was incessant  and at intervals there were furtive tears   once or twice she looked at laura with the most tragic eyes  but as soon  as laura approached her she would hastily bury herself in her newspaper   or begin counting the stitches of her knitting     at last  after luncheon  mrs  fountain suddenly threw down her work with  a sigh that shook her small person from top to toe      i wish i knew what was wrong with you   said laura  coming up behind  her  and dropping a pair of soft hands on her shoulders   shall i get you  your new tonic       no   said augustina pettishly  then  with a rush of words that she could  not repress      laura  you must  you positively must give up that young man      laura came round and seated herself on the fender stool in front of her  stepmother      oh  so that s it  has anybody else been gossiping       i do wish you wouldn t  you wouldn t take things so coolly   cried  augustina   i tell you  the least trifle is enough to do a young girl of  your age harm  your father would have been so annoyed       i don t think so   said laura quietly   but who is it now  the reverend  mother      augustina hesitated  she had been recommended to keep things to herself   but she had no will to set against laura s  and she was  in fact   bursting with suppressed remonstrance      it doesn t matter  my dear  one never knows where a story of that kind  will go to  that s just what girls don t remember       who told a story  and what  i didn t see the reverend mother at the  dance       laura  but you never thought  my dear  you never knew  that there was a  cousin of father bowles  there  the man who keeps that little catholic  shop in market street  that s what comes  you see  of going to parties  with people beneath you       oh  a cousin of father bowles was there   said laura slowly   well  did  he make a pretty tale       laura  you are the most provoking  you don t the least understand what  people think  how could you go with him when everybody remonstrated       nobody remonstrated   said the girl sharply      his sister begged you not to go       his sister did nothing of the kind  she was staying the night in the  village  and there was literally nothing for me to do but come home with  hubert or to throw myself on some stranger       and such stories as one hears about this dreadful young man   cried  augustina      i dare say  there are always stories       i couldn t even tell you what they are about   said augustina   your  father would  certainly  have forbidden it altogether      there was a silence  laura held her head as high as ever  she was  in  fact  in a fever of contradiction and resentment  and the interference of  people like mrs  denton and the sisters was fast bringing about mason s  forgiveness  naturally  she was likely to hear the worst of him in that  house  what helbeck  or what dependent on a helbeck  would give him the  benefit of any doubt     augustina knitted with all her might for a few minutes  and then looked  up      don t you think   she said  with a timid change of tone   don t you  think  dear  you might go to cambridge for a few weeks  i am sure the  friedlands would take you in  you would come in for all the parties   and  and you needn t trouble about me  sister angela s niece could come  and stay here for a few weeks  the reverend mother told me so      laura rose      sister angela suggested that  thank you  i won t have my plans settled  for me by sister angela  if you and mr  helbeck want to turn me out  why   of course i shall go      augustina held out her hands in terror at the girl s attitude and voice      laura  don t say such things  as if you weren t an angel to me  as if i  could bear the thought of anybody else      a quiver ran through laura s features   well  then  don t bear it   she  said  kneeling down again beside her stepmother   you look quite ill and  excited  augustina  i think we ll keep the reverend mother out in future   won t you lie down and let me cover you up      so it ended for the time  with physical weakness on augustina s part  and  caresses on laura s     but when she was alone  miss fountain sat down and tried to think things  out      what are the sisters meddling for  do they find me in their way  i m  flattered  i wish i was  well   is drunkenness the worst thing in the  world   she asked herself deliberately   of course  if it goes beyond a  certain point it is like madness  you must keep out of its way  for your  own sake  but papa used to say there were many things a great deal worse   so there are   meanness  and shuffling with truth for the sake of your  soul  as for the other tales  i don t believe them  but if i did  i am  not going to marry him      she felt herself very wise  in truth  as stephen fountain had realised  with some anxiety before his death  among laura s many ignorances  none  was so complete or so dangerous as her ignorance of all the ugly ground  facts that are strewn round us  for the stumbling of mankind  she was as  determined not to know them  as he was invincibly shy of telling them     for the rest  her reflections represented  no doubt  many dicta that in  the course of her young life she had heard from her father  to stephen  fountain the whole christian doctrine of sin was  the enemy   and the  mystical hatred of certain actions and habits  as such  was the fount of  half the world s unreason     the following day it was father bowles  turn  he came over in what seemed  to be his softest and most catlike mood  rubbing his hands over his chest  in a constant glee at his own jokes  he was amiability itself to laura   but he  too  had his twenty minutes alone with augustina  and afterwards  mrs  fountain ventured once more to speak to laura of change and  amusement  miss fountain smiled  and replied as before  that  in the  first place she had no invitations  and in the next  she had no dresses   but again  as before  if mr  helbeck should express a wish that her visit  to bannisdale should come to an end  that would be another matter                                                 next morning laura was taking a walk in the park when a letter was  brought to her by old wilson  the groom  cowman  and general factotum     she took it to a sheltered nook by the riverside and read it  it was from  hubert mason  in his best commercial hand  and it ran as follows        dear miss fountain   you would not allow me  i know  to call you cousin  laura any more  so i don t attempt it  and of course i don t deserve  it  nor that you should ever shake hands with me again  i can t get over  thinking of what i ve done  mother and polly will tell you that i have  hardly slept at nights  for of course you won t believe me  how i can  have been such a blackguard i don t understand  i must have taken too  much  all i know is it didn t seem much  and but for the agitation of my  mind  i don t believe anything would ever have gone wrong  but i couldn t  bear to see you dancing with that man and despising me  and there it  is  i can never get over it  and you will never forgive me  i feel i  can t stay here any more  and mother has consented at last to let me have  some money on the farm  if i could just see you before i go  to say  good bye  and ask your pardon  there would be a better chance for me  i  can t come to mr  helbeck s house  of course  and i don t suppose you  would come here  i shall be coming home from kirby whardale fair  to morrow night  and shall be crossing the little bridge in the  park  upper end  some time between eight and nine  but i know you won t  be there  i can t expect it  and i feel it pretty badly  i can tell you   i did hope i might have become something better through knowing you   whatever you may think of me i am always     your respectful and humble cousin      hubert mason         well  upon my word   said laura  she threw the letter on to the grass  beside her  and sat  with her hands round her knees  staring at the  river  in a sparkle of anger and amazement     what audacity   to expect her to steal out at night  in the dusk   anyway  to meet him   him   she fed her wrath on the imagination of all  the details that would belong to such an escapade  it would be after  supper  of course  in the fast lengthening twilight  helbeck and his  sister would be in the drawing room  for mr  helbeck was expected home on  the following day  and she might perfectly well leave them  as she often  did  to talk their little catholic gossip by themselves  and then slip  out by the chapel passage and door  through the old garden  to the gate  in the wall above the river bank  and so to the road that led along the  greet through the upper end of the park  nothing  of course  could be  easier  nothing     merely to think of it  for a girl of laura s temperament  was already bit  by bit to incline to it  she began to turn it over  to taste the  adventure of it  to talk very fast to fricka  under her breath  with  little gusts of laughter  and no doubt there was something mollifying in  the boy s humble expressions  as for his sleepless nights  how salutary   how very salutary  only the nail must be driven in deeper  must be turned  in the wound     it would need a vast amount of severity  perhaps  to undo the effects of  her mere obedience to his call  supposing she made up her mind to obey  it  well  she would be quite equal to severity  she would speak very  plain things to him  very plain things indeed  it was her first serious  adventure with any of these big  foolish  troublesome creatures of the  male sex  and she rose to it much as helbeck might have risen to the  playing of a salmon in the greet  yes  he should say good bye to her  let  priests and nuns talk what scandal they pleased  yes  he should go on his  way forgiven and admonished  if he wished it  for kindred s sake     her cheek burned  her heart beat fast  he and she were of one blood  both  of them ill regarded by aristocrats and holy romans  as for him  he was  going to ruin at home  and there was in him this strange  artistic gift  to be thought for and rescued  he had all the faults of the young cub   was he to be wholly disowned for that  was she to cast him off for ever  at the mere bidding of the helbecks and their friends     he would never  of course  be allowed to enter the bannisdale  drawing room  and she had no intention at present of going to browhead  farm  well  then  under the skies and the clouds  a gracious pardon  an  appropriate lecture  and a short farewell                                                 all that day and the next laura gave herself to her whim  she was  perfectly conscious  meanwhile  that it was a reckless and a wilful thing  that she was planning  she liked it none the less for that  in fact  the  scheme was the final crystallisation of all that bitterness of mood that  had poisoned and tormented her ever since her first coming to bannisdale   and it gave her for the moment the morbid pleasure that all angry people  get from letting loose the angry word or act     meanwhile she became more and more conscious of a certain network of  blame and discussion that seemed to be closing about her and her actions   it showed itself by a number of small signs  when she went into  whinthorpe to shop for augustina she fancied that the assistants in the  shop  and even the portly draper himself  looked at her with a sly  curiosity  the girl s sore pride grew more unmanageable hour by hour  if  there was some ill natured gossip about her  going the round in the town  and the neighbourhood  had she  till now  given the least shadow of  excuse for it  not the least shade of a shadow                                                 mr  helbeck  his sister  and laura were in the drawing room after supper   laura had been observing mrs  fountain closely      she is longing to have her talk with him   thought the girl   and she  shall have it  as much as she likes      the shutters were not yet closed  and the room  with its crackling logs   was filled with a gentle mingled light  the sun  indeed  was gone  but  the west still glowed  and the tall larches in the front enclosure stood  black against a golden dome of sky  laura rose and left the room  as she  opened the door she caught augustina s quick look of relief and the drop  of the knitting needles     fricka was safely prisoned upstairs  laura slipped on a hat and a dark  cloak that were hanging in the hall  and ran down the passage leading to  the chapel  the heavy seventeenth century door at the end of it took her  some trouble to open without noise  but it was done at last  and she was  in the old garden     her little figure in its cloak  among the dark yews  was hardly to be  seen in the dusk  the garden was silence itself  and the gate in the wall  was open  once on the road beside the river she could hardly restrain  herself from running  so keen was the air  so free and wide the evening  solitude  all things were at peace  nothing moved but a few birds and the  tiniest intermittent breeze  overhead  great thunderclouds kept the  sunset  beneath  the blues of the evening were all interwoven with rose   so  too  were the wood and sky reflections in the gently moving water  in  some of the pools the trout were still lazily rising  pigeons and homing  rooks were slowly passing through the clear space that lay between the  tree tops and the just emerging stars  and once laura stopped  holding  her breath  thinking that she saw through the dusk the blue flash of a  kingfisher making for a nest she knew  even in this dimmed light the  trees had the may magnificence  all but the oaks  which still dreamed of  a best to come  here and there a few tufts of primroses  on the bosom of  the crag above the river  lonely and self sufficing  like all loveliest  things  starred the dimness of the rock     laura s feet danced beneath her  the evening beauty and her passionate  response flowed as it were into each other  made one beating pulse   never  in spite of qualms and angers  had she been more physically happy   more alive  she passed the seat where she and helbeck had lingered on  easter sunday  then she struck into a path high above the river  under  spreading oaks  and presently a little bridge came in sight  with some  steps in the crag leading down to it     at the near end of the bridge  thrown out into the river a little way for  the convenience of fishermen  was a small wooden platform  with a  railing  which held a seat  the seat was well hidden under the trees and  bank  and laura settled herself there     she had hardly waited five minutes  absorbed in the sheer pleasure of the  rippling river and the soft air  when she heard steps approaching the  bank  looking up  she saw mason s figure against the sky  he paused at  the top of the rocky staircase  to scan the bridge and its approaches   not seeing her  he threw up his hand  with some exclamation that she  could not hear     she smiled and rose     as her small form became visible between the paleness of the wooden  platform and a luminous patch in the river  she heard a cry  then a  hurrying down the rock steps     he stopped about a yard from her  she did not offer her hand  and after  an instant s pause  during which his eyes tried to search her face in the  darkness  he took off his hat and drew his hand across his brow with a  deep breath      i never thought you d come   he said huskily      well  certainly you had no business to ask me  and i can only stay a  very few minutes  suppose you sit down there      she pointed to one of the rock steps  while she settled herself again on  the seat  some little distance away from him     then there was an awkward silence  which laura took no trouble to break   mason broke it at last in desperation      you know that i m an awful hand at saying anything  miss  miss fountain   i can t  so it s no good  but i ve got my lesson  i ve had a pretty rough  time of it  i can tell you  since last week       you behaved about as badly as you could  didn t you   said laura s soft  yet cutting voice out of the dark     mason fidgeted      i can t make it no better   he said at last   there s no saying i can   for i can t  and if i did give you excuses  you d not believe  em  there  was a devil got hold of me that evening  that s the truth on t  and it  was only a glass or two i took  well  there   i d have cut my hand off  sooner      his tone of miserable humility began to affect her rather strangely  it  was not so easy to drive in the nail      you needn t be so repentant   she said  with a little shrinking laugh    one has to forget  everything  in good time  you ve given whinthorpe  people something to talk about at my expense  for which i am not at all  obliged to you  you nearly killed me  which doesn t matter  and you  behaved disgracefully to mr  helbeck  but it s done  and now you ve got  to make up  somehow       has he made you pay for it  since   said mason eagerly      he  mr  helbeck   she laughed  then she added  with all the severity  she could muster   he treated me in a most kind and gentlemanly  way  if you want to know  the great pity is that you  and cousin  elizabeth  understand nothing at all about him      he groaned  she could hear his feet restlessly moving      well  and now you are going to froswick   she resumed   what are you  going to do there       there s an uncle of mine in one of the shipbuilding yards there  he s  got leave to take me into the fitting department  if i suit he ll get me  into the office  it s what i ve wanted this two years       well  now you ve got it   she said impatiently   don t be dismal  you  have your chance       yes  and i don t care a haporth about it   he said  with sudden energy   throwing his head up and bringing his fist down on his knee     she felt her power  and liked it  but she hurried to answer      oh  yes you do  if you re a man  you  must   you ll learn a lot of new  things  you ll keep straight  because you ll have plenty to do  why  it  will  hatch you over again  and hatch  you different   as somebody said   you ll see      he looked at her  trying hard to catch her expression in the dusk      and if i do come back different  perhaps  perhaps  soom day you ll not  be ashamed to be seen wi  me  look here  miss laura  from the first time  i set eyes on you  from that day you came up  that sunday  i haven t been  able to settle to a thing  i felt  right enough  i wasn t fit to speak to  you  and yet i m your  well  your kith and kin  doan t you see  there  can t be no such tremendous gap atween us as all that  if i can just  manage myself a bit  and find the work that suits me  and get away from  these fellows here  and this beastly farm          ah   have you been quarrelling with daffady all day      she looked for him to fly out  but he only stared  and then turned away      o lord  what s the good of talking   he said  with an accent that  startled her     she rose from her seat      are you sorry i came to talk to you  you didn t deserve it  did you      her voice was the pearliest  most musical  and yet most distant of  things  he rose  too  held by it      and now you must just go and make a man of yourself  that s what you  have to do  you see  i wish papa was alive  he d tell you how  i can t   but if you forget your music  it ll be a sin  and if you send me your  song to write out for you  i ll do it  and tell polly i ll come and see  her again some day  now good night  they ll be locking up if i don t  hurry home      but he stood on the step  barring the way      i say  give me something to take with me   he said hoarsely   what s  that in your hat       in my hat   she said  laughing   but if there had been light he would  have seen that her lips had paled    why  a bunch of buttercups  i bought  them at whinthorpe yesterday       give me one   he said      give you a sham buttercup  what nonsense       it s better than nothing   he said doggedly  and he held out his hand     she hesitated  then she took off her hat and quietly loosened one of the  flowers  her golden hair shone in the dimness  mason never took his eyes  off her little head  he was keeping a grip on himself that was taxing a  whole new set of powers  straining the lad s unripe nature in wholly new  ways     she put the flower in his hand      there  now we re friends again  aren t we  let me pass  please  and  good night      he moved to one side  blindly fighting with the impulse to throw his  powerful arms round her and keep her there  or carry her across the  bridge  at his pleasure     but her light fearlessness mastered him  he let her go  he watched her  figure on the steps  against the moonlight between the oaks overhead      good night   she dropped again  already far away  far above him     the young man felt a sob in his throat      my god  i shan t ever see her again   he said to himself in a sudden  terror   she is going to that house  to that man      for the first time a wild jealousy of helbeck awoke in him  he rushed  across the bridge  dropped on a stone half way up the further bank  then  strained his eyes across the river         yes  there she passed  a swift moving whiteness  among the great  trees that stood like watchmen along the high edge of the water  below  him flowed the stream  a gulf of darkness  rent here and there by sheets  and jags of silver  and she  that pale wraith  across it  far away  was  flitting from his ken     all the fountains of the youth s nature surged up in one great outcry and  confusion  he thought of his boyish loves and sensualities  of the girls  who had provoked them  of some of the ugly facts connected with them  a  great astonishment  a great sickening  came upon him  he felt the burden  of the flesh  the struggle of the spirit  and through it all  the maddest  and most covetous yearning   welling up through schemes and hopes  that  like the moonlit ripples on the greet  dissolved as fast as they took  shape                                                 meanwhile laura went quickly home  a new tenderness  a new remorse  towards the  cub  was in the girl s mind  ought she to have gone  had she  been kind  oh  she would be his friend and good angel  without any  nonsense  of course     she hurried through the trees and along the dimly gleaming path  suddenly  she perceived in the distance the sparkle of a lantern     how vexatious  was there no escape for her  she looked in some trouble at  the climbing woods above  at the steep bank below     ah  well  her hat was large  and hid her face  and her dress was all  covered by her cloak  she hastened on     it was a man  an old man  carrying a bundle and a lantern  he seemed to  waver and stop as she approached him  and at the actual moment of her  passing him  to her amazement  he suddenly threw himself against one of  the trees on the mountain side of the path  and his lantern showed her  his face for an instant  a white face  stricken with  fear  was it  or  what     fright gained upon herself  she ran on  and as she ran it seemed to her  that she heard something fall with a clang  and  afterwards  a cry  she  looked back  the old man was still there  erect  but his light was gone     well  no doubt he had dropped his lantern  let him light it again  it was  no concern  of hers     here was the door in the wall  it opened to her touch  she glided  in  across the garden  found the chapel door ajar  and in a few more  seconds was safe in her own room           chapter iii    laura was standing before her looking glass straightening the curls that  her rapid walk had disarranged  when her attention was caught by certain  unusual sounds in the house  there was a hurrying of distant feet  calls   as though from the kitchen region  and lastly  the deep voice of mr   helbeck  miss fountain paused  brush in hand  wondering what had  happened     a noise of fluttering skirts  and a cry for  laura    miss fountain  opened her door  and saw augustina  who never ran  hurrying as fast as  her feebleness would let her  towards her stepdaughter      laura   where is my sal volatile  you gave me some yesterday  you  remember  for my headache  there s somebody ill  downstairs      she paused for breath      here it is   said laura  finding the bottle  and bringing it   what s  wrong       oh  my dear  such an adventure  there s an old man fainted in the  kitchen  he came to the back door to ask for a light for his lantern   mrs  denton says he was shaking all over when she first saw him  and as  white as her apron  he told her he d seen the ghost   i ve often heard  tell o  the bannisdale lady   he said   an now i ve seen her   she asked  him to sit down a minute to rest himself  and he fainted straight away   he s that old scarsbrook  you know  whose wife does our washing  they  live in that cottage by the weir  the other end of the park  i must go   mrs  denton s giving him some brandy  and alan s gone down  isn t it an  extraordinary thing       very   said laura  accompanying her stepmother along the passage   what  did he see      she paused  laying a restraining hand on augustina s arm  cudgelling her  brains the while  yes  she could remember now a few contemptuous remarks  of mr  helbeck to father leadham on the subject of a ghost story that had  sprung up during the squire s memory in connection with the park and the  house  a quite modern story  according to helbeck  turning on the common  motive of a gypsy woman and her curse  started some forty years before  this date  with a local success not a little offensive  apparently  to  the owner of bannisdale      what did he see   repeated the girl   don t hurry  augustina  you know  the doctor told you not  shall i take the sal volatile       oh  no   they want me   in any matter of doctoring small or great   augustina had the happiest sense of her own importance   i don t know  what he saw exactly  it was a lady  he says  he knew it was  by the hat  and the walk  she was all in black  with  a dolly varden hat   fancy the  old fellow   that hid her face  and a little white hand  that shot out  sparks as he came up to her  did you ever hear such  a tale  now  laura   i m all right  let me go  come when you like      augustina hurried off  laura was left standing pensive in the passage      h m  that s unlucky   she said to herself     then she looked down at her right hand  an old fashioned diamond ring  with a large centre stone  which had been her mother s  shone on the  third finger  with an involuntary smile  she drew off the ring  and went  back to her room      what s to be done now   she thought  as she put the ring in a drawer    shall i go down and explain  say i was out for a stroll    she shook her  head    won t do now  i should have had more presence of mind a minute  ago  augustina would suspect a hundred things  it s really dramatic   shall i go down  he didn t see my face  no  that i ll answer for  here s  for it      she pulled out the golden mass of her hair till it made a denser frame  than usual round her brow  looked at her white dress  shook her head  dubiously  laughed at her own flushed face in the glass  and calmly went  downstairs     she found an anxious group in the great bare servants  hall  the old man   supported by pillows  was stretched on a wooden settle  with helbeck   augustina  and mrs  denton standing by  the first things she saw were the  old peasant s closed eyes and pallid face  then helbeck s grave and  puzzled countenance above him  the squire turned at miss fountain s step   did she imagine it  or was there a peculiar sharpness in his swift  glance     mrs  denton had just been administering a second dose of brandy  and was  apparently in the midst of her own report to her master of scarsbrook s  story       i wor just aboot to pass her   he said   when i nawticed  at her feet  made noa noise  she keaem glidin  an glidin  an my hair stood reet oop  it  lifted t whole top o  my yed  an she gaed passt me like a puff o   wind  as cauld as ice  an i wor mair deed nor alive  an i luked afther  her  an she vanisht i  th  varra middle o  t  path  an my leet went  oot  an i durstn t ha gane on  if it wor iver so  so i juist crawled back  tet hoose           the door in the wall   thought laura   he didn t know it was there      she had remained in the background while mrs  denton was speaking  but  now she approached the settle  mrs  denton threw a sour look at her  and  flounced out of her way  helbeck silently made room for her  as she  passed him  she felt instinctively that his distant politeness had become  something more pronounced  he left her questions to augustina to answer   and himself thrust his hands into his pockets and moved away      have you sent for anyone   said laura to mrs  fountain      yes  wilson s gone in the pony cart for the wife  and if he doesn t come  round by the time she gets here  some one will have to go for the doctor   alan      she looked round vaguely      of course  wilson must go on   said helbeck from the distance   or i ll  go myself       but he is coming round   said laura  pointing      if yo ll nobbut move oot o  t  way  miss  we ll be able to get at  im    said mrs  denton sharply  laura hastily obeyed her  the housekeeper  brought more brandy  then signs of returning force grew stronger  and by  the time the wife appeared the old fellow was feebly beginning to move  and look about him     amid the torrent of lamentations  questions  and hypotheses that the wife  poured forth  laura withdrew into the background  but she could not  prevail on herself to go  daring or excitement held her there  till the  old man should be quite himself again     he struggled to his feet at last  and said  with a long sigh that was  still half a shudder   aye  noo i ll goa home  lisbeth      he was a piteous spectacle as he stood there  still trembling through all  his stunted frame  his wrinkled face drawn and bloodless  his grey hair  in a tragic confusion  suddenly  as he looked at his wife  he said with a  clear solemnity   lisbeth  i ha  got my death warrant       don t say any such thing  scarsbrook   said helbeck  coming forward to  support him   you know i don t believe in this ghost business  and never  did  you saw some stranger in the park  and she passed you too quickly  for you to see where she went to  you may be sure that ll turn out to be  the truth  you remember  it s a public path  anybody might be there  just  try and take that view of it  and don t fret  for your wife s sake  we ll  make inquiries  and i ll come and see you to morrow  and as for death  warrants  we re all in god s care  you know  don t forget that      he smiled with a kindly concern and pity on the old man  but scarsbrook  shook his head      it wur t  bannisdale lady   he repeated   i ve often heerd on  her  often  and noo i ve seen her       well  to morrow you ll be quite proud of it   said helbeck cheerfully    come  and let me put you into the cart  i think  if we make a  comfortable seat for you  you ll be fit to drive home now      supported by the squire s strong arm on one side  and his wife on the  other  scarsbrook managed to hobble down the long passage leading to the  door in the inner courtyard  where the pony cart was standing  it was  evident that his perceptions were still wholly dazed  he had not  recognised or spoken to anyone in the room but the squire  not even to  his old crony mrs  denton     laura drew a long breath      augustina  do go to bed   she said  going up to her stepmother   or  you ll be ill next      augustina allowed herself to be led upstairs  but it was long before she  would let her stepdaughter leave her  she was full of supernatural  terrors and excitements  and must talk about all the former appearances  of the ghost  the stories that used to be told in her childhood  the new  or startling details in the old man s version  and so forth   what could  he have meant by the light on the hand   she said wondering   i never  heard of that before  and she used always to be in grey  and now he says  that she had a black dress from top to toe       their wardrobes are so limited  poor damp  sloppy things   said laura  flippantly  as she brushed her stepmother s hair   do you suppose this  nonsense will be all over the country side to morrow  augustina       what do you  really  think he saw  laura   cried mrs  fountain  wavering  between doubt and belief      goodness   don t ask me   miss fountain shrugged her small shoulders   i  don t keep a family ghost                                                  when at last augustina had been settled in bed  and persuaded to take  some of her sleeping medicine  laura was bidding her good night  when  mrs  fountain said   oh  i forgot  laura  there was a letter brought in  for you from the post office  by wilson this afternoon  he gave it to  mrs  denton  and she forgot it till after dinner          of course  because it was mine   said laura vindictively   where is it       on the drawing room chimney piece       all right  i ll go for it  but i shall be disturbing mr  helbeck       oh  no  it s much too late  alan will have gone to his study      miss fountain stood a moment outside her stepmother s door  consulting  her watch     for she was anxious to get her letter  and not at all anxious to fall in  with mr  helbeck  at least  so she would have explained herself had  anyone questioned her  in fact  her wishes and intentions were in  tumultuous confusion  all the time that she was waiting on augustina  her  brain  her pulse was racing  in the added touch of stiffness which she  had observed in helbeck s manner  she easily divined the result of that  conversation he had no doubt held with augustina after dinner  while she  was by the river  did he think even worse of her than he had before   well   if he and augustina could do without her  let them send her  away  by all manner of means  she had her own friends  her own money  was  in all respects her own mistress  and only asked to be allowed to lead  her life as she pleased     nevertheless  as she crossed the darkness of the hall  with her candle in  her hand  laura fountain was very near indeed to a fit of wild weeping   during the months following her father s death  these agonies of crying  had come upon her night after night  unseen by any human being  she felt  now the approach of an old enemy and struggled with it   one mustn t have  this excitement every night   she said to herself  half mocking   no  nerves would stand it      a light under the library door  well and good  how  she wondered  did he  occupy himself there  through so many solitary hours  once or twice she  had heard him come upstairs to bed  and never before one or two o clock     suddenly she stood abashed  she had thrown open the drawing room door   and the room lay before her  almost in darkness  one dim lamp still  burned at the further end  and in the middle of the room stood mr   helbeck  arrested in his walk to and fro  and the picture of  astonishment     laura drew back in real discomfiture   oh  i beg your pardon  mr   helbeck  i had no notion that anyone was still here       is there anything i can do for you   he said advancing      augustina told me there was a letter for me this evening       of course  it is here on the mantelpiece  i ought to have remembered  it      he took up the letter and held it towards her  then suddenly he paused   and sharply withdrawing it  he placed it on a table beside him  and laid  his hand upon it  she saw a flash of quick resolution in his face  and  her own pulses gave a throb      miss fountain  will you excuse my detaining you for a moment  i have  been thinking much about this old man s story  and the possible  explanation of it  it struck me in a very singular way  as you know  i  have never paid much attention to the ghost story here  we have never  before had a testimony so direct  is it possible  that you might throw  some light upon it  you left us  you remember  after dinner  did you by  chance go into the garden   the evening was tempting  i think  if so   your memory might possibly recall to you some  slight thing       yes   she said  after a moment s hesitation   i did go into the garden      his eye gleamed  he came a step nearer      did you see or hear anything  to explain what happened      she did not answer for a moment  she made a vague movement  as though to  recover her letter  looked curiously into a glass case that stood beside  her  containing a few stuart relics and autographs  then  with absolute  self possession  she turned and confronted him  one hand resting on the  glass case      yes  i can explain it all  i was the ghost      there was a moment s silence  a smile  a smile that she winced under   showed itself on helbeck s lip      i imagined as much   he said quietly     she stood there  torn by different impulses  then a passion of annoyance  with herself  and anger with him  descended on her      now perhaps you would like to know why i concealed it   she said  with  all the dignity she could command   simply  because i had gone out to  meet and say good bye to a person  who is my relation  whom i cannot meet  in this house  and against whom there is here an unreasonable    she  hesitated  then resumed  leaning obstinately on the words   yes  take it  all in all  it  is  an unreasonable prejudice       you mean mr  hubert mason      she nodded      you think it an unreasonable prejudice after what happened the other  night      she wavered      i don t want to defend what happened the other night   she said  while  her voice shook     helbeck observed her carefully  there was a great decision in his manner   and at the same time a fine courtesy      you knew  then  that he was to be in the park  forgive my questions   they are not mere curiosity       perhaps not   she said indifferently   but i think i have told you all  that needs to be told  may i have my letter      she stepped forward      one moment  i wonder  miss fountain    he chose his words slowly   if i  could make you understand my position  it is this  my sister brings a  young lady  her stepdaughter  to stay under my roof  that young lady  happens to be connected with a family in this neighbourhood  which is  already well known to me  for some of its members i have nothing but  respect  about one i happen to have a strong opinion  i have reasons  for  my opinion  i imagine that very few people of any way of thinking would  hold me either unreasonable or prejudiced in the matter  naturally  it  gives me some concern that a young lady towards whom i feel a certain  responsibility should be much seen with this young man  he is not her  equal socially  and  pardon me  she knows nothing at all about the type  to which he belongs  indirectly i try to warn her  i speak to my sister  as gently as i can  but from the first she rejects all i have to say  she  gives me credit for no good intention  and she will have none of my  advice  at last a disagreeable incident happens  and unfortunately the  knowledge of it is not confined to ourselves         laura threw him a flashing look      no   there are people who have taken care of that   she said     helbeck took no notice      it is known not only to ourselves   he repeated steadily   it starts  gossip  my sister is troubled  she asks you to put an end to this state  of things  and she consults me  feeling that indeed we are all in some  way concerned       oh  say at once that i have brought scandal on you all   cried laura    that of course is what sister angela and father bowles have been saying  to augustina  they are pleased to show the greatest anxiety about me  so  much so  that they most kindly wish to relieve me of the charge of  augustina   so i understand  but i fear i am neither docile nor  grateful   that i never shall be grateful         helbeck interrupted      let us come to that presently  i should like to finish my story  while  my sister and i are consulting  trying to think of all that can be done  to stop a foolish talk and undo an unlucky incident  this same young  lady   his voice took a cold clearness   steals out by night to keep an  appointment with this man  who has already done her so great a  disservice  now i should like to ask her  if all this is kind  is  reasonable  is generous towards the persons with whom she is at present  living  if such conduct is not   he paused   unwise towards  herself  unjust towards others      his words came out with a strong and vibrating emphasis  laura confronted  him with crimson cheeks      i think that will do  mr  helbeck   she cried   you have had your  say   now just let me say this   these people were my relations  i have  no other kith and kin in the world      he made a quick step forward as though in distress  but she put up her  hand      i want very much to say this  please  i knew perfectly well when i came  here that you couldn t like the masons  for many reasons   her voice  broke again   you never liked augustina s marriage  you weren t likely to  want to see anything of papa s people  i didn t ask you to see them  all  my standards and theirs are different from yours  but i prefer  theirs  not yours  i have nothing to do with yours  i was brought  up  well  to  hate  yours  if one must tell the truth      she paused  half suffocated  her chest heaving  helbeck s glance  enveloped her  took in the contrast between her violent words and the  shrinking delicacy of her small form  a great melting stole over the  man s dark face  but he spoke dryly enough      i imagine the standards of protestants and catholics are pretty much  alike in matters of this kind  but don t let us waste time any more over  what has already happened  i should like  i confess  to plead with you as  to the future      he looked at her kindly  even entreatingly  all through this scene she  had been unwittingly  angrily conscious of his personal dignity and  charm  a dignity that seemed to emerge in moments of heightened action or  feeling  and to slip out of sight again under the absent hermit manner of  his ordinary life  she was smarting under his words  ready to concentrate  a double passion of resentment upon them  as soon as she should be alone  and free to recall them  and yet         as to the future   she said coldly   that is simple enough as far as one  person is concerned  hubert mason is going to froswick immediately  into  business       i am glad to hear it  it will be very much for his good      he stopped a moment  searching for the word of persuasion and  conciliation      miss fountain   if you imagine that certain incidents which happened  here long before you came into this neighbourhood had anything to do with  what i have been saying now  let me assure you  most earnestly  that it  is not so  i recognise fully that with regard to a certain case  of which  you may have heard  the masons and their friends honestly believed that  wrong and injustice had been done  they attempted personal violence  i  can hardly be expected to think it argument  but i bear them no malice  i  say this because you may have heard of something that happened three or  four years ago  a row in the streets  when father bowles and i were set  upon  it has never weighed with me in the slightest  and i could have  shaken hands with old mason  who was in the crowd  and refused to stop  the stone throwing  the day after  as for mrs  mason   he looked up with  a smile   if she could possibly have persuaded herself to come with her  daughter and see you here  my welcome would not have been wanting  but   you know  she would as soon visit gehenna  nobody could be more conscious  than i  miss fountain  that this is a dreary house for a young lady to  live in  and         the colour mounted into his face  but he did not shrink from what he  meant to say      and you have made us all feel that you regard the practices and  observances by which we try to fill and inspire our lives  as mere  hateful folly and superstition   he checked himself   is that too  strong   he added  with a sudden eagerness   if so  i apologise for and  withdraw it      laura  for a moment  was speechless  then she gathered her forces  and  said  with a voice she in vain tried to compose      i think you exaggerate  mr  helbeck  at any rate  i hope you do  but the  fact is  i  i ought not to have tried to bear it  considering all that  had happened at home  it was more than i had strength for  and  perhaps  no good will come of going on with it  and it had better cease   mr  helbeck   if your superior can really find a good nurse and companion  at once  will you kindly communicate with her  i will go to cambridge  immediately  as soon as i can arrange with my friends  augustina  no  doubt  will come and stay with me somewhere at the sea  later on in the  year      helbeck had been listening to her  to the sharp determination of her  voice  in total silence  he was leaning against the high mantelpiece  and  his face was hidden from her  as she ceased to speak  he turned  and his  mere aspect beat down the girl s anger in a moment  he shook his head  sadly      dr  macbride stopped me on the bridge yesterday  as he was coming away  from the house      laura drew back  her eyes fastened upon him      he thinks her in a serious state  we are not to alarm her  or interfere  with her daily habits  there is valvular disease  as i think you  know  and it has advanced  neither he nor anyone can forecast      the girl s head fell  she recognised that the contest was over  she could  not go  she could not leave augustina  and the inference was clear  there  had not been a word of menace  but she understood  mr  helbeck s will  must prevail  she had brought this humiliating half hour on herself  and  she would have to bear the consequences of it  she moved towards helbeck      well then  i must stay   she said huskily   and i must try to  to  remember where i am in future  i ought to be able to hide everything i  feel  of course  but that unfortunately is what i never learnt   and  there are some ways of life  that  that are too far apart   however    she raised her hand to her brow  frowned  and thought a  little   i can t make any promise about my cousins  mr  helbeck   i  know  perfectly well  whatever may be said  that i have done nothing whatever  to be ashamed of  i have wanted to  to help my cousin  he is worth  helping  in spite of everything  and i  will  help him  if i can  but if  i am to remain your guest  i see that i must consult your wishes         helbeck tried again to stop her with a gesture  but she hurried on      as far as this house and neighbourhood are concerned  no one shall have  any reason  to talk      then she threw her head back with a sudden flush      of course  if people are born to say and think ill natured things   like  mrs  denton         helbeck exclaimed      i will see to that   he said   you shall have no reason to complain   there      laura shrugged her shoulders      will you kindly give me my letter      as he handed it to her  she made him a little bow  walked to the door  before he could open it for her  and was gone     helbeck turned back  with a smothered exclamation  he put the lamps out   and went slowly to his study                                                 as the master of bannisdale closed the door of his library behind him   the familiar room produced upon him a sharp and singular impression  the  most sacred and the most critical hours of his life had been passed  within its walls  as he entered it now  it seemed to repulse him  to be  no longer his     the room was not large  it was the old library of the house  and the  helbecks in their palmiest days had never been a literary race  there was  a little seventeenth century theology  and a few english classics  there  were the french books of helbeck s grandmother   madame   as she was  always known at bannisdale  and amongst them the worn brown volumes of  st  francois de sales  with the yellowish paper slips that madame had put  in to mark her favourite passages  somewhere in the days of the first  empire  near by were some stray military volumes  treatises on tactics  and fortification  that had belonged to a dashing young officer in the  dillon regiment  close to some  epitres amoureux   a translation of   daphnis and chloe   and the like  all now sunk together into the same  dusty neglect     on the wall above helbeck s writing table were ranged the books that had  been his mother s  together with those that he himself habitually used   here every volume was an old friend  a familiar tool  alan helbeck was  neither a student nor a man of letters  but he had certain passionate  prejudices  instincts  emotions  of which some books were the source and  sustenance     for the rest  during some years he had been a member of the third order  of st  francis  and in its other features the room was almost the room of  a religious  a priedieu stood against the inner wall  and a crucifix hung  above it  a little further on was a small altar of st  joseph with its  pictures  its statuette  and its candles  and a poor lithograph of pio  nono looked down from the mantelpiece  the floor was almost bare  save  for a few pieces of old matting here and there  the worn turkey carpet  that had formerly covered it had been removed to make the drawing room  comfortable for augustina  so had most of the chairs  those left were of  the straightest and hardest     in that dingy room  however  helbeck had known the most blessed  the most  intimate moments of the spiritual life  to night he entered it with a  strange sense of wrench  of mortal discouragement  mechanically he went  to his writing table  and  sitting down before it  he took a key from his  watch chain and opened a large locked note book that lay upon it     the book contained a number of written meditations  a collection of  passages and thoughts  together with some faded photographs of his  mother  and of his earliest jesuit teachers at stonyhurst     on the last page was a paragraph that only the night before he had copied  from one of his habitual books of devotion  copying it as a spiritual  exercise  making himself dwell upon every word of it       when shall i desire thee alone  feed on thee alone  o my delight  my  only good  o my loving and almighty lord  free now this wretched heart  from every attachment  from every earthly affection  adorn it with thy  holy virtues  and with a pure intention of doing all things to please  thee  that so i may open it to thee  and with gentle violence compel thee  to come in  that thou  o lord  mayest work therein without resistance all  those effects which from all eternity thou hast desired to produce in  me       he lingered a little on the words  his face buried in his hands  then  slowly he turned back to an earlier page        man must use creatures as being in themselves indifferent  he must not  be under their power  but use them for his own purpose  his own first and  chiefest purpose  the salvation of his soul       a shudder passed through him  he rose hastily from his seat  and began to  pace the room  he had already passed through a wrestle of the same kind   and had gone away to fight down temptation  to night the struggle was  harder  the waves of rising passion broke through him      little pale  angry face  i gave her a scolding like a child  what joy to  have forgiven her like a child   to have asked her pardon in return  to  have felt the soft head against my breast  she was very fierce with  me  she hates me  i suppose  and yet  she is not indifferent to me   she  knows when i am there  downstairs she was conscious of me all through  i  knew it  her secret was in her face  i guessed it  foolish child  from  the first moment  strange  stormy nature   i see it all  her passion for  her father  and for these peasants as belonging to him  her hatred of me  and of our faith  because her father hated us  her feeling for  augustina  that rigid sense  of obligation she has  just on the two or  three points  points of natural affection  it is this sense  perhaps   that makes the soul of her struggle with this house  with me  how she  loathes all that we love  humility  patience  obedience  she would sooner  die than obey  unless she loved  then what an art  what an enchantment to  command her  it would tax a lover s power  a lover s heart  to the  utmost  ah      he stood still  and with an effort of iron resolution put from him the  fancies that were thronging on the brain  if it were possible for him to  conquer her  conceivable that he might win her  such a dream was  forbidden to him  alan helbeck  a thousandfold  such a marriage would be  the destruction of innumerable schemes for the good of the church  for  the perfecting of his own life  it would be the betrayal of great trusts   the abandonment of great opportunities   my life would centre in her  she  would come first  the church second  her nature would work on mine  not  mine on hers  could i ever speak to her even of what i believe   the very  alphabet of it is unknown to her  i shrink from proselytism  god forgive  me   it is her wild pagan self that i love  that i desire         the blast of human longing  human pain  was hard to meet  hard to subdue   but the catholic

frowns on such a love  such marriages  she does  not forbid them  but they pain her heart  i have accepted her judgment  till now  without difficulty  without conflict  now to obey is hard  but  i can obey  we are not asked impossibilities      he walked to the crucifix  and threw himself down before it  a midnight  stillness brooded over the house                                                 but far away  in an upper room  laura fountain had cried herself to  sleep  only to wake again and again  with the tears flooding her cheeks   was it merely a disagreeable and exciting scene she had gone through   what was this new invasion of her life   this new presence to the inward  eye of a form and look that at once drew her and repulsed her  a hundred  alien forces were threatening and pressing upon her  and out from the  very heart of them came this strange drawing  this magnetism  this  troubling misery     to be prisoned in bannisdale  under mr  helbeck s roof  for months and  months longer  this thought was maddening to her     but when she imagined herself free to go  and far away once more from  this old and melancholy house  among congenial friends and scenes  she  was no happier than before  a little moan of anger and pain came  that  she stifled against her pillow  calling passionately on the sleep that  would  that must  chase all these phantoms of fatigue or excitement  and  give her back her old free self           book iii          chapter i     we shall get there in capital time  that s nice   said polly mason   putting down the little railway guide she had just purchased at marsland  station  with a general rustle of satisfaction     polly indeed shone with good temper and new clothes  her fringe  even  halved  was prodigious  her cheap lemon coloured gloves were cracking on  her large hands  and round her beflowered hat she had tied clouds on  clouds of white tulle  which to some extent softened the tans and  crimsons of her complexion  her dress was of a stiff white cotton stuff   that fell into the most startling folds and angles  and at every movement  of it  the starch rattled     on the opposite seat of the railway carriage was laura fountain  an open  book upon her knee that she was not reading  she made no answer  however   to polly s remark  the impression left by her attitude was that she took  no interest in it  miss fountain herself hardly seemed to have profited  much by that westmoreland air whereof the qualities were to do so much  for augustina  it was now june  the end of june  and laura was certainly  paler  less blooming  than she had been in march  she seemed more  conscious  she was certainly less radiant  whether her prettiness had  gained by the slight change  might be debated  polly s eyes  indeed  as  they sped along  paid her cousin one long covetous tribute  the  difficulty that she always had in putting on her own clothes  and  softening her own physical points  made her the more conscious of laura s  delicate ease  of all the yielding and graceful lines into which the  little black and white muslin frock fell so readily  of all that natural  kinship between laura and her hats  laura and her gloves  which poor  polly fully perceived  knowing well and sadly that she herself could  never attain to it     nevertheless  pretty  miss fountain might be  elegant she certainly was   but polly did not find her the best of companions for a festal day  they  were going to froswick  the big town on the coast  to meet hubert and  another young man  one mr  seaton  foreman in a large engineering  concern  whose name polly had not been able to mention without bridling   for some time past     it was more than a fortnight since the sister  driven by hubert s  incessant letters  had proposed to laura that they two should spend a  summer day at froswick and see the great steel works on which the fame of  that place depended  escorted and entertained by the two young men  laura  at first had turned a deaf ear  then all at once  a very flare of  eagerness and acceptance   a sudden choosing of day and train  and now  that they were actually on their way  with everything arranged  and a  glorious june sun above their heads  laura was so silent  so reluctant   so irritable  you might have thought        well   polly really did not know what to think  she was not quite happy  herself  from time to time  as her look dwelt on laura  she was conscious  of certain guilty reserves and concealments in her own breast  she wished  hubert had more sense  she hoped to goodness it would all go off nicely   but of course it would  polly was an optimist and took all things simply   her anxieties for laura did not long resist the mere pleasure of the  journey and the trip  the flatteries of expectation  what a very  respectable and  on the whole  good looking young man was mr  seaton   polly had met him first at the browhead dance  so that what was a mere  black and ugly spot in laura s memory shone rosy red in her cousin s     meanwhile laura  mainly to avoid polly s conversation  was looking hard  out of window  they were running along the southern shore of a great  estuary  behind the loitering train rose the hills they had just left   the hills that sheltered the stream and the woods of bannisdale  that  rich  dark patch beneath the further brow was the wood in which the house  stood  to the north  across the bay  ran the line of high mountains  a  dim paradise of sunny slopes and steeps  under the keenest and brightest  of skies  blue ramparts from which the gently opening valleys flowed  downwards  one beside the other  to the estuary and the sea     not that the great plunging sea itself was much to be seen as yet   immediately beyond the railway line stretched leagues of firm reddish  sand  pierced by the innumerable channels of the greet  the sun lay hot  and dazzling on the wide flat surfaces  on the flocks of gulls  on the  pools of clear water  the window was open  and through the june heat  swept a sharp  salt breath  laura  however  felt none of the physical  exhilaration that as a rule overflowed in her so readily  was it because  the bannisdale woods were still visible  what made the significance of  that dark patch to the girl s restless eye  she came back to it again and  again  it was like a flag  round which a hundred warring thoughts had  come to gather     why     were not she and mr  helbeck on the best of terms  was not augustina  quite pleased  quite content   i always knew  my dear laura  that you and  alan would get on  in time  why  anyone could get on with alan  he s so  kind   when these things were said  laura generally laughed  she did not  remind mrs  fountain that she  at one time of her existence  had not  found it particularly easy and simple to  get on with alan   but the girl  did once allow herself the retort   it s not so easy to quarrel  is it   when you don t see a person from week s end to week s end    week s end  to week s end   mrs  fountain repeated vaguely   yes  alan is away a  great deal  people trust him so much  he has so much business      laura was of opinion that his first business might very well have been to  see a little more of his widowed sister  she and augustina spent days and  days alone  while mr  helbeck pursued the affairs of the church  one  precious attempt indeed had been made to break the dulness of bannisdale   miss fountain s cheeks burned when she thought of it  there had been an  afternoon party  though augustina s widowhood was barely a year old  mrs   fountain had been sent about the country delivering notes and cards  and  the result   oh  such a party   such an interminable afternoon  where had  the people come from   who were they  if polly  full of curiosity  asked  for some details  laura would toss her head and reply that she knew  nothing at all about it  that mrs  denton had provided bad tea and worse  cakes  and the guests had  filled their chairs   and there was nothing  else to say  mr  helbeck s shyness and efforts  the glances of appeal he  threw every now and then towards his sister  his evident depression when  the thing was done  these things were not told to polly  there was a  place for them in the girl s sore mind  but they did not come to speech   anyway she believed  nay  was quite sure  that bannisdale would not be so  tried a second time  for whose benefit was it done   whose     one evening        as the train crossed the bridge of the estuary  from one stretch of hot  sand to another  laura  staring at the view  saw really nothing but an  image of the mind  felt nothing except what came through the magic of  memory     the hall of bannisdale  with the lingering daylight of the north still  coming in at ten o clock through the uncurtained oriel windows  herself  at the piano  augustina on the settle  a scent of night and flowers  spreading through the dim place from the open windows of the drawing room  beyond  one candle is beside her  and there are strange glints of  moonlight here and there on the panelling  a tall figure enters from the  chapel passage  augustina makes room on the settle  the squire leans back  and listens  and the girl at the piano plays  the stillness and the night  seem to lay releasing hands upon her  bonds that have been stifling and  cramping the soul break down  she plays with all her self  as she might  have talked or wept to a friend  to her father     and at last  in a  pause  the squire puts a new candle beside her  and his deep shy voice  commends her  asks her to go on playing  afterwards  there is a pleasant  and gentle talk for half an hour  augustina can hardly be made to go to  bed  and when at last she rises  the girl s small hand slips into the  man s  is lost there  feels a new lingering touch  from which both  withdraw in almost equal haste  and the night  for the girl  is broken  with restlessness  with wild efforts to draw the old fetters tight again   to clamp and prison something that flutters  that struggles     then next morning  there is an empty chair at the breakfast table   the  squire left early on business   without any warning  any courteous  message  one evening at home  after a long absence  and then  off again   a good catholic  it seems  lives in the train  and makes himself the  catspaw of all who wish to use him for their own ends         as to that old peasant  scarsbrook  what could be more arbitrary   more absurd  than mr  helbeck s behaviour  the matter turns out to be  serious  fright blanches the old fellow s beard and hair  he takes to his  bed  and the doctor talks of severe  nervous shock   very serious  often  deadly  at the patient s age  why not confess everything at once  set  things straight  free the poor shaken mind from its oppression  who s  afraid   what harm is there in an after dinner stroll     but there   truth apparently is what no one wants  what no one will  have  least of all  mr  helbeck  she sees a meeting in the park  under  the oaks  the same tall man and the girl  the girl bound impetuously for  confession  and the soothing of old scarsbrook s terrors once for  all  the man standing in the way  as tough and prickly as one of his own  hawthorns  courtesy  of course  there is no one can make courtesy so  galling  and then such a shooting out of will and personality  so sudden   so volcanic a heat of remonstrance  and a woman is such a poor ill strung  creature  even the boldest of them  she yields when she should have  pressed forward  goes home to rage  when she should have stayed to  wrestle     afterwards  another absence  the old house silent as the grave  and  augustina so fretful  so wearisome  but she is better  much better  how  unscrupulous are doctors  and those other persons who make them say  exactly what suits the moment     the dulness seems to grow with the june heat  soon it becomes  intolerable  nobody comes  nobody speaks  no mind offers itself to yours  for confidence and sympathy  well  but change and excitement of some sort  one  must  have   who is to blame  if you get it where you can     a day in froswick with hubert mason  yes  why not  polly proposes it  has  proposed it once or twice before to no purpose  for two months now the  young man has been in training  polly writes to him often  laura  sometimes wonders whether the cross examinations through which polly puts  her may not partly be for hubert s benefit  she herself has written twice  to him in answer to some half dozen letters  has corrected his song for  him  has played altogether a very moral and sisterly part  is the youth  really in love  perhaps  will it do him any harm     augustina of course dislikes the prospect of the froswick day  but   really  augustina must put up with it  the reverend mother will come for  the afternoon  and keep her company  such civility of late on the part of  all the catholic friends of bannisdale towards miss fountain   a civility  always on the watch  week by week  day by day  that never yields itself  for an instant  has never a human impulse  an unguarded tone  father  leadham is there one day  he makes a point of talking with miss fountain   he leads the conversation to cambridge  to her father  his keen glance  upon her all the time  the hidden life of the convert and the mystic  leaping every now and then to the surface  and driven down again by a  will that makes itself felt  even by so cool a listener  as a living  tyrannous thing  developed out of all proportion to  nay at the cruel  expense of  the rest of the personality  yet it is no will of the man s  own  it is the will of his order  of his faith  and why these repeated  stray references to bannisdale  to its owner  to the owner s goings and  comings  they are hardly questions  but they might easily have done the  work of questions had the person addressed been willing  laura laughs to  think of it     ah  well  but discretion to day  discretion to morrow  discretion always   is not the most amusing of diets  how dumb  how tame  has she become   there is no one to fight with  nothing whereon to let loose the  sharp edged words and sayings that lie so close behind the girl s shut  lips  how amazing that one should positively miss those fuller activities  in the chapel that depend on the squire s presence  father bowles says  mass there twice a week  the light still burns before the altar  several  times a day augustina disappears within the heavy doors  but when mr   helbeck is at home  the place becomes  as it were  the strong heart of  the house  it beats through the whole organism  so that no one can ignore  or forget it     what is it that makes the difference when he returns  unwillingly  the  mind shapes its reply  a sense of unity and law comes back into the  house  a hidden dignity and poetry  the squire s black head carries with  it stern reminders  reminders that challenge or provoke  but  he nothing  common does nor mean   and smaller mortals  as the weeks go by  begin to  feel their hot angers and criticisms driven back upon themselves  to  realise the strange persistency and force of the religious life     inhuman force  but force of any kind tends to draw  to conquer  more than  once laura sees herself at night  almost on the steps of the chapel  in  the dark shadows of the passage  following augustina  but she has never  yet mounted the steps  never passed the door  once or twice she has  angrily snatched herself from listening to the distant voice         mr  helbeck makes very little comment on the froswick plan  one swift  involuntary look at breakfast  as who might say   our compact   but there  was no compact  and go she will     and at last all opposition clears away  it must be mr  helbeck who has  silenced augustina  for even she complains no more  trains are looked  out  arrangements are made to fetch polly from a half way village  a fly  is ordered to meet the      train at night  why does one feel a culprit  all through  absurdity  is one to be mewed up all one s life  to throw  over all fun and frolic at mr  helbeck s bidding  mr  helbeck  who now  scarcely sets foot in bannisdale  who seems to have turned his back upon  his own house  since that precise moment when his sister and her  stepdaughter came to inhabit it  never till this year was he restless in  this way  so says mrs  denton  whose temper grows shorter and shorter     oh  as to fun and frolic  the girl yawns as she looks out of window  what  a long hot day it is going to be  and how foolish are all expeditions   all formal pleasures       at marsland  about seven  she supposes  at  froswick  already her thoughts are busy  hungrily busy with the evening   and the return                                                 the train sped along  they passed a little watering place under the steep  wooded hills  a furnace of sun on this hot june day  in winter a soft and  sheltered refuge from the north  further on rose the ruins of a great  cistercian abbey  great ribs and arches of red sandstone  that still  in  ruin  made the soul and beauty of a quiet valley  then a few busy towns  with mills and factories  the fringe of that industrial district which  lies on the southern and western border of the lake country  more wide  valleys sweeping back into blue mountains  a wealth of june leaf and  blossoming tree  and at last docks and buildings  warehouses and  works    a network of spreading railway lines  and all the other signs of an  important and growing town  the train stopped amid a crowd  and polly  hurried to the door      why  hubert   mr  seaton   here we are      she beckoned wildly  and not a few passers by turned to look at the  nodding clouds of tulle      we shall find them  polly  don t shout   said laura behind her  in some  disgust     shout and beckon  however  polly did and would  till the two young men  were finally secured      why  hubert  you never towd me what a big place  twas   said polly  joyously   lor  mr  seaton  doant fash yoursel  this is miss fountain  my  cousin  you ll remember her  i knaw      mr  seaton began a polite and stilted speech while possessing himself of  polly s shawl and bag  he was a very superior young man of the clerk or  foreman type  somewhat ill put together at the waist  with a flat back to  his head  and a cadaverous countenance  laura gave him a rapid look  but  her chief curiosity was for hubert  and at her first glance she saw the  signs of that strong and silent process perpetually going on amongst us  that tames the countryman to the life and habits of the town  it was only  a couple of months since the young athlete from the fells had been  brought within its sway  and already the marks of it were evident in  dress  speech  and manner  the dialect was almost gone  the black sunday  coat was of the most fashionable cut that froswick could provide  and as  they walked along  laura detected more than once in the downcast eyes of  her companion  a stealthy anxiety as to the knees of his new grey  trousers  so far the change was not an embellishment  the first loss of  freedom and rough strength is never that  but it roused the girl s  notice  and a sort of secret sympathy  she too had felt the curb of an  alien life   she could almost have held out her hand to him as to a  comrade in captivity     outside the station  to laura s surprise  considering the object of the  expedition  hubert made a sign to his sister  and they two dropped behind  a little      what s the matter with her   said hubert abruptly  as soon as he judged  that they were out of hearing of the couple in front      who do you mean  laura  why  she s well enoof       then she don t look it  she s fretting  what s wrong with her      as hubert looked down upon his sister  polly was startled by the  impatient annoyance of look and manner  and how red rimmed and weary were  the lad s eyes  you might have thought he had not slept for a week   polly s mind ran through a series of conjectures  and she broke out with  westmoreland plainness       hubert  i do wish tha wouldn t be sich a fool  i ve towd tha so times  and times       aye  and you may tell me so till kingdom come  i shan t mind you   he  said doggedly   there s something between her and the squire  i know  there is  i know it by the look of her      polly laughed      how you jump  i tell tha she never says a word aboot him      hubert looked moodily at laura s little figure in front      all the more reason   he said between his teeth   she d talk about him  when she first came  but i ll find out  never fear       for goodness  sake  hubert  let her be   said polly  entreating   sich  wild stuff as thoo s been writin me  yan might ha thowt yo d be fer  cuttin yor throat  if yo  didn t get her doon here   what art tha thinkin  of  lad  she ll never marry tha  she doan t belong to us  and there s noa  undoin it      hubert made no reply  but unconsciously his muscular frame took a  passionate rigidity  his face became set and obstinate      well  you keep watch   he said   you ll see  i ll make it worth your  while      polly looked up  half laughing  she understood his reference to herself  and her new sweetheart  hubert would play her game if she would play his   well  she had no objection whatever to help him to the sight of laura  when she could  polly s moral sense was not over delicate  and as to the  upshot and issues of things  her imagination moved but slowly  she did  not like to let herself think of what might have been hubert s relations  to women  to one or two wild girls about whinthorpe for instance  but  laura  laura who was so much their social better  whose manners and  self possession awed them both  what smallest harm could ever come to her  from any act or word of hubert s  for this rustic westmoreland girl   laura fountain stood on a pedestal robed and sceptred like a little  queen  hubert was a fool to fret himself  a fool to go courting some one  too high for him  what else was there to say or think about it     at the next street corner laura made a resolute stop  polly should not  any longer be defrauded of her mr  seaton  besides she  laura  wished to  talk to hubert  mr  beaton s long words  and way of mouthing his highly  correct phrases  had already seemed to take the savour out of the  morning     when the exchange was made  mr  seaton alas  showing less eagerness than  might have been expected  laura quietly examined her companion  it seemed  to her that he was taller than ever  surely she was not much higher than  his elbow  hubert  conscious that he was being scrutinised  turned red   looked away  coughed  and apparently could find nothing to say      well  how are you getting on   said the light voice  sending its  vibration through all the man s strong frame      i suppose i m getting on all right   he said  switching at the railings  beside the road with his stick      what sort of work do you do      he gave her a stumbling account  from which she gathered that he was for  the time being the factotum of an office  sent on everybody s errands   and made responsible for everybody s shortcomings     she threw him a glance of pity  this young hercules  with his open air  traditions  and his athlete s triumphs behind him  turned into the butt  and underling of half a dozen clerks in a stuffy office      i don t mind   he said hastily   all the others paid for their places  i  didn t pay for mine  i ll be even with them all some day  it was the  chance i wanted  and my uncle gives me a lift now and then  it was to  please him they gave me the berth  he s worth thousands and thousands a  year to them      and he launched into a boasting account of the importance and abilities  of his uncle  daniel mason  who was now managing director of the great  shipbuilding yard into which hubert had been taken  as a favour to his  kinsman      he began at the bottom  same as me  only he was younger than me   said  hubert   so he had the pull  but you ll see  i ll work up  i ve learnt a  lot since i ve been here  the classes at the institute  well  they re  fine      laura showed an astonished glance  new sides of the lad seemed to be  revealing themselves     she inquired after his music  but he declared he was too busy to think of  it  by and by in the winter he would have lessons  there was a violin  class at the institute  perhaps he d join that  then abruptly  staring  down upon her with his wide blue eyes       and how have you been getting on with the squire      he thought she started  but couldn t be quite sure      getting on with the squire  why  capitally  whenever he s there to get  on with       what  he s been away   he said eagerly     she raised her shoulders      he s always away          why  i thought they d have made a papist of you by now   he said     his laugh was rough  but his eyes held her with a curious insistence      think something more reasonable  please  next time  now  where are we  going to lunch       we ve got it all ready  but we must see the yard first     miss  fountain  laura  i ve got that flower you gave me      his voice was suddenly hoarse     she glanced at him  lifting her eyebrows      very foolish of you  i m sure     now do tell me  how did you get off so  early      he sulkily explained to her that work was unusually slack in his own  yard  that  moreover  he had worked special overtime during the week in  order to get an hour or two off this saturday  and that seaton was on  night duty at a large engineering  works   and lord therefore of his  days  but she paid small attention  she was occupied in looking at the  new buildings and streets  the brand new squares and statues of froswick      how can people build and live in such ugly places   she said at last   standing still that she might stare about her   when there are such  lovely things in the world  cambridge  for instance  or  bannisdale      the last word slipped out  dreamily  unaware     the lad s face flushed furiously      i don t know what there is to see in bannisdale   he said hotly   it s a  damp  dark  beastly hole of a place       i prefer bannisdale to this  thank you   said laura  making a little  face at the very ample bronze gentleman in a frock coat who was standing  in the centre of a great new built empty square  haranguing a phantom  crowd   oh  how ugly it is to succeed  to have money      mason looked at her with a half puzzled frown  a frown that of late had  begun to tease his handsome forehead habitually      what s the harm of having a bit of brass   he said angrily   and what s  the beauty o  livin in an old ramshackle place  without a sixpence in  your pocket  and a pride fit to bring you to the workhouse      laura s little mouth showed amusement  an amusement that stung  she  lifted a little fan that hung at her girdle      is there any shade in froswick   she said  looking round her     mason was silenced  and as polly and mr  seaton joined them  he recovered  his temper with a mighty effort and once more set himself to do the  honours  the slighted honours  of his new home         but oh  the heat of the ship building yard  laura was already tired  and faint  and could hardly drag her feet up and down the sides of the  great skeleton ships that lay building in the docks  or through the  interminable  fitting  sheds with their piles of mahogany and teak  their  whirring lathes and saws  their heaps of shavings  their resinous wood  smell  and yet the managing director appeared in person for twenty  minutes  a thin  small  hawk eyed man  not at all unwilling to give a  brief patronage to the young lady who might be said to link the houses of  mason and helbeck in a flattering equality      he wad never ha doon it for  us    polly whispered in her awe to miss  fountain   it s you he s affther      laura  however  was not grateful  she took her industrial lesson ill   with much haste and inattention  so that once when the director and his  nephew fell behind  the great man  whose speech to his kinsman in private  was often little less broad than mrs  mason s own  said scornfully      an i doan t think much o  your fine cousin  mon  she s nobbut a flighty  miss      the young man said nothing  he was still slavishly ill at ease with his  uncle  on whose benevolence all his future depended      is there something more to see   said laura languidly      only the steel works   said mr  seaton  with a patronising smile   you  young ladies  i presume  would hardly wish to go away without seeing our  chief establishment  froswick steel and hematite works employ three  thousand workmen       do they   and does it matter   said laura  playing with the salt     she wore a little plaintive  tired air  which suited her soft paleness   and made her extraordinarily engaging in the eyes of both the young men   mason watched her perpetually  anticipating her slightest movement   waiting on her least want  and mr  seaton  usually so certain of his own  emotions and so wholly in command of them  began to feel himself  confused  it was with a distinct slackening of ardour that he looked from  miss fountain to polly  his polly  as he had almost come to think of her   honest managing polly  who would have a bit of  brass   and was in all  respects a tidy and suitable wife for such a man as he  but why had she  wrapped all that silly white stuff round her head  and her hands   mr   seaton slyly withdrew his eyes from polly s reddened members to fix them  on the thin white wrist that laura was holding poised in air  and the  pretty fingers twirling the salt spoon     polly meantime sat up very straight  and was no longer talkative  lunch  had not improved her complexion  as the mirror hanging opposite showed  her  every now and then she too threw little restless glances across at  laura      why  we needn t go to the works at all if we don t like   said polly    can t we get a fly  hubert  and take a jaunt soomwhere      hubert bent forward with alacrity  of course they could  if they went  four miles up the river or so  they would come to real nice country and a  farmhouse where they could have tea      well  i m game   said mr  seaton  magnanimously slapping his pocket    anything to please these ladies       i don t know about that seven o clock train   said mason doubtfully      well  if we can t get that  there s a later one       no  that s the last       you may trust me   said seaton pompously   i know my way about a railway  guide  there s one a little after eight      hubert shook his head  he thought seaton was mistaken  but laura settled  the matter      thank you  we ll not miss our train   she said  rising to put her hat  straight before the glass   so it s the works  please  what is  it  furnaces and red hot things      in another minute or two they were in the street again  mr  seaton  settled the bill with a magnificent  damn the expense  air  which annoyed  mason  who was of course a partner in all the charges of the day  and  made laura bite her lip  outside he showed a strong desire to walk with  miss fountain that he might instruct her in the details of the bessemer  process and the manufacture of steel rails  but the ease with which the  little nonchalant creature disposed of him  the rapidity with which he  found himself transferred to polly  and left to stare at the backs of  laura and hubert hurrying along in front  amazed him      isn t she nice looking   said poor polly  as she too stared helplessly  at the distant pair     her shawl weighed upon her arm  mr  seaton had forgotten to ask for it   but there was a little sudden balm in the irritable vexation of his  reply      some people may be of that opinion  miss mason  i own i prefer a greater  degree of balance in the fair sex       oh  does he mean me   thought polly     and her spirits revived a little                                                 meanwhile  as laura and hubert walked along to the desolate road that led  to the great steel works  hubert knew a kind of jealous and tormented  bliss  she was there  fluttering beside him  her delicate face often  turned to him  her feet keeping step with his  and at the same time what  strong intangible barriers between them  she had put away her mocking  tone  was clearly determined to be kind and cousinly  yet every word only  set the tides of love and misery swelling more strongly in the lad s  breast   she doan t belong to us  an there s noa undoin it   polly s  phrase haunted his ear  yet he dared ask her no more questions about  helbeck  small and frail as she was  she could wrap herself in an  unapproachable dignity  nobody had ever yet solved the mystery of laura s  inmost feeling against her will  and hubert knew despairingly that his  clumsy methods had small chance with her  but he felt with a kind of rage  that there were signs of suffering about her  he divined something to  know  at the same time that he realised with all plainness it was not for  his knowing  ah  that man  that ugly starched hypocrite  after all had he  got hold of her  who could live near her without feeling this pain  this  pang     was she to be surrendered to him without a struggle  to that  canting  droning fellow  with his jail of a house  why  he would crush  the life out of her in six months     there was a rush and whirl in the lad s senses  a cry of animal  jealousy  of violence  rose in his being                                                  how wonderful   how enchanting   cried laura  her glance sparkling  her  whole frame quivering with pleasure     they had just entered the great main shed of the steel works  the  foreman  who had been induced by the young men to take them through  was  in the act of placing laura in the shelter of a brick screen  so as to  protect her from a glowing shower of sparks that would otherwise have  swept over her  and the girl had thrown a few startled looks around her     a vast shed  much of it in darkness  and crowded with dim forms of iron  and brick  at one end  and one side  openings  where the june day came  through  within  a grandiose mingling of fire and shadow  a vast glare of  white or bluish flame from a huge furnace roaring against the inner wall  of the shed  sparks  like star showers  whirling through dark  spaces  ingots of glowing steel  pillars of pure fire passing and  repassing  so that the heat of them scorched the girl s shrinking  cheek  and everywhere  dark against flame  the human movement answering  to the elemental leap and rush of the fire  black forms of men in a  constant activity  masters and ministers at once of this crackling terror  round about them      aye   said their guide  answering the girl s questions as well as he  could in the roar   that s the great furnace where they boil the steel   now you watch  when the flame  look  it s white now  turns blue  that  means the process is done  the steel s cooked  then they ll bring the vat  beneath  turn the furnace over  you ll see the steel pour out       is that a railway      she pointed to a raised platform in front of the furnace  a truck bearing  a high metal tub was running along it      yes  it s from there they feed the furnace  in a minute you ll see the  tub tip over      there was a signal bell  a rattle of machinery  the tub tilted  a great  jet of white flame shot upwards from the furnace  the great mouth had  swallowed down its prey      and those men with their wheelbarrows  why do they let them go so  close      she shuddered and put her hand over her eyes     the foreman laughed      why  it s quite safe   the tub s moved out of the way  you see the  furnace has to be fed with different stuffs   the tub brings one sort and  the barrows another  now look  they re going to turn it over  stand  back      he held up his hand to bid mason come under shelter     laura looked round her      where are the other two   she asked      oh  they ve gone to see the bar testing  they ll be here soon  seaton  knows the man in charge of the testing workshop      laura ceased to think of them  she was absorbed in the act before her   the great lip of the furnace began to swing downwards  fresh showers of  sparks fled in wild curves and spirals through the shed  out flowed the  stream of liquid steel into the vat placed beneath  then slowly the fire  cup righted itself  the flame roared once more against the wall  the  swarming figures to either side began once more to feed the monster  men  and trucks and wheelbarrow  the little railway line  and the iron pillars  supporting it  all black against the glare        laura stood breathless  her wild nature rapt by what she saw  but while  she hung on the spectacle before her  mason never spared it a glance  he  was conscious of scarcely anything but her  her childish form  in the  little clinging dress  her white face  every soft feature clear in the  glow  her dancing eyes  her cloud of reddish hair  from which her wide  black hat had slipped away in the excitement of her upward gaze  the lad  took the image into his heart  it burnt there as though it too were fire      now let s look at something else   said laura at last  turning away with  a long breath     and they took her to see the vat that had been filled from the furnace   pouring itself into the ingot moulds  then the four moulds travelling  slowly onwards till they paused under a sort of iron hand that descended  and lifted them majestically from the white hot steel beneath  uncovering  the four fiery pillars that reddened to a blood colour as they moved  across the shed  till  on the other side  one ingot after another was  lowered from the truck  and no sooner felt the ground than it became the  prey of some unseen force  which drove it swiftly onwards from beneath   to where it leapt with a hiss and crunch into the jaws of the mill  then  out again on the further side  lengthened  and pared  the demon in it  already half tamed   flying as it were from the first mill  only to be  caught again in the squeeze of the second  and the third  until at last  the quivering rail emerged at the further end  a twisting fire serpent   still soft under the controlling rods of the workmen  on it glided  on   and out of the shed  into the open air  till it reached a sort of  platform over a pit  where iron claws caught at it from beneath  and  brought it to a final rest  in its own place  beside its innumerable  fellows  waiting for the market and its buyers      mayn t we go back once more to the furnace   said miss fountain eagerly  to her guide   just for a minute      he smiled at her  unable to say no     and they walked back across the shed  to the brick shelter  the great  furnace was roaring as before  the white sheet of flame was nearing its  last change of colour  tub after tub  barrow after barrow poured its  contents into the vast flaring throat  behind the shelter was an elderly  woman with a shawl over her head  she had brought a jar of tea for some  workmen  and was standing like any stranger  watching the furnace and  hiding from the sparks     now there is only one man more  and after that  one more tub to be  lowered  and the hell broth is cooked once again  and will come streaming  forth     the man advances with his barrow  laura sees his blackened face in the  intolerable light  as he turns to give a signal to those behind him  an  electric bell rings     then        what was that     god   what was that     a hideous cry rang through the works  laura drew her hand in bewilderment  across her eyes  the foreman beside her shouted and ran forward      where s the man   she said helplessly to mason     but mason made no answer  he was clinging to the brick wall  his eyes  staring out of his head  a great clamour rose from the little  railway  from beneath it  from all sides of it  the shed began to swarm  with running men  all hurrying towards the furnace  the air was full of  their cries  it was like the loosing of a maddened hive     laura tottered  fell back against the wall  the old woman who had come to  bring the tea rushed up to her      oh  lord  save us   lord  save us   she cried  with a wail to rend the  heart     and the two women fell into each other s arms  shuddering  with wild  broken words  which neither of them heard or knew       end of vol  i                    me to go  for  as they all said  on account of sister  bobbet s fallin  on the apple parin  we could not go on with the work  of paperin  the meetin  house  and so the interests of zion wouldn t  languish on account of my absence for a day or two any way  and  as the  female sisters all said  it seemed as if the work i wuz called to in  loontown wuz a fair and square case of duty  so they all counselled  me to go  every one on  em  though  as wuz nateral  there wuz severel  divisions of opinions as to the road i should take a goin  there  what  day i should come back  what remiedies wuz best for me to recommend  when i got there  what dress i should wear  and whether i should wear  a hankerchif pin or not  or a bib apron  or a plain banded one  etc    etc   etc   etc     but  as i sez  as to my goin  they wuz every one on  em unanimus  they  meen well  those sisters in the meetin  house do  every one on  em     josiah acted real offish at first about goin   and he laid the case  before the male brothers of the meetin  house  for josiah wuz fearful  that the interests of the buzz saw mill would languish in his absence   one or two of the weaker brethren joined in with him  and talked kinder  deprestin  about it     but deacon sypher and deacon henzy said they would guard his interests  with eagle visions  or somethin  to that effect  and they counselled  josiah warmly that it wuz his duty to go     we hearn afterwards that deacon sypher and deacon henzy wanted to go  into the north woods a fishin  and a huntin  for   or   days  and it has  always been spozed by me that that accounted for their religeus advice  to josiah allen     howsumever  i don t  know  that  but i do know that they started off  a fishin  the very day we left for loontown  and that they come back  home about the time we did  with two long strings of trout      illustration  the return of the hunters      and there wuz them that said that they ketched the trout  and them that  said they bought  em     and they brung back the antlers of a deer in their game bags  and some  bones of a elk  and there are them that sez that they dassent  either  one of  em  shoot off a gun  not hardly a pop gun  but i don t know the  truth of this  i know what they  said   they  said  the huntin  wuz  excitin  to the last degree  and the fishin  superb     and there wuz them that said that they should think the huntin  would be  excitin   a rummagin  round on the ground for some old bones  and they  should think the fishin  would be superb  a dippin   em out of a barell  and stringin   em onto their own strings     but their stories are very large  that i know  and each one on  em   accordin  to their tell  ketched more trouts than the other one  and fur  bigger ones  and shot more deers     wall  deacon sypher ses advice and deacon henzy s influenced josiah a  good deal  and i said quite a few words to him on the subject  and   suffice it to say  that the next day  about    a m   we set out on our  journey to loontown      illustration   miss timson and rosy seemed dretful glad to see me       miss timson and rosy seemed dretful glad to see me  but they wuz pale  and wan  wanner fur than i expected to see  em  but after i had been  there a spell i see how it wuz  i see that ralph wuz their hero as well  as their love  and they worshipped him in every way  with their hearts  and their souls and their idealized fancies     wall  he wuz a noble lookin  man as i ever see  fur or near  and as good  a one as they make  he wuz strong and tender  so i couldn t blame  em     and though i wouldn t want josiah to hear me say too much about it  or  mebby it would be best that he shouldn t  before i had been there     hours i begun to feel some as they did     but my feelin s wuz strictly in a meetin  house sense  strictly     but i begun to feel with them that the middle of the world wuz there in  that bedroom  and the still  white figure a layin  there wuz the centre   and the rest of the world wuz a revolvin  round him     his face wuz worn and marked by the hand of time and endeaver  but every  mark wuz a good one  the soul  which is the best sculptor after all   had chiselled into his features the marks of a deathless endeavor and  struggle toward goodness  which is god  had marked it with the divine  sweetness and passion of livin  and toilin  for the good of others     he had gi n his life jest as truly to seek and save them that wuz lost  as ever any old prophet and martyr ever had sense the world began  but  under all these heavenly expressions that a keen eye could trace in his  good lookin  face  could be seen a deathly weakness  the consumin  fire  that wuz a consumin  of him     miss timson wept when she see me  and rosy threw herself into my arms  and sobbed  but i gently ondid her arms from round my neck and give miss  timson to understand that i wuz there to  help   em if i could      for   sez i softly   the hull future time is left for us to weep in   but the present wuz the time to try to help ralph s  robinson      wall  i laid to  josiah a helpin  me nobly  a pickin  burdock leaves  or beet leaves  as the case might be  and a standin  by me nobly all  through the follerin  night  that is  when he wuz awake      josiah and i took care on him all that night  miss timson refusin  to  give him into the charge of underlin s  and we a offerin  and not to be  refused     wall  josiah slept some  or that is  i s poze he did  i didn t hear much  from him from    p m  to   a m   only once i heard him murmer in his  sleep   buzz saw mill       illustration   didn t see how folks needed so much sleep       but every time i would come out into the settin  room where he sot and  roust him up to get sunthin  for me  he would say  almost warmly       samantha  that last remark of your n wuz very powerful   and i wouldn t  waste my time nor hisen by tellin  him that i hadn t made no remark  nor  thought on t  i see it would hurt his feelin s  specilly as he would add  in haste       that he didn t see how folks needed so much sleep  as for him  it wuz a  real treat to keep awake all night  now and then      no  i would let it go  and ask him for burdock or beet  as the case  might be  truly i had enugh on my mind and heart that night without  disputin  with my josiah     ralph s  robinson would lay lookin  like a dead man some of the time   still and demute  and then he would speak out in a strange language   stranger than any i ever heard  he would preach sermons in that  language  i a knowin  it wuz a sermen by his gestures  and also by my  feelin s  and then he would shet up his eyes and pray in that strange   strange tongue  and anon breakin  out into our own language  and once he  said      and now may the peace of god be with you all  amen  the peace of god   the peace  the peace      his voice lingered sort o  lovin ly over that word  and i felt that he  wuz a thinkin  then of the real peace  the onbroken stillness  outside  and inside  that he invoked     rosy would steal in now and then like a sweet little shadow  and bend  down and kiss her pa  and cry a little over his thin  white hands which  wuz a lyin  on the coverlet  or else lifted in that strange speech that  sounded so curius to us  a risin  up out of the stillness of a loontown  spare bedroom on a calm moonlit evenin      wall  friday and saturday he wuz crazier n a loon  more n half the time  he wuz  but along saturday afternoon the doctor told us that the fever  would turn sometime the latter part of the night  and if he could sleep  then  and not be disturbed  there would be a chance for his life     wall  miss timson and rosy both told me how the ringin  of the bells  seemed to roust him up and skair him  as it were  and git him all  excited and crazy  and they both wuz dretful anxius about the mornin   bells which would ring when ralph would mebby be sleepin   so thinkin   it wuz a case of life and death  and findin  out who wuz the one to  tackle in the matter  i calmly tied on my bonnet and walked over and  tackled him           chapter xxiv       it wuz deacon garven and he wuz a close communion baptist by  perswaision  and a good man  so fur as firm morals and a sound creed  goes     some things he lacked  he hadn t no immagination at all  not one speck   and in makin  him up  it seems as if he had a leetle more justice added  to him to make up a lack of charity and pity  and he had a good deal  of sternness and resolve gin him  to make up  i spoze  for a lack of  tenderness and sweetness of nater     a good sound man deacon garven wuz  a man who would cheat himself before  he would cheat a neighber  he wuz jest full of qualities that would  hender him from ever takin  a front part in a scandel and a tragedy   yes  if more men wuz like deacon garven the pages of the daily papers  would fairly suffer for rapiners  embezzlers  wife whippers  etc     wall  he wuz in his office when i tackled him  the hired girl asked me  if i come for visitin  purposes or business  and i told her firmly    business      so she walked me into a little office one side of the hall  where i  spoze the deacon transacted the business that come up on his farm  and  then he wuz justice of the peace  and trustee of varius concerns  every  one of  em good ones      he is a tall  bony man  with eyes a sort of a steel gray  and thin lips  ruther wide  and settin  close together  and without lookin  like one   or  that is  without havin  the same features at all  the deacon did  make me think of a steel trap  i spoze it wuz because he wuz so sound   and sort o  firm  a steel trap is real firm when it lays hold and tries  to be      illustration   the deacon did make me think of a steel trap       wall  i begun the subject carefully  but straight to the pint  as my way  is  by tellin  him that ralph s  robinson wuz a layin  at death s door   and his life depended on his gettin  sleep  and we wuz afraid the bells  in the mornin  would roust him up   and i had come to see if he would  omit the ringin  of  em in the mornin       not ring the bells   sez he  in wild amaze   not ring the church bells  on the sabbath day      his look wuz skairful in the extreme  but i sez       yes  that is what i said  we beg of you as a christian to not ring the  bells in the mornin        a christian  a christian  advise me as a  christian  to not ring the  sabbath bells      i see the idee skairt him  he wuz fairly pale with surprise and borrow   and i told him agin   puttin  in all the perticilers it needed to make  the story straight and good  how ralph s  robinson had labored for  the good of others  and how his strength had gin out  and he wuz now  a layin  at the very pint of death  and how his girl and his sister wuz  a breakin  their hearts over him  and how we had some hopes of savin   his life if he could get some sleep  that the doctors said his life  depended on it  and agin i begged him to do what we asked     but the deacon had begin to get over bein  skairt  and he looked firm as  anybody ever could  as he sez   the bells never hurt anybody  i know   for here i have lived right by the side of  em for    years  do i look  broke down and weak   sez he      no   sez i  honestly   no more than a grannit monument  or a steel  trap       wall   sez he   what don t hurt me won t hurt nobody else       but   sez i   folks are made up different   sez i   the bible sez so   and what might not hurt you  might be the ruin of somebody else  wuz you  ever nervous   sez i      never   sez he  and he added firmly   i don t believe in nerves  i  never did  there hain t no use in  m       it wuz a wonder they wuz made  then   sez i   as a generel thing the  lord don t make things there hain t no use on  howsumever   sez i    there hain t no use in disputin  back and forth on a nerve  but any  way  sickness is so fur apart from health  that the conditions of one  state can t be compared to the other  as ralph s  robinson is now  the  sound of the bells  or any other loud noise means torture and agony to  him  and  i am afraid  death  and i wish you would give orders to not  have  em rung in the mornin        are you a professor   sez he      yes   sez i      what perswaision   sez he      methodist episcopal   sez i      and do you  a member of a sister church  which  although it has many  errors  is still a gropin  after the light  do you counsel me to set  aside the sacred and time honored rules of our church  and allow the  sabbath to go by unregarded  have the sanctuary desecrated  the cause  of religion languish  i cannot believe it  think of the widespread  desolation it would cause if  as the late lamented mr  selkirk sung         the sound of the church going bells     these valleys and hills never heard        no church  no sanctuary  no religius observances       why   sez i   that wouldn t hinder folks from goin  to church  folks  seem to get to theatres  lectures  and disolvin  views on time  and  better time than they do to meetin    sez i   in your opinin  it hain t  necessary to beat a drum and sound on a bugle as the salvation army duz   to call folks to meetin   you are dretful hard on them  so i hear       yes  they make a senseless  vulgar  onnecessary racket  disturbin  and  agrivatin  to saint and sinner       but   sez i   they say they do it for the sake of religion       religion hain t to be found in drum sticks   sez he bitterly      no   sez i   nor in a bell clapper       oh   sez he   that is a different thing entirely  that is to call  worshippers together  that is necessary      sez i   one hain t no more necessary than the other in my opinion      sez he   look how fur back in the past the sweet bells have sounded  out       yes   sez i candidly   and in the sweet past they wuz necessary   sez  i   in the sweet past  there wuzn t a clock nor a watch  the houses wuz  fur apart  and they needed bells  but now there hain t a house but what  is runnin  over with clocks  everybody knows the time  they know it so  much that time is fairly a drug to  em  why  they time themselves right  along through the day  from breakfast to midnight  time their meals   their business  their pleasures  their music  their lessons  their  visits  their visitors  their pulse beats  and their dead beats  they  time their joys and their sorrows  and everything and everybody  all  through the week  and why should they stop short off sundays  why not  time themselves on goin  to meetin   they do  and you know it  there  hain t no earthly need of the bells to tell the time to go to meetin    no more than there is to tell the time to put on the tea kettle to get  supper  if folks want to go to meetin  they will get there  bells or no  bells  and if they don t want to go  bells hain t a goin  to get  em  started      take a man with the sunday  world  jest brung in  a layin  on a lounge   with his feet up in a chair  and kinder lazy in the first place  bells  hain t a goin  to start him      and take a woman with her curl papers not took down  and a new religeus  novel in her hand  and a miliner that disapinted her the night before   and bells hain t a goin  to start her  no  the great bell of moscow  won t start  em      illustration   bells hain t a goin  to start him        and take a good christian woman  a widow  for instance  who loves  church work  and has a good handsome christian pasture  who is in  trouble  lost his wife  mebby  or sunthin  else bad  and the lack of  bells hain t a goin  to keep that women back  no  not if there wuzn t a  bell on earth       oh  wall  wavin  off that side of the subject   sez he  i had convinced  him  i know  but he wouldn t own it  for he knew well that if folks  wanted to go they always got there  bells or no bells    but   sez he  wavin  off that side of the subject   the observance is so time honored   so hallowed by tender memories and associations all through the past       don t you  spoze  deacon garven   sez i   that i know every single  emotion them bells can bring to anybody  and felt all those memorys and  associations  i ll bet  or i wouldn t be afraid to bet  if i believed in  bettin   that there hain t a single emotion in the hull line of emotions  that the sound of them bells can wake up  but what i have felt  and felt   em deep too  jest as deep as anybody ever did  and jest es many of  em   but it is better for me to do without a upliftin   soarin  sort of a  feelin  ruther than have other people suffer agony       agony   sez he   talk about their causin  agony  when there hain t a  more heavenly sound on earth       illustration   a leanin  over the front gate on a still spring  mornin         so it has been to me   sez i candidly   to me they have always sounded  beautiful  heavenly  why   sez i  a lookin  kinder fur off  beyond  deacon garven  and all other troubles  as thoughts of beauty and  insperation come to me borne out of  the past into my very soul  by the  tender memories of the bells  thoughts of the great host of believers  who had gathered together at the sound of the bells  the great army of  the redeemed         some of the host have crossed the flood  and some    are crossin  now      thinks i a lookin  way off in a almost rapped way  and then i sez to  deacon garven in a low soft voice  lower and more softer fur  than i had  used to him      don t i know what it is to stand a leanin  over the front gate on a  still spring mornin   the smell of the lilacs in the air  and the brier  roses  a dew sparklin  on the grass under the maples  and the sunshine  a fleckin  the ground between  em  and the robins a singin  and the  hummin  birds a hoverin  round the honeysuckles at the door  and over  all and through all  and above all clear and sweet  comin  from fur  off a floatin  through the sabbath stillness  the sound of the bells   a bringin  to us sweet sabbath messages of love and joy  bringin   memories too  of other mornin s as fair and sweet  when other ears  listened with us to the sound  other eyes looked out on the summer  beauty  and smiled at the sound of the bells  heavenly emotions  sweet  emotions come to me on the melody of the bells  peaceful thoughts   inspirin  thoughts of the countless multitude that has flocked together  at the sound of the bells  the aged feet  the eager youthful feet  the  children s feet  all  all walkin  to the sound of the bells  thoughts  of the happy youthful feet that set out to walk side by side  at their  ringin  sounds  thoughts of the aged ones grown tired  and goin  to  their long dreamless sleep to their solemn sound  thoughts of the brave  hero s who set out to protect us with their lives while the bells wuz  ringin  out their approval of such deeds  thoughts of how they pealed  out joyfully on their return bearin  the form of peace  thoughts of how  the bells filled the mornin  and evenin  air  havin  throbbed and beat  with every joy and every pain of our life  till they seem a part of us   as it were  and the old world would truly seem lonesome without  em      as i told you  and told you truly  i don t believe there is a single  emotion in the hull line of emotions  fur or near  but what them bells  have rung into my very soul      but such emotions  beautiful and inspirin  though they are  can be  dispensed with better than justice and mercy can  sweet and tender  sentiment is dear to me  truly  near and dear  but mercy and pity and  common sense  have also a powerful grip onto my right arm  and have to  lead me round a good deal of the time      beautiful emotion  when it stands opposed to eternal justice  ort to  step gently aside and let justice have a free road  sentiment is truly  sweet  but any one can get along without it  take it right along through  the year  better than they can without sleep      you see if you can t sleep you must die  while a person can worry along  a good many years without sentiment  or  that is  i have been told they  could  i don t know by experience  for i have always had a real lot of  it  you see my experience has been such that i could keep sentiment and  comfort too  but my mind is such  that i have to think of them that  hain t so fortunate as i am      i have looked at the subject from my own standpoint  and have tried  also to look at it through others  eyes  which is the only way we can  get a clear  straight light on any subject  as for me  as i have said   i would love to hear the sweet  far off sound of the bells a tremblin   gently over the hills to me from jonesville  it sounds sweeter to me  than the voices of the robins and swallers  a comin  home from the south  in the spring of the year  and i would deerly love to have it go on and  on as fur as my own feelins are concerned  but i have got to look at the  subject through the tired eyes  and feel it through the worn out nerves  of others  who are sot down right under the wild clamor of the bells      what comes to me as a heavenly melody freighted full of beautiful  sentiment and holy rapture comes to them as an intolerable agony   a maddenin  discord  that threatens their sanity  that rouses  em up  from their fitful sleep  that murders sleep  the bells to them seem  murderus  strikin  noisily with brazen hands  at their hearts      illustration   tossin  on beds of nervous sufferin         to them tossin  on beds of nervous sufferin   who lay for hours fillin   the stillness with horror  with dread of the bells  where fear and dread  of  em exceed the agony of the clangor of the sound when it comes at  last  long nights full of a wakeful horror and expectency  fur worse  than the realization of their imaginin s  to them the bells are a  instrument of torture jest as tuff to bear as any of the other old thumb  screws and racks that wrung and racked our old   fathers in the name of  religion      i have to think of the great crowd of humanity huddled together right  under the loud clangor of the bells whose time of rest begins when the  sun comes up  who have toiled all night for our comfort and luxury  so  we can have our mornin  papers brought to us with our coffee  so we can  have the telegraphic messages  bringing us good news with our toast   so s we can have some of our dear ones come to us from distant lands in  the morning  i must think of them who protect us through the night so we  can sleep in peace      hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these  our helpers and  benafacters  work all night for our sakes  work and toil  the least we  can do for these is to help  em to the great restorer  sleep  all we  can      some things we can t do  we can t stop the creakin  sounds of the  world s work  the big roar of the wheel of business that rolls through  the week days  can t be oiled into stillness  but sundays they might get  a little rest sunday is the only day of rest for thousands of men and  wimmen  nervous  pale  worn by their week s hard toil      the creakin  of the wheels of traffic are stopped on this day  they  could get a little of the rest they need to carry on the fight of life  to help support wife  child  father  husband  but religeon is too much  for  em  the religeon that the bible declares is mild  peacible  tender   it clangs and bangs and whangs at  em till the day of rest is a torment      now the lord wouldn t approve of this  i know he wouldn t  for he was  always tender and pitiful full of compassion  i called it religeon for  oritory  but it hain t religeon  it is a relict of old barberism who   under the cloak of religeon  whipped quakers and hung prophetic souls   that the secrets of heaven had been revealed to  secrets hidden from the  coarser  more sensual vision      sez deacon garven   i consider the bells as missionarys  they help  spread the gospel       and   sez i  for i waz full of my subject  and kep him down to it all i  could   ralph s  robinson has spread the gospel over acres and acres of  land  and brung in droves and droves of sinners into the fold without  the help of church or steeple  let alone bells  and it seems es if he  ortn t to be tortured to death now by  em       wall   he said   he viewed  em as gospel means  and he couldn t  with  his present views of his duty to the lord  omit  em      sez i   the lord didn t use  em  he got along without  em       wall   he said   it wuz different times now      sez i   the lord  if he wuz here to day  deacon garven  if he had bent  over that form racked with pain and sufferin  and that noise of any kind  is murderous to  he would help him  i know he would  for he wuz good to  the sick  and tender hearted always       wall   i  will help him   sez deacon garven   i will watch  and i will  pray  and i will work for him      sez i   will you promise me not to ring the bells to morrow mornin   if  he gets into any sleep at all durin  the    hours  it is along in the  mornin   and i think if we could keep him asleep  say all the forenoon   there would be a chance for him  will you promise me       wall   sez he kinder meltin  down a little   i will talk with the  bretheren      sez i   promise me  deacon eben garven  before you see  em      sez he   i would  but i am so afraid of bringin  the cause of religeon  into contempt  and i dread meddlin  with the old established rules of  the church      sez i   mercy and justice and pity wuz set up on earth before bells wuz   and i believe it is safe to foller  em      but he wouldn t promise me no further than to talk with the bretheren   and i had to leave him with that promise  as things turned out  afterwuds  i wuz sorry  sorry es a dog that i didn t shet up deacon  garven in his own smoke house  or cause him to be shet  and mount a  guard over him  armed nearly to the teeth with clubs     but i didn t  and i relied some on the bretheren     ralph wuz dretful wild all the forepart of the night  he d lay still for  a few minutes  and then he would get all rousted up  and he would set up  in bed and call out some words in that strange tongue  and he would lift  up his poor weak right arm  strong then in his fever  and preach long  sermons in that same strange curius language  he would preach his sermon  right through  earnest and fervent as any sermon ever wuz  i would know  it by the looks of his face  and then he would sometimes sing a little  in that same singular language  and then he would lay down for a spell     but along towards mornin  i see a change  his fever seemed to abate and  go down some  very gradual  till just about the break of day  he fell  into a troubled sleep  or it wuz a troubled sleep at first  but growin   deeper and more peaceful every minute  and along about eight o clock he  wuz a sleepin  sweet for the first time durin  his sickness  it wuz a  quiet restful sleep  and some drops of presperation and sweat could be  seen on his softened features     we all wuz as still  almost  as if we wuz automatoes  we wuz so afraid  of makin  a speck of noise to disturb him  we kep almost breathless   in our anxiety to keep every mite of noise out of his room  but i did  whisper to rosy in a low still voice       illustration   the lord be praised  we shall pull him through        your father is saved  the lord be praised  we shall pull him through      she jest dropped onto her knees  and laid her head in my lap and cried  and wept  but soft and quiet so s it wouldn t disturb a mice     miss timson wuz a prayin   i could see that  she wuz a returnin  thanks  to the lord for his mercy     as for me  i sot demute  in that hushed and darkened room  a watchin   every shadow of a change that might come to his features  with a  teaspoon ready to my hand  to give him nourishment at the right time if  he needed it  or medicine     when all of a sudden  slam  bang  rush  roar  slam  slam  ding  dong   bang    come right over our heads the wild  deafening clamor of the  bells     ralph started up wilder than ever because of his momentary repose  he  never knew us  nor anything  from that time on  and after sufferin  for  another    hours  sufferin  that made us all willin  to have it stop  he  died     and so he who had devoted his hull life to religeon wuz killed by it   he who had gin his hull life for the true  wuz murdered by the false      illustration   and i thought he wuz pronouncin  a benediction on the  savages       his last move wuz to spread out his hands  and utter a few of them  strange words  as if in benediction over a kneelin  multitude  and i  thought then  and i think still  that he wuz pronouncin  a benediction  on the savages  and i have always hoped that the mercy he besought from  on high at that last hour brought down god s pity and forgiveness on all  benighted savages  and bigoted ones  deacon garven  and the hull on  em           chapter xxv       the very next day after i got home from miss timson ses  we wimmen all  met to the meetin  house agin as usial  for we knew very well that the  very hardest and most arjuous part of our work lay before us     for if it had been hard and tuckerin  to what it seemed the utmost limit  of tucker  to stand up on a lofty barell  and lift up one arm  and  scrape the ceilin   what would it be  so we wildly questioned our souls   and each other  to stand up on the same fearful hites  and lift  both   arms over our heads  and get on them fearful lengths of paper smooth     i declare  when the hull magnitude of the task we had tackled riz before  us  it skairt the hull on us  and nuthin  but our deathless devotion to  the methodist meetin  house  kep us from startin  off to our different  homes on the run     but lovin  it as we did  as the very apples in our eyes  and havin  in  our constant breasts a determinate to paper that meetin  house  or die  in the attempt  we made ready to tackle it      illustration   we had to wait for the paste to bile       yet such wuz the magnitude of the task  and our fearful apprehensions   that after we had looked the ceilin  all over  and examined the  paper  we all sot down  as it were  instinctivly  and had a sort of a  conference meetin   we had to wait for the paste to bile anyway  it wuz  bein  made over the stove in the front entry   and he would lift up his  poor weak right arm  strong then in his fever  and preach long sermons  in that same strange curius language  he would preach his sermon right  through  earnest and fervent as any sermon ever wuz  i would know it by  the looks of his face  and then he would sometimes sing a little in that  same singular language  and then he would lay down for a spell     but along towards mornin  i see a change  his fever seemed to abate and  go down some  very gradual  till just about the break of day  he fell  into a troubled sleep  or it wuz a troubled sleep at first  but growin   deeper and more peaceful every minute  and along about eight o clock he  wuz a sleepin  sweet for the first time durin  his sickness  it wuz a  quiet restful sleep  and some drops of presperation and sweat could be  seen on his softened features      illustration   we all set and laid on our plans  and cut the edges  offen the paper       we all wuz as still  almost  as if we wuz automatoes  we wuz so afraid  of makin  a speck of noise to disturb him  we kep almost breathless  in  our anxiety to keep every mite of noise out of his room  but i did  whisper to rosy in a low still voice  it middlin calm  and miss gowdy  offered to be the one to carry it back to jonesville  and change it that  very afternoon  for we could not afford to buy a new one  and we had the  testimony of as many as twenty one or two pairs of eyes  that the handle  didn t come out by our own carelessness  but by its own inherient  weakness  so we spozed he would swap it  we spozed so  but it wuz  arrainged before we disbanded  the result of our conference   that the  next mornin  we would each one on us bring our offerin s to the fair   and hand  em in to the treasurer  so s she would know in time what to  depend on  and what she had to do with     and we agreed  also the result of our conference  that we would  each  one on us  tell jest how we got the money and things to give to the  fair     and then we disbanded and started off home but i ll bet that each one on  us  in a sort of secret unbeknown way  gin a look on that lofty ceilin    them dangerus barells  and that pile of paper  and groaned a low  melancholy groan all to herself      illustration   the handle come out       i know i did  and i know submit tewksbury did  for i stood close to her  and heard her  but then to be exactly jest  and not a mite underhanded   i ort mebby to say  that her groan may be caused partly by the fact that  that aniversery of hern wuz a drawin  so near  yes  the very next day  wuz the day jest    years ago that samuel danker went away from submit  tewksbury to heathen lands  yes  the next day wuz the one that she  always set the plate on for him  the gilt edged chiny with pink sprigs     but i ll bet that half or three quarters of that low melancholy groan of  her n wuz caused by the hardness of the job that loomed up in front of  us  and the hull of mine wuz     wall  that night josiah allen wuz a feelin  dretful neat  fer he had  sold our sorell colt for a awful big price     it wuz a good colt  its mother wuz took sick when it wuz a few days old   and we had brung it up as a corset  or ruther i did  fer josiah allen  at that time had the rheumatiz to that extent that he couldn t step his  foot on the floor for months  so the care of the corset come on me  most  the hull on it  till it got big enough to run out in the lot and git its  own livin      night after night i used to get up and warm milk for it  when it wuz  very small  for it wuz weakly  and we didn t know as we could winter it      illustration   i would meander out there in a icy night to feed it       we kep it in a little warm shed offen the wood house for quite a spell   but still i used to find it considerable cold when i would meander out  there in a icy night to feed it   but jest as it is always the way with  wimmen  the more care i took on it  the more it needed me and depended  on me  the better i liked it     till i got to likin  it so well that it wuzn t half so hard a job for me  to go out to feed it in the night as it would have been to laid still in  my warm bed and think mebby it wuz cold and hungry     so i would pike out and feed it two or three times a night     that is the nater of wimmen  the weaker it wuz and the humblier it wuz   and the more it needed me  the more i thought on it     and as is the nater of man  josiah allen didn t seem to care so much  about it while it wuz weak and humbly and spindlin      he told me time and agin  that i couldn t save it  and it never would  amount to anythin   and wuzn t nothin  but legs any way  and lots of  other slightin  remarks  and he d call it  horse corset  in a kind of  a light  triflin  way  that wuz apt to gaul a woman when she come back  with icy night gown and frosty toes and fingers  way along in the night      illustration   been out to tend to your  horse corset   have you       he d wake up  a layin  there warm and comfortable on his soft goose  feather piller and say to me    been out to tend to your  horse corset    have you        horse corset    wall  what if it wuz      such language way along in the night  from a warm comfortable pardner to  a cold one  is apt to make some words back and forth     and then he d speak of its legs agin  in the most slightin  terms  and  he d ask me if didn t want its picter took  etc   etc   etc      i believe one thing that ailed josiah allen wuz he didn t want me to  get up and get my feet so cold      but  as i wuz a sayin   though i couldn t deny some of his words  for  truly its legs did seem to be at the least calculation a yard and a half  long  specilly in the night  why they d look fairly pokerish     and though i knew it wuz humbly still i persevered  and at last it  got to thrivin  and growin  fast  and the likelier it grew  and the  stronger  and the handsomer  so josiah allen s likin  for it grew and  increased  till he got to settin  a sight of store by it     and now it wuz a two year old  and he had sold it for two hundred and  fifteen dollars  it wuz spozed it wuz goin  to make a good trotter     wall  seem  he had got such a big price for the colt  and knowin  well  that i wuz the sole cause of its bein  alive at this day  i felt that it  wuz the best time in the hull three hundred and sixty five days of the  year to tackle him for sunthin  to give to the fair  i felt that the  least he could do would be to give me ten or fifteen dollars for it  so  consequently after supper wuz out of the way  and the work done up  i  tackled him             belinda  was handsome  graceful  sprightly  and highly accomplished  her aunt had  endeavoured to teach her that a young lady s chief business is to please  in society  that all her charms and accomplishments should be invariably  subservient to one grand object  the establishing herself in the world          for this  hands  lips  and eyes were put to school       and each instructed feature had its rule      mrs  stanhope did not find belinda such a docile pupil as her other  nieces  for she had been educated chiefly in the country  she had early  been inspired with a taste for domestic pleasures  she was fond of  reading  and disposed to conduct herself with prudence and integrity   her character  however  was yet to be developed by circumstances     mrs  stanhope lived at bath  where she had opportunities of showing  her niece off  as she thought  to advantage  but as her health began  to decline  she could not go out with her as much as she wished  after  manoeuvring with more than her usual art  she succeeded in fastening  belinda upon the fashionable lady delacour for the season  her ladyship  was so much pleased by miss portman s accomplishments and vivacity  as  to invite her to spend the winter with her in london  soon after her  arrival in town  belinda received the following letter from her aunt  stanhope      crescent  bath      after searching every place i could think of  anne found your bracelet  in your dressing table  amongst a heap of odd things  which you  left behind you to be thrown away  i have sent it to you by a young  gentleman  who came to bath  unluckily  the very day you left me  mr   clarence hervey  an acquaintance  and great admirer of my lady delacour   he is really an uncommonly pleasant young man  is highly connected   and has a fine independent fortune  besides  he is a man of wit and  gallantry  quite a connoisseur in female grace and beauty  just the  man to bring a new face into fashion  so  my dear belinda  i make it a  point  look well when he is introduced to you  and remember  what i have  so often told you  that nobody  can  look well without taking some pains  to please      i see  or at least when i went out more than my health will at present  permit  i used to see multitudes of silly girls  seemingly all cut out  upon the same pattern  who frequented public places day after day   and year after year  without any idea farther than that of diverting  themselves  or of obtaining transient admiration  how i have pitied and  despised the giddy creatures  whilst i have observed them playing off  their unmeaning airs  vying with one another in the most  obvious    and consequently the most ridiculous manner  so as to expose themselves  before the very men they would attract  chattering  tittering  and  flirting  full of the present moment  never reflecting upon the future   quite satisfied if they got a partner at a ball  without ever thinking  of a partner for life  i have often asked myself  what is to become  of such girls when they grow old or ugly  or when the public eye grows  tired of them  if they have large fortunes  it is all very well  they  can afford to divert themselves for a season or two  without doubt  they  are sure to be sought after and followed  not by mere danglers  but by  men of suitable views and pretensions  but nothing to my mind can be  more miserable than the situation of a poor girl  who  after spending  not only the interest  but the solid capital of her small fortune in  dress  and frivolous extravagance  fails in her matrimonial expectations   as many do merely from not beginning to speculate in time   she finds  herself at five or six and thirty a burden to her friends  destitute  of the means of rendering herself independent  for the girls i speak  of never think of  learning  to play cards    de trop  in society   yet obliged to hang upon all her acquaintance  who wish her in heaven   because she is unqualified to make the  expected  return for civilities   having no home  i mean no establishment  no house   c  fit for the  reception of company of a certain rank   my dearest belinda  may this  never be your case   you have every possible advantage  my love  no  pains have been spared in your education  and  which is the essential  point  i have taken care that this should be known  so that you have   the name  of being perfectly accomplished  you will also have the name  of being very fashionable  if you go much into public  as doubtless you  will with lady delacour   your own good sense must make you aware  my  dear  that from her ladyship s situation and knowledge of the world   it will always be proper  upon all subjects of conversation  for her to  lead and you to follow  it would be very unfit for a young girl like  you to suffer yourself to stand in competition with lady delacour  whose  high pretensions to wit and beauty are  indisputable   i need say  no more to you upon this subject  my dear  even with your limited  experience  you must have observed how foolish young people offend  those who are the most necessary to their interests  by an imprudent  indulgence of their vanity      lady delacour has an incomparable taste in dress  consult her  my dear   and do not  by an ill judged economy  counteract my views  apropos  i  have no objection to your being presented at court  you will  of  course  have credit with all her ladyship s tradespeople  if you manage  properly  to know how and when to lay out money is highly commendable   for in some situations  people judge of what one can afford by what one  actually spends   i know of no law which compels a young lady to tell  what her age or her fortune may be  you have no occasion for caution yet  on one of these points      i have covered my old carpet with a handsome green baize  and every  stranger who comes to see me  i observe  takes it for granted that i  have a rich carpet under it  say every thing that is proper  in your  best manner  for me to lady delacour      adieu  my dear belinda      yours  very sincerely      selina stanhope          it is sometimes fortunate  that the means which are taken to produce  certain effects upon the mind have a tendency directly opposite to  what is expected  mrs  stanhope s perpetual anxiety about her niece s  appearance  manners  and establishment  had completely worn out  belinda s patience  she had become more insensible to the praises of her  personal charms and accomplishments than young women of her age usually  are  because she had been so much flattered and  shown off   as it is  called  by her match making aunt   yet belinda was fond of amusement   and had imbibed some of mrs  stanhope s prejudices in favour of rank  and fashion  her taste for literature declined in proportion to her  intercourse with the fashionable world  as she did not in this society  perceive the least use in the knowledge that she had acquired  her mind  had never been roused to much reflection  she had in general acted  but as a puppet in the hands of others  to her aunt stanhope she had  hitherto paid unlimited  habitual  blind obedience  but she was more  undesigning  and more free from affectation and coquetry  than could  have been expected  after the course of documenting which she had gone  through  she was charmed with the idea of a visit to lady delacour   whom she thought the most agreeable  no  that is too feeble an  expression  the most fascinating person she had ever beheld  such was  the light in which her ladyship appeared  not only to belinda  but to  all the world  that is to say  all the world of fashion  and she knew of  no other   the newspapers were full of lady delacour s parties  and lady  delacour s dresses  and lady delacour s  bon mots   every thing that her  ladyship said was repeated as witty  every thing that her ladyship wore  was imitated as fashionable  female wit sometimes depends on the  beauty of its possessor for its reputation  and the reign of beauty  is proverbially short  and fashion often capriciously deserts her  favourites  even before nature withers their charms  lady delacour  seemed to be a fortunate exception to these general rules  long after  she had lost the bloom of youth  she continued to be admired as a  fashionable  bel esprit   and long after she had ceased to be a novelty  in society  her company was courted by all the gay  the witty  and the  gallant  to be seen in public with lady delacour  to be a visitor at her  house  were privileges of which numbers were vehemently ambitious  and  belinda portman was congratulated and envied by all her acquaintance   for being admitted as an inmate  how could she avoid thinking herself  singularly fortunate     a short time after her arrival at lady delacour s  belinda began to  see through the thin veil with which politeness covers domestic  misery   abroad  and at home  lady delacour was two different persons   abroad she appeared all life  spirit  and good humour  at home   listless  fretful  and melancholy  she seemed like a spoiled actress off  the stage  over stimulated by applause  and exhausted by the exertions  of supporting a fictitious character   when her house was filled with  well dressed crowds  when it blazed with lights  and resounded with  music and dancing  lady delacour  in the character of mistress of the  revels  shone the soul and spirit of pleasure and frolic  but the  moment the company retired  when the music ceased  and the lights were  extinguishing  the spell was dissolved     she would sometimes walk up and down the empty magnificent saloon   absorbed in thoughts seemingly of the most painful nature     for some days after belinda s arrival in town she heard nothing of lord  delacour  his lady never mentioned his name  except once accidentally   as she was showing miss portman the house  she said   don t open that  door  those are only lord delacour s apartments    the first time  belinda ever saw his lordship  he was dead drunk in the arms of two  footmen  who were carrying him up stairs to his bedchamber  his lady   who was just returned from ranelagh  passed by him on the landing place  with a look of sovereign contempt      what is the matter   who is this   said belinda      only the body of my lord delacour   said her ladyship   his bearers  have brought it up the wrong staircase  take it down again  my good  friends  let his lordship go his  own way   don t look so shocked and  amazed  belinda  don t look so  new   child  this funeral of my lord s  intellects is to me a nightly  or   added her ladyship  looking at  her watch and yawning   i believe i should say a  daily  ceremony  six  o clock  i protest      the next morning  as her ladyship and miss portman were sitting at the  breakfast table  after a very late breakfast  lord delacour entered the  room      lord delacour  sober  my dear    said her ladyship to miss portman  by  way of introducing him  prejudiced by her ladyship  belinda was inclined  to think that lord delacour sober would not be more agreeable or more  rational than lord delacour drunk   how old do you take my lord to  be   whispered her ladyship  as she saw belinda s eye fixed upon the  trembling hand which carried his teacup to his lips   i ll lay you a  wager   continued she aloud   i ll lay your birth night dress  gold  fringe  and laurel wreaths into the bargain  that you don t guess  right       i hope you don t think of going to this birth night  lady delacour    said his lordship      i ll give you six guesses  and i ll bet you don t come within sixteen  years   pursued her ladyship  still looking at belinda      you cannot have the new carriage you have bespoken   said his lordship    will you do me the honour to attend to me  lady delacour       then you won t venture to guess  belinda   said her ladyship  without  honouring her lord with the smallest portion of her attention    well   i believe you are right  for certainly you would guess him to be  six and sixty  instead of six and thirty  but then he can drink more  than any two legged animal in his majesty s dominions  and you know that  is an advantage which is well worth twenty or thirty years of a man s  life  especially to persons who have no other chance of distinguishing  themselves       if some people had distinguished themselves a little less in the  world   retorted his lordship   it would have been as well       as well   how flat       flatly then i have to inform you  lady delacour  that i will neither  be contradicted nor laughed at  you understand me   it would be as well   flat or not flat  my lady delacour  if your ladyship would attend more  to your own conduct  and less to others       to  that  of others  his lordship means  if he means any thing   apropos  belinda  did not you tell me clarence hervey is coming to  town   you have never seen him   well  i ll describe him to you by  negatives  he is  not  a man who ever says any thing flat  he is  not   a man who must be wound up with half a dozen bottles of champaign before  he can  go   he is  not  a man who  when he does go  goes wrong  and  won t be set right  he is  not  a man  whose whole consequence  if he  were married  would depend on his wife  he is  not  a man  who  if he  were married  would be so desperately afraid of being governed by his  wife  that he would turn gambler  jockey  or sot  merely to show that he  could govern himself       go on  lady delacour   said his lordship  who had been in vain  attempting to balance a spoon on the edge of his teacup during the whole  of this speech  which was delivered with the most animated desire to  provoke   go on  lady delacour  all i desire is  that you should go on   clarence hervey will be much obliged to you  and i am sure so shall i   go on  my lady delacour  go on  and you ll oblige me       i never will oblige you  my lord  that you may depend upon   cried her  ladyship  with a look of indignant contempt     his lordship whistled  rang for his horses  and looked at his nails with  a smile  belinda  shocked and in a great confusion  rose to leave the  room  dreading the gross continuance of this matrimonial dialogue      mr  hervey  my lady   said a footman  opening the door  and he was  scarcely announced  when her ladyship went forward to receive him with  an air of easy familiarity    where have you buried yourself  hervey   this age past   cried she  shaking hands with him   there s absolutely  no living in this most stupid of all worlds without you   mr   hervey  miss portman  but don t look as if you were half asleep   man  what are you dreaming of  clarence  why looks your grace so heavily  to day       oh  i have passed a miserable night   replied clarence  throwing  himself into an actor s attitude  and speaking in a fine tone of stage  declamation          what was your dream  my lord  i pray you  tell me      said her ladyship in a similar tone   clarence went on           o lord  methought what pain it was to dance       what dreadful noise of fiddles in my ears       what sights of ugly  belles  within my eyes           then came wandering by       a shadow like a devil  with red hair        dizen d with flowers  and she bawl d out aloud       clarence is come  false  fleeting  perjured clarence       o  mrs  luttridge to the life   cried lady delacour   i know where you  have been now  and i pity you  but sit down   said she  making room for  him between belinda and herself upon the sofa   sit down here  and tell  me what could take you to that odious mrs  luttridge s      mr  hervey threw himself on the sofa  lord delacour whistled as before   and left the room without uttering a syllable      but my dream has made me forget myself strangely   said mr  hervey   turning to belinda  and producing her bracelet   mrs  stanhope promised  me that if i delivered it safely  i should be rewarded with the honour  of putting it on the owner s fair arm   a conversation now took place on  the nature of ladies  promises  on fashionable bracelets  on the size  of the arm of the venus de medici  on lady delacour s and miss  portman s  on the thick legs of ancient statues  and on the various  defects and absurdities of mrs  luttridge and her wig  on all these  topics mr  hervey displayed much wit  gallantry  and satire  with so  happy an effect  that belinda  when he took leave  was precisely of her  aunt s opinion  that he was a most uncommonly pleasant young man     clarence hervey might have been more than a pleasant young man  if he  had not been smitten with the desire of being thought superior in every  thing  and of being the most admired person in all companies  he had  been early flattered with the idea that he was a man of genius  and  he imagined that  as such  he was entitled to be imprudent  wild  and  eccentric  he affected singularity  in order to establish his claims  to genius  he had considerable literary talents  by which he was  distinguished at oxford  but he was so dreadfully afraid of passing  for a pedant  that when he came into the company of the idle and the  ignorant  he pretended to disdain every species of knowledge  his  chameleon character seemed to vary in different lights  and according to  the different situations in which he happened to be placed  he could  be all things to all men  and to all women  he was supposed to be a  favourite with the fair sex  and of all his various excellencies and  defects  there was none on which he valued himself so much as on his  gallantry  he was not profligate  he had a strong sense of honour   and quick feelings of humanity  but he was so easily led  or rather so  easily excited by his companions  and his companions were now of such  a sort  that it was probable he would soon become vicious  as to his  connexion with lady delacour  he would have started with horror at the  idea of disturbing the peace of a family  but in her family  he said   there was no peace to disturb  he was vain of having it seen by the  world that he was distinguished by a lady of her wit and fashion  and  he did not think it incumbent on him to be more scrupulous or more  attentive to appearances than her ladyship  by lord delacour s jealousy  he was sometimes provoked  sometimes amused  and sometimes flattered   he was constantly of all her ladyship s parties in public and private   consequently he saw belinda almost every day  and every day he saw her  with increasing admiration of her beauty  and with increasing dread of  being taken in to marry a niece of  the  catch match maker    the name  by which mrs  stanhope was known amongst the men of his acquaintance   young ladies who have the misfortune to be  conducted  by these artful  dames  are always supposed to be partners in all the speculations   though their names may not appear in the firm  if he had not been  prejudiced by the character of her aunt  mr  hervey would have thought  belinda an undesigning  unaffected girl  but now he suspected her of  artifice in every word  look  and motion  and even when he felt himself  most charmed by her powers of pleasing  he was most inclined to despise  her  for what he thought such premature proficiency in scientific  coquetry  he had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond the sphere  of her attraction  but  frequently  when he found himself within it  he  cursed his folly  and drew back with sudden terror  his manner towards  her was so variable and inconsistent  that she knew not how to interpret  its language  sometimes she fancied  that with all the eloquence of eyes  he said    i adore you   belinda   at other times she imagined that  his guarded silence meant to warn her that he was so entangled by lady  delacour  that he could not extricate himself from her snares  whenever  this last idea struck her  it excited  in the most edifying manner  her  indignation against coquetry in general  and against her ladyship s  in particular  she became wonderfully clear sighted to all the  improprieties of her ladyship s conduct  belinda s newly acquired moral  sense was so much shocked  that she actually wrote a full statement of  her observations and her scruples to her aunt stanhope  concluding by  a request  that she might not remain under the protection of a lady  of  whose character she could not approve  and whose intimacy might perhaps  be injurious to her reputation  if not to her principles     mrs  stanhope answered belinda s letter in a very guarded style  she  rebuked her niece severely for her imprudence in mentioning  names  in  such a manner  in a letter sent by the common post  assured her that her  reputation was in no danger  that she hoped no niece of hers would set  up for a prude  a character more suspected by men of the world than  even that of a coquette  that the person alluded to was a perfectly fit  chaperon for any young lady to appear with in public  as long as she  was visited by the first people in town  that as to any thing in the   private  conduct of that person  and as to any  private brouillieries   between her and her lord  belinda should observe on these dangerous  topics a profound silence  both in her letters and her conversation   that as long as the lady continued under the protection of her husband   the world might whisper  but would not speak out  that as to belinda s  own principles  she would be utterly inexcusable if  after the education  she had received  they could be hurt by any bad examples  that she could  not be too cautious in her management of a man of      s character   that she could have no  serious  cause for jealousy in the quarter she  apprehended  as marriage there could not be the object  and there was  such a difference of age  that no permanent influence could probably be  obtained by the lady  that the most certain method for miss portman to  expose herself to the ridicule of one of the parties  and to the total  neglect of the other  would be to betray anxiety or jealousy  that  in  short  if she were fool enough to lose her own heart  there would be  little chance of her being wise enough to win that of       who was  evidently a man of gallantry rather than of sentiment  and who was known  to play his cards well  and to have good luck whenever  hearts  were  trumps     belinda s fears of lady delacour  as a dangerous rival  were much  quieted by the artful insinuations of mrs  stanhope  with respect to her  age   c   and in proportion as her fears subsided  she blamed herself  for having written too harshly of her ladyship s conduct  the idea that  whilst she appeared as lady delacour s friend she ought not to propagate  any stories to her disadvantage  operated powerfully upon belinda s  mind  and she reproached herself for having told even her aunt what she  had seen in private  she thought that she had been guilty of treachery   and she wrote again immediately to mrs  stanhope  to conjure her to burn  her last letter  to forget  if possible  its contents  and to believe  that not a syllable of a similar nature should ever more be heard from  her  she was just concluding with the words   i hope my dear aunt will  consider all this as an error of my judgment  and not of my heart    when lady delacour burst into the room  exclaiming  in a tone of gaiety    tragedy or comedy  belinda  the masquerade dresses are come  but how s  this   added she  looking full in belinda s face   tears in the eyes   blushes in the cheeks  tremors in the joints  and letters shuffling  away  but  you novice of novices  how awkwardly shuffled   a niece of  mrs  stanhope s  and so unpractised a shuffler   and is it credible she  should tremble in this ridiculous way about a love letter or two       no love letters  indeed  lady delacour   said belinda  holding the  paper fast  as her ladyship  half in play  half in earnest  attempted to  snatch it from her      no love letters  then it must be treason  and see it i must  by all  that s good  or by all that s bad  i see the name of delacour    and  her ladyship absolutely seized the letters by force  in spite of all  belinda s struggles and entreaties      i beg  i request  i conjure you not to read it   cried miss portman   clasping her hands   read mine  read mine  if you  must   but don t read  my aunt stanhope s  oh  i beg  i entreat  i conjure you   and she threw  herself upon her knees      you beg  you entreat  you conjure  why  this is like the duchess de  brinvilliers  who wrote on her paper of poisons   whoever finds this  i  entreat  i conjure them  in the name of more saints than i can remember   not to open the paper any farther    what a simpleton  to know so little  of the nature of curiosity      as she spoke  lady delacour opened mrs  stanhope s letter  read it from  beginning to end  folded it up coolly when she had finished it  and  simply said   the  person alluded to  is almost as bad as her name at  full length  does mrs  stanhope think no one can make out an inuendo  in a libel  or fill up a blank  but an attorney general   pointing to a  blank in mrs  stanhope s letter  left for the name of clarence hervey     belinda was in too much confusion either to speak or think      you were right to swear they were not love letters   pursued her  ladyship  laying down the papers   i protest i snatched them by way of  frolic  i beg pardon  all i can do now is not to read the rest       nay  i beg  i wish  i insist upon your reading mine   said belinda     when lady delacour had read it  her countenance suddenly changed   worth  a hundred of your aunt s  i declare   said she  patting belinda s cheek    what a treasure to meet with any thing like a  new  heart   all hearts   now a days  are second hand  at best      lady delacour spoke with a tone of feeling which belinda had never heard  from her before  and which at this moment touched her so much  that she  took her ladyship s hand and kissed it           chapter ii     masks       where were we when all this began   cried lady delacour  forcing  herself to resume an air of gaiety   o  masquerade was the order of the  day   tragedy or comedy  which suits your genius best  my dear       whichever suits your ladyship s taste least       why  my woman  marriott  says i ought to be tragedy  and  upon the  notion that people always succeed best when they take characters  diametrically opposite to their own  clarence hervey s  principle  perhaps you don t think that he has any principles  but there  you are wrong  i do assure you  he has sound principles  of taste       of that   said belinda  with a constrained smile   he gives the most  convincing proof  by his admiring your ladyship so much       and by his admiring miss portman so much more  but whilst we are making  speeches to one another  poor marriott is standing in distress  like  garrick  between tragedy and comedy      lady delacour opened her dressing room door  and pointed to her as she  stood with the dress of the comic muse on one arm  and the tragic muse  on the other      i am afraid i have not spirits enough to undertake the comic muse    said miss portman     marriott  who was a personage of prodigious consequence  and the judge  in the last resort at her mistress s toilette  looked extremely out of  humour at having been kept waiting so long  and yet more so at the idea  that her appellant jurisdiction could be disputed      your ladyship s taller than miss portman by half ahead   said marriott    and to be sure will best become tragedy with this long train  besides   i had settled all the rest of your ladyship s dress  tragedy  they  say  is always tall  and  no offence  your ladyship s taller than miss  portman by half a head       for head read inch   said lady delacour   if you please       when things are settled  one can t bear to have them unsettled  but  your ladyship must have your own way  to be sure  i ll say no more    cried she  throwing down the dresses      stay  marriott   said lady delacour  and she placed herself between the  angry waiting maid and the door      why will you  who are the best creature in the world  put yourself into  these  furies  about nothing  have patience with us  and you shall be  satisfied       that s another affair   said marriott      miss portman   continued her ladyship   don t talk of not having  spirits  you that are all life   what say you  belinda   o yes  you must  be the comic muse  and i  it seems  must be tragedy  because marriott  has a passion for seeing me  come sweeping by   and because marriott  must have her own way in every thing  she rules me with a rod of iron   my dear  so tragedy i needs must be    marriott knows her power       there was an air of extreme vexation in lady delacour s countenance as  she pronounced these last words  in which evidently more was meant  than met the ear  upon many occasions miss portman had observed  that  marriott exercised despotic authority over her mistress  and she had  seen  with surprise  that a lady  who would not yield an iota of power  to her husband  submitted herself to every caprice of the most insolent  of waiting women  for some time  belinda imagined that this submission  was merely an air  as she had seen some other fine ladies proud of  appearing to be governed by a favourite maid  but she was soon convinced  that marriott was no favourite with lady delacour  that her ladyship s  was not  proud humility   but fear  it seemed certain that a woman   extravagantly fond of her own  will   would never have given it up  without some very substantial reason  it seemed as if marriott was in  possession of some secret  which should for ever remain unknown  this  idea had occurred to miss portman more than once  but never so forcibly  as upon the present occasion  there had always been some mystery about  her ladyship s toilette  at certain hours doors were bolted  and it was  impossible for any body but marriott to obtain admission  miss portman  at first imagined that lady delacour dreaded the discovery of her  cosmetic secrets  but her ladyship s rouge was so glaring  and her pearl  powder was so obvious  that belinda was convinced there must be some  other cause for this toilette secrecy  there was a little cabinet beyond  her bedchamber  which lady delacour called her boudoir  to which there  was an entrance by a back staircase  but no one ever entered there but  marriott  one night  lady delacour  after dancing with great spirit at  a ball  at her own house  fainted suddenly  miss portman attended her  to her bedchamber  but marriott begged that her lady might be left alone  with  her   and she would by no means suffer belinda to follow her into  the boudoir  all these things belinda recollected in the space of a few  seconds  as she stood contemplating marriott and the dresses  the hurry  of getting ready for the masquerade  however  dispelled these thoughts   and by the time she was dressed  the idea of what clarence hervey would  think of her appearance was uppermost in her mind  she was anxious to  know whether he would discover her in the character of the comic muse   lady delacour was discontented with her tragic attire  and she grew  still more out of humour with herself  when she saw belinda      i protest marriott has made a perfect fright of me   said her ladyship   as she got into her carriage   and i m positive my dress would become  you a million of times better than your own      miss portman regretted that it was too late to change      not at all too late  my dear   said lady delacour   never too late for  women to change their minds  their dress  or their lovers  seriously   you know  we are to call at my friend lady singleton s  she sees masks  to night  i m quite intimate there  i ll make her let me step up to her  own room  where no soul can interrupt us  and there we can change our  dresses  and marriott will know nothing of the matter  marriott s a  faithful creature  and very fond of me  fond of power too  but who is  not   we must all have our faults  one would not quarrel with such a  good creature as marriott for a trifle   then suddenly changing her  tone  she said   not a human being will find us out at the masquerade   for no one but mrs  freke knows that we are the two muses  clarence  hervey swears he should know me in any disguise  but i defy him  i shall  take special delight in puzzling him  harriot freke has told him  in  confidence  that i m to be the widow brady  in man s clothes  now that s  to be harriot s own character  so hervey will make fine confusion      as soon as they got to lady singleton s  lady delacour and miss portman  immediately went up stairs to exchange dresses  poor belinda  now that  she felt herself in spirits to undertake the comic muse  was rather  vexed to be obliged to give up her becoming character  but there was no  resisting the polite energy of lady delacour s vanity  her ladyship ran  as quick as lightning into a closet within the dressing room  saying  to lady singleton s woman  who attempted to follow with   can i do any  thing for your ladyship     no  no  no  nothing  nothing  thank ye   thank ye   i want no assistance  i never let any body do any thing for  me but marriott   and she bolted herself in the closet  in a few minutes  she half opened the door  threw out her tragic robes  and cried   here   miss portman  give me yours  quick  and let s see whether comedy or  tragedy will be ready first       lord bless and forgive me   said lady singleton s woman  when  lady delacour at last threw open the door  when she was completely  dressed   but if your la ship has not been dressing all this time in  that den  without any thing in the shape of a looking glass  and not to  let me help  i that should have been so proud      lady delacour put half a guinea into the waiting maid s hand  laughed  affectedly at her own  whimsicalities   and declared that she could  always dress herself better without a glass than with one  all this went  off admirably well with every body but miss portman  she could not help  thinking it extraordinary that a person who was obviously fond of being  waited upon would never suffer any person to assist her at her toilet  except marriott  a woman of whom she was evidently afraid  lady  delacour s quick eye saw curiosity painted in belinda s countenance  and  for a moment she was embarrassed  but she soon recovered herself  and  endeavoured to turn the course of miss portman s thoughts by whispering  to her some nonsense about clarence hervey  a cabalistical name  which  she knew had the power  when pronounced in a certain tone  of throwing  belinda into confusion     the first person they saw  when they went into the drawing room at lady  singleton s  was this very clarence hervey  who was not in a masquerade  dress  he had laid a wager with one of his acquaintance  that he  could perform the part of the serpent  such as he is seen in fuseli s  well known picture  for this purpose he had exerted much ingenuity  in the invention and execution of a length of coiled skin  which he  manoeuvred with great dexterity  by means of internal wires  his grand  difficulty had been to manufacture the rays that were to come from his  eyes  he had contrived a set of phosphoric rays  which he was certain  would charm all the fair daughters of eve  he forgot  it seems  that  phosphorus could not well be seen by candlelight  when he was just  equipped as a serpent  his rays set fire to part of his  envelope   and  it was with the greatest difficulty that he was extricated  he escaped  unhurt  but his serpent s skin was utterly consumed  nothing remained  but the melancholy spectacle of its skeleton  he was obliged to give up  the hopes of shining at the masquerade  but he resolved to be at lady  singleton s that he might meet lady delacour and miss portman  the  moment that the tragic and comic muse appeared  he invoked them with  much humour and mock pathos  declaring that he knew not which of them  could best sing his adventure  after a recital of his misfortune had  entertained the company  and after the muses had performed their parts  to the satisfaction of the audience and their own  the conversation  ceased to be supported in masquerade character  muses and harlequins   gipsies and cleopatras  began to talk of their private affairs  and of  the news and the scandal of the day     a group of gentlemen  amongst whom was clarence hervey  gathered round  the tragic muse  as mr  hervey had hinted that he knew she was a  person of distinction  though he would not tell her name  after he had  exercised his wit for some time  without obtaining from the tragic muse  one single syllable  he whispered   lady delacour  why this unnatural  reserve  do you imagine that  through this tragical disguise  i have not  found you out      the tragic muse  apparently absorbed in meditation  vouchsafed no reply      the devil a word can you get for your pains  hervey   said a gentleman  of his acquaintance  who joined the party at this instant   why didn t  you stick to t other muse  who  to do her justice  is as arrant a flirt  as your heart could wish for       there s danger in flirting   said clarence   with an arrant flirt of  mrs  stanhope s training  there s a kind of electricity about that girl   i have a sort of cobweb feeling  an imaginary net coming all over me       fore warned is fore armed   replied his companion   a man must be a  novice indeed that could be taken in at this time of day by a niece of  mrs  stanhope s       that mrs  stanhope must be a good clever dame  faith   said a third  gentleman   there s no less than six of her nieces whom she has got  off within these four winters  not one of  em now that has not made a  catch match   there s the eldest of the set  mrs  tollemache  what had  she  in the devil s name  to set up with in the world but a pair of good  eyes   her aunt  to be sure  taught her the use of them early enough   they might have rolled to all eternity before they would have rolled me  out of my senses  but you see they did tollemache s business  however   they are going to part now  i hear  tollemache was tired of her before  the honey moon was over  as i foretold  then there s the musical girl   joddrell  who has no more ear than a post  went and married her  because  he had a mind to set up for a connoisseur in music  and mrs  stanhope  flattered him that he was one      the gentlemen joined in the general laugh  the tragic muse sighed      even were she at the school for scandal  the tragic muse dare not  laugh  except behind her mask   said clarence hervey      far be it from her to laugh at those follies which she must for ever  deplore   said belinda  in a feigned voice    what miseries spring from  these ill suited marriages  the victims are sacrificed before they have  sense enough to avoid their fate      clarence hervey imagined that this speech alluded to lady delacour s own  marriage      damn me if i know any woman  young or old  that would  avoid  being  married  if she could  though   cried sir philip baddely  a gentleman  who always supplied  each vacuity of sense  with an oath   but   rochfort  didn t valleton marry one of these nieces       yes  she was a mighty fine dancer  and had good legs enough  mrs   stanhope got poor valleton to fight a duel about her place in a country  dance  and then he was so pleased with himself for his prowess  that he  married the girl      belinda made an effort to change her seat  but she was encompassed so  that she could not retreat      as to jenny mason  the fifth of the  nieces    continued the witty  gentleman   she was as brown as mahogany  and had neither eyes  nose   mouth  nor legs  what mrs  stanhope could do with her i often wondered   but she took courage   rouged  her up  set her a going as a  dasher    and she dashed herself into tom levit s curricle  and tom couldn t get  her out again till she was the honourable mrs  levit  she then took the  reins into her own hands  and i hear she s driving him and herself  the  road to ruin  as fast as they can gallop  as for this belinda portman    twas a good hit to send her to lady delacour s  but  i take it she  hangs upon hand  for last winter  when i was at bath  she was hawked  about every where  and the aunt was puffing her with might and main  you  heard of nothing  wherever you went  but of belinda portman  and belinda  portman s accomplishments  belinda portman  and her accomplishments   i ll swear  were as well advertised as packwood s razor strops       mrs  stanhope overdid the business  i think   resumed the gentleman who  began the conversation   girls brought to the hammer this way don t go  off well  it s true  christie himself is no match for dame stanhope   many of my acquaintance were tempted to go and look at the premises  but  not one  you may be sure  had a thought of becoming a tenant for life       that s an honour reserved for you  clarence hervey   said another   tapping him upon the shoulder    give ye joy  hervey  give ye joy       me   said clarence  starting      i ll be hanged if he didn t change colour   said his facetious  companion  and all the young men again joined in a laugh      laugh on  my merry men all   cried clarence   but the devil s in it if  i don t know my own mind better than any of you  you don t imagine i  go to lady delacour s to look for a  wife    belinda portman s a good  pretty girl  but what then  do you think i m an idiot   do you think i  could be taken in by one of the stanhope school  do you think i don t  see as plainly as any of you that belinda portman s a composition of art  and affectation       hush  not so loud  clarence  here she comes   said his companion   the  comic muse  is not she        lady delacour  at this moment  came lightly tripping towards them   and addressing herself  in the character of the comic muse  to hervey   exclaimed      hervey   my  hervey  most favoured of my votaries  why do you forsake  me          why mourns my friend  why weeps his downcast eye        that eye where mirth and fancy used to shine      though you have lost your serpent s form  yet you may please any of the  fair daughters of eve in your own      mr  hervey bowed  all the gentlemen who stood near him smiled  the  tragic muse gave an involuntary sigh      could i borrow a sigh  or a tear  from my tragic sister   pursued lady  delacour   however unbecoming to my character  i would  if only sighs or  tears can win the heart of clarence hervey   let me practise   and her  ladyship practised sighing with much comic effect          persuasive words and more persuasive sighs      said clarence hervey      a good bold stanhope cast of the net  faith   whispered one of his  companions   melpomene  hast thou forgot thyself to marble   pursued  lady delacour   i am not very well   whispered miss portman to her  ladyship   could we get away       get away from clarence hervey  do you mean   replied her ladyship  in  a whisper    tis not easy  but we ll try what can be done  if it is  necessary      belinda had no power to reply to this raillery  indeed  she scarcely  heard the words that were said to her  but she put her arm within lady  delacour s  who  to her great relief  had the good nature to leave the  room with her immediately  her ladyship  though she would sacrifice the  feelings of others  without compunction  to her vanity  whenever  the power of her wit was disputed  yet towards those by whom it was  acknowledged she showed some mercy      what is the matter with the child   said she  as she went down the  staircase      nothing  if i could have air   said belinda  there was a crowd of  servants in the hall      why does lady delacour avoid me so pertinaciously  what crime have i  committed  that i was not favoured with one word   said clarence hervey   who had followed them down stairs  and overtook them in the hall      do see if you can find any of my people   cried lady delacour      lady delacour  the comic muse   exclaimed mr  hervey   i thought        no matter what you thought   interrupted her ladyship   let my  carriage draw up  for here s a young friend of yours trembling so about   nothing   that i am half afraid she will faint  and you know it would  not be so pleasant to faint here amongst footmen  stay  this room is  empty  o  i did not mean to tell  you  to stay   said she to hervey  who  involuntarily followed her in the utmost consternation      i m perfectly well  now  perfectly well   said belinda      perfectly a simpleton  i think   said lady delacour   nay  my dear  you  must be ruled  your mask must come off  didn t you tell me you wanted  air   what now  this is not the first time clarence hervey has ever  seen your face without a mask  is it  it s the first time indeed he  or  anybody else  ever saw it of such a colour  i believe      when lady delacour pulled off belinda s mask  her face was  during the  first instant  pale  the next moment  crimsoned over with a burning  blush      what is the matter with ye both  how he stands   said lady delacour   turning to mr  hervey   did you never see a woman blush before   or did  you never say or do any thing to make a woman blush before  will you  give miss portman a glass of water   there s some behind you on that  sideboard  man   but he has neither eyes  ears  nor understanding   do  go about your business   said her ladyship  pushing him towards the  door   do go about your business  for i haven t common patience with  you  on my conscience i believe the man s in love  and not with me   that s sal volatile for you  child  i perceive   continued she to  belinda   o  you can walk now  but remember you are on slippery ground   remember clarence hervey is not a marrying man  and you are not a  married woman       it is perfectly indifferent to me  madam   belinda said  with a voice  and look of proud indignation      lady delacour  your carriage has drawn up   said clarence hervey   returning to the door  but without entering      then put this  perfectly well  and  perfectly indifferent  lady into  it   said lady delacour     he obeyed without uttering a syllable      dumb  absolutely dumb  i protest   said her ladyship  as he handed her  in afterwards   why  clarence  the casting of your serpent s skin seems  to have quite changed your nature  nothing but the simplicity of the  dove left  and i expect to hear  you cooing presently  don t you  miss  portman   she ordered the coachman to drive to the pantheon      to the pantheon  i was in hopes your ladyship would have the goodness  to set me down at home  for indeed i shall be a burden to you and  everybody else at the masquerade       if you have made any appointment for the rest of the evening in  berkley square  i ll set you down  certainly  if you insist upon it  my  dear  for punctuality is a virtue  but prudence is a virtue too  in a  young lady  who  as your aunt stanhope would say  has to  establish   herself in the world  why these tears  belinda   or are they tears  for  by the light of the lamps i can scarcely tell  though i ll swear i saw  the handkerchief at the eyes  what is the meaning of all this  you d  best trust me  for i know as much of men and manners as your aunt  stanhope at least  and in one word  you have nothing to fear from me   and every thing to hope from yourself  if you will only dry up your  tears   keep on your mask   and take my advice  you ll find it as good  as your aunt stanhope s       my aunt stanhope s  o   cried belinda   never  never more will i take  such advice  never more will i expose myself to be insulted as a female  adventurer   little did i know in what a light i appeared  little did  i know what  gentlemen  thought of my aunt stanhope  of my cousins  of  myself        gentlemen   i presume clarence hervey stands at this instant  in your  imagination  as the representative of all the gentlemen in england  and  he  instead of anacharsis cloots  is now  to be sure  l orateur du genre  humain  pray let me have a specimen of the eloquence  which  to judge by  its effects  must be powerful indeed      miss portman  not without some reluctance  repeated the conversation  which she had heard    and is this all   cried lady delacour   lord   my dear  you must either give up living in the world  or expect to  hear yourself  and your aunts  and your cousins  and your friends  from  generation to generation  abused every hour in the day by their friends  and your friends   tis the common course of things  now you know what a  multitude of obedient humble servants  dear creatures  and very sincere  and most affectionate friends  i have in my writing desk  and on my  mantel piece  not to mention the cards which crowd the common rack from  intimate acquaintance  who cannot live without the honour  or favour   or pleasure of seeing lady delacour twice a week   do you think i m fool  enough to imagine that they would care the hundredth part of a straw if  i were this minute thrown into the red or the black sea   no  i have not  one  real  friend in the world except harriot freke  yet  you see i  am the comic muse  and mean to keep it up  keep it up to the last  on  purpose to provoke those who would give their eyes to be able to pity  me   i humbly thank them  no pity for lady delacour  follow my example   belinda  elbow your way through the crowd  if you stop to be civil and  beg pardon  and   hope i didn t hurt ye    you will be trod under foot   now you ll meet those young men continually who took the liberty of  laughing at your aunt  and your cousins  and yourself  they are men of  fashion  show them you ve no feeling  and they ll acknowledge you for  a woman of fashion  you ll marry better than any of your  cousins   clarence hervey if you can  and then it will be your turn to  laugh about nets and cages  as to love and all that       the carriage stopped at the pantheon just as her ladyship came to the  words  love and all that   her thoughts took a different turn  and  during the remainder of the night she exhibited  in such a manner as to  attract universal admiration  all the ease  and grace  and gaiety  of  euphrosyne     to belinda the night appeared long and dull  the commonplace wit of  chimney sweepers and gipsies  the antics of harlequins  the graces  of flower girls and cleopatras  had not power to amuse her  for her  thoughts still recurred to that conversation which had given her so much  pain  a pain which lady delacour s raillery had failed to obliterate      how happy you are  lady delacour   said she  when they got into the  carriage to go home   how happy you are to have such an amazing flow of  spirits       amazing you might well say  if you knew all   said lady delacour  and  she heaved a deep sigh  threw herself back in the carriage  let fall her  mask  and was silent  it was broad daylight  and belinda had a full view  of her countenance  which was the picture of despair  she uttered not  one syllable more  nor had miss portman the courage to interrupt her  meditations till they came within sight  of lady singleton s  when  belinda ventured to remind her that she had resolved to stop there and  change dresses before marriott saw them      no  it s no matter   said lady delacour   marriott will leave me at the  last  like all the rest   tis no matter   her ladyship sunk back into  her former attitude  but after she had remained silent for some minutes   she started up and exclaimed       if i had served myself with half the zeal that i have served the  world  i should not now be thus forsaken  i have sacrificed reputation   happiness  every thing to the love of frolic   all frolic will soon be  at an end with me  i am dying  and i shall die unlamented by any human  being  if i were to live my life over again  what a different life it  should be   what a different person  i would be       but it is all over  now  i am dying      belinda s astonishment at these words  and at the solemn manner in which  they were pronounced  was inexpressible  she gazed at lady delacour  and  then repeated the word    dying     yes  dying   said lady delacour      but you seem to me  and to all the world  in perfect health  and but  half an hour ago in perfect spirits   said belinda      i seem to you and to all the world  what i am not  i tell you i am  dying   said her ladyship in an emphatic tone     not a word more passed till they got home  lady delacour hurried up  stairs  bidding belinda follow her to her dressing room  marriott was  lighting the six wax candles on the dressing table    as i live  they  have changed dresses after all   said marriott to herself  as she fixed  her eyes upon lady delacour and miss portman   i ll be burnt  if i don t  make my lady remember this       marriott  you need not wait  i ll ring when i want you   said lady  delacour  and taking one of the candles from the table  she passed  on hastily with miss portman through her dressing room  through her  bedchamber  and to the door of the mysterious cabinet      marriott  the key of this door   cried she impatiently  after she had  in vain attempted to open it      heavenly graciousness   cried marriott   is my lady out of her senses       the key  the key  quick  the key   repeated lady delacour  in a  peremptory tone  she seized it as soon as marriott drew it from her  pocket  and unlocked the door      had not i best put  the things  to rights  my lady   said marriott   catching fast hold of the opening door      i ll ring when you are wanted  marriott   said lady delacour  and  pushing open the door with violence she rushed forward to the middle of  the room  and turning back  she beckoned to belinda to follow her   come  in  what is it you are afraid of   said she  belinda went on  and the  moment she was in the room  lady delacour shut and locked the door  the  room was rather dark  as there was no light in it except what came from  the candle which lady delacour held in her hand  and which burned but  dimly  belinda  as she looked round  saw nothing but a confusion of  linen rags  vials  some empty  some full  and she perceived that there  was a strong smell of medicines     lady delacour  whose motions were all precipitate  like those of a  person whose mind is in great agitation  looked from side to side of the  room  without seeming to know what she was in search of  she then   with a species of fury  wiped the paint from her face  and returning to  belinda  held the candle so as to throw the light full upon her livid  features  her eyes were sunk  her cheeks hollow  no trace of youth or  beauty remained on her death like countenance  which formed a horrid  contrast with her gay fantastic dress      you are shocked  belinda   said she   but as yet you have seen  nothing  look here    and baring one half of her bosom  she revealed a  hideous spectacle     belinda sunk back into a chair  lady delacour flung herself on her knees  before her      am i humbled  am i wretched enough   cried she  her voice trembling  with agony   yes  pity me for what you have seen  and a thousand times  more for that which you cannot see   my mind is eaten away like my  body by incurable disease  inveterate remorse  remorse for a life of  folly  of folly which has brought on me all the punishments of guilt       my husband   continued she  and her voice suddenly altered from the  tone of grief to that of anger   my husband hates me  no matter  i  despise him  his relations hate me  no matter  i despise them  my own  relations hate me  no matter  i never wish to see them more  never shall  they see my sorrow  never shall they hear a complaint  a sigh from me   there is no torture which i could not more easily endure than their  insulting pity  i will die  as i have lived  the envy and admiration  of the world  when i am gone  let them find out their mistake  and  moralize  if they will  over my grave   she paused  belinda had no power  to speak      promise  swear to me   resumed lady delacour vehemently  seizing  belinda s hand   that you will never reveal to any mortal what you  have seen and heard this night  no living creature suspects that lady  delacour is dying by inches  except marriott and that woman whom but a  few hours ago i thought my  real friend   to whom i trusted every secret  of my life  every thought of my heart  fool  idiot  dupe that i was to  trust to the friendship of a woman whom i knew to be without principle   but i thought she had honour  i thought she could never betray  me    o  harriot  harriot  you to desert me   any thing else i could have  borne  but you  who i thought would have supported me in the tortures of  mind and body which i am to go through  you that i thought would receive  my last breath  you to desert me   now i am alone in the world  left to  the mercy of an insolent waiting woman      lady delacour hid her face in belinda s lap  and almost stifled by the  violence of contending emotions  she at last gave vent to them  and  sobbed aloud      trust to one   said belinda  pressing her hand  with all the tenderness  which humanity could dictate   who will never leave you at the mercy of  an insolent waiting woman  trust to me       trust to you   said lady delacour  looking up eagerly in belinda s  face   yes  i think  i may trust to you  for though a niece of mrs   stanhope s  i have seen this day  and have seen with surprise  symptoms  of artless feeling about you  this was what tempted me to open my mind  to you when i found that i had lost the only friend  but i will think  no more of that  if you have a heart  you must feel for me   leave  me now  tomorrow you shall hear my whole history  now i am quite  exhausted  ring for marriott   marriott appeared with a face of  constrained civility and latent rage   put me to bed  marriott   said  lady delacour  with a subdued voice   but first light miss portman to  her room  she need not  yet  see the horrid business of my toilette      belinda  when she was left alone  immediately opened her shutters  and  threw up the sash  to refresh herself with the morning air  she felt  excessively fatigued  and in the hurry of her mind she could not think  of any thing distinctly  she took off her masquerade dress  and went  to bed in hopes of forgetting  for a few hours  what she felt indelibly  impressed upon her imagination  but it was in vain that she endeavoured  to compose herself to sleep  her ideas were in too great and painful  confusion  for some time  whenever she closed her eyes  the face and  form of lady delacour  such as she had just beheld them  seemed to  haunt her  afterwards  the idea of clarence hervey  and the painful  recollection of the conversation she had overheard  recurred to her  the  words   do you think i don t know that belinda portman is a composition  of art and affectation   fixed in her memory  she recollected with the  utmost minuteness every look of contempt which she had seen in the faces  of the young men whilst they spoke of mrs  stanhope  the match maker   belinda s mind  however  was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect  she  seemed only to live over again the preceding night  at last  the strange  motley figures which she had seen at the masquerade flitted before her  eyes  and she sunk into an uneasy slumber           chapter iii     lady delacour s history       miss portman was awakened by the ringing of lady delacour s bedchamber  bell  she opened her eyes with the confused idea that something  disagreeable had happened  and before she had distinctly recollected  herself  marriott came to her bedside  with a note from lady delacour   it was written with a pencil      delacour   my  lord     is to have to day what garrick used to call  a  gander feast   will you dine with me tete a tete  and i ll write  an  excuse   alias a lie  to lady singleton  in the form of a charming  note  i pique myself  sur l eloquence du billet   then we shall have the  evening to ourselves  i have much to say  as people usually have when  they begin to talk of themselves      i have taken a double dose of opium  and am not so horribly out of  spirits as i was last night  so you need not be afraid of another   scene       let me see you in my dressing room  dear belinda  as soon as you have  adored         with head uncover d the cosmetic powers       but you don t paint  no matter  you will  you must  every body must   sooner or later  in the mean time  whenever you want to send a note that  shall not be opened by  the bearer   put your trust neither in wafer  nor wax  but twist it as i twist mine  you see i wish to put you in  possession of some valuable secrets before i leave this world  this   by the bye  i don t  upon second thoughts  which are always best  mean  to do yet  there certainly were such people as amazons  i hope you  admire them  for who could live without the admiration of belinda  portman   not clarence hervey assuredly  nor yet     t  c  h  delacour      belinda obeyed the summons to her ladyship s dressing room  she found  lady delacour with her face completely repaired with paint  and her  spirits with opium  she was in high consultation with marriott and mrs   franks  the milliner  about the crape petticoat of her birthnight  dress  which was extended over a large hoop in full state  mrs  franks  descanted long and learnedly upon festoons and loops  knots and fringes   submitting all the time every thing to her ladyship s better judgment     marriott was sulky and silent  she opened her lips but once upon the  question of laburnum or no laburnum flowers     against them she quoted the memoirs and authority of the celebrated mrs   bellamy  who has a case in point to prove that  straw colour must ever  look like dirty white by candlelight   mrs  franks  to compromise the  matter  proposed gold laburnums   because nothing can look better by  candlelight  or any light  than gold   and lady delacour  who was afraid  that the milliner s imagination  now that it had once touched upon gold   might be led to the vulgar idea of  ready money   suddenly broke up the  conference  by exclaiming      we shall be late at phillips s exhibition of french china  mrs  franks  must let us see her again to morrow  to take into consideration  your court dress  my dear belinda   miss portman presented by lady  delacour   mrs  franks  let her dress  for heaven s sake  be something  that will make a fine paragraph   i give you four and twenty hours to  think of it  i have done a horrid act this day   continued she  after  mrs  franks had left the room   absolutely written a  twisted  note to  clarence hervey  my dear  but why did i tell you that  now your head  will run upon the twisted note all day  instead of upon  the life and  opinions of a lady of quality  related by herself       after dinner lady delacour having made belinda protest and blush  and  blush and protest  that her head was not running upon the twisted note   began the history of her life and opinions in the following manner        i do nothing by halves  my dear  i shall not tell you my adventures as  gil blas told his to the count d olivarez  skipping over the  useful   passages  i am no hypocrite  and have nothing worse than folly to  conceal  that s bad enough  for a woman who is known to play the fool  is always suspected of playing the devil  but i begin where i ought  to end  with my moral  which i dare say you are not impatient to  anticipate  i never read or listened to a moral at the end of a story in  my life   manners for me  and morals for those that like them  my dear   you will be woefully disappointed if in my story you expect any thing  like a novel  i once heard a general say  that nothing was less like a  review than a battle  and i can tell you that nothing is more unlike a  novel than real life  of all lives  mine has been the least romantic   no love in it  but a great deal of hate  i was a rich heiress  i had  i  believe  a hundred thousand pounds  or more  and twice as many caprices   i was handsome and witty  or  to speak with that kind of circumlocution  which is called humility  the world  the partial world  thought me a  beauty and a bel esprit  having told you my fortune  need i add  that i   or it  had lovers in abundance  of all sorts and degrees  not to reckon  those  it may be presumed  who died of concealed passions for me  i had  sixteen declarations and proposals in form  then what in the name  of wonder  or of common sense  which by the bye is the greatest of  wonders  what  in the name of common sense  made me marry lord delacour   why  my dear  you  no  not  you   but any girl who is not used to have  a parcel of admirers  would think it the easiest thing in the world to  make her choice  but let her judge by what she feels when a dexterous  mercer or linen draper produces pretty thing after pretty thing  and  this is so becoming  and this will wear for ever  as he swears  but then  that s so fashionable   the novice stands in a charming perplexity  and  after examining  and doubting  and tossing over half the goods in the  shop  it s ten to one  when it begins to get late  the young lady  in a  hurry  pitches upon the very ugliest and worst thing that she has seen   just so it was with me and my lovers  and just so          sad was the hour  and luckless was the day      i pitched upon viscount delacour for my lord and judge  he had just at  that time lost at newmarket more than he was worth in every sense of the  word  and my fortune was the most convenient thing in the world to a man  in his condition  lozenges are of sovereign use in some complaints  the  heiress lozenge is a specific in some consumptions  you are surprised  that i can laugh and jest about such a melancholy thing as my marriage  with lord delacour  and so am i  especially when i recollect all  the circumstances  for though i bragged of there being no love in  my history  there was when i was a goose or a gosling of about  eighteen  just your age  belinda  i think  something very like love  playing about my heart  or my head  there was a certain henry percival   a clarence hervey of a man  no  he had ten times the sense  begging your  pardon  of clarence hervey  his misfortune  or mine  was  that he had  too much sense  he was in love with me  but not with my faults  now i   wisely considering that my faults were the greatest part of me  insisted  upon his being in love with my faults  he wouldn t  or couldn t  i said  wouldn t  he said couldn t  i had been used to see the men about me lick  the dust at my feet  for it was gold dust  percival made wry faces  lord  delacour made none  i pointed him out to percival as an example  it was  an example he would not follow  i was provoked  and i married in hopes  of provoking the man i loved  the worst of it was  i did not provoke  him as much as i expected  six months afterwards i heard of his marriage  with a very amiable woman  i hate those  very amiable women   poor  percival  i should have been a very happy woman  i fancy  if i had  married you  for i believe you were the only man who ever really loved  me  but all that is over now   where were we  o  i married my lord  delacour  knowing him to be a fool  and believing that  for this reason   i should find no trouble in governing him  but what a fatal mistake  a  fool  of all animals in the creation  is the most difficult to govern   we set out in the fashionable world with a mutual desire to be as  extravagant as possible  strange  that with this similarity of taste we  could never agree   strange  that this similarity of taste was the cause  of our perpetual quarrels  during the first year of our marriage  i had  always the upper hand in these disputes  and the last word  and i was  content  stubborn as the brute was  i thought i should in time break him  in  from the specimens you have seen  you may guess that i was even then  a tolerable proficient in the dear art of  tormenting   i had almost  gained my point  just broken my lord s heart  when one fair morning i  unluckily told his man champfort that he knew no more how to cut hair  than a sheep shearer  champfort  who is conceit personified  took mortal  offence at this  and the devil  who is always at hand to turn anger into  malice  put it into champfort s head to put it into my lord s head  that  the world thought    my lady governed him    my lord took fire  they  say the torpedo  the coldest of cold creatures  sometimes gives out  a spark  i suppose when electrified with anger  the next time that  innocent i insisted upon my lord delacour s doing or not doing  i forget  which  the most reasonable thing in the world  my lord turns short  round  and answers   my lady delacour  i am not a man to be governed by  a wife    and from that time to this the words   i am not a man to be  governed by a wife   have been written in his obstinate face  as all the  world who can read the human countenance may see  my dear  i laugh  but  even in the midst of laughter there is sadness  but you don t know  what it is  i hope you never may  to have an obstinate fool for a bosom  friend      i at first flattered myself that my lord s was not an inveterate   incurable malady  but from his obvious weakness  i might have seen  that there was no hope  for cases of obstinacy are always dangerous in  proportion to the weakness of the patient  my lord s case was desperate   kill or cure was my humane or prudent maxim  i determined to try the  poison of jealousy  by way of an alterative  i had long kept it in petto  as my ultimate remedy  i fixed upon a proper subject  a man with whom  i thought that i could coquette to all eternity  without any danger to  myself  a certain colonel lawless  as empty a coxcomb as you would  wish to see  the world  said i to myself  can never be so absurd as to  suspect lady delacour with such a man as this  though her lord may   and will  for nothing is too absurd for him to believe  half my theory  proved just  that is saying a great deal for any theory  my lord  swallowed the remedy that i had prepared for him with an avidity and a  bonhommie which it did me good to behold  my remedy operated beyond my  most sanguine expectations  the poor man was cured of his obstinacy  and  became stark mad with jealousy  then indeed i had some hopes of him   for a madman can be managed  a fool cannot  in a month s time i made him  quite docile  with a face longer than the weeping philosopher s  he came  to me one morning  and assured me   he would do every thing i pleased   provided i would consult my own honour and his  and give up colonel  lawless        give up    i could hardly forbear laughing at the expression  i  replied   that as long as my lord treated me with becoming respect  i  had never in thought or deed given him just cause of complaint  but that  i was not a woman to be insulted  or to be kept  as i had hitherto  been  in leading strings by a husband   my lord  flattered as i meant he  should be with the idea that it was possible he should be suspected of  keeping a wife in leading strings  fell to making protestations   he  hoped his future conduct would prove    c  upon this hint  i gave the  reins to my imagination  and full drive i went into a fresh career  of extravagance  if i were checked  it was  an insult   and i began  directly to talk of  leading strings   this ridiculous game i played  successfully enough for some time  till at length  though naturally  rather slow at calculation  he actually discovered  that if we lived at  the rate of twenty thousand a year  and had only ten thousand a year to  spend  we should in due time have nothing left  this notable discovery  he communicated to me one morning  after a long preamble  when he had  finished prosing  i agreed that it was demonstrably just that he should  retrench  his  expenses  but that it was equally unjust and impossible  that i could make any reformation in  my  civil list  that economy was a  word which i had never heard of in my life till i married his lordship   that  upon second recollection  it was true i had heard of such a thing  as national economy  and that it would be a very pretty  though rather  hackneyed topic of declamation for a maiden speech in the house of  lords  i therefore advised him to reserve all he had to say upon the  subject for the noble lord upon the woolsack  nay  i very graciously  added  that upon this condition i would go to the house myself to give  his arguments and eloquence a fair hearing  and that i would do my best  to keep myself awake  this was all mighty playful and witty  but it  happened that my lord delacour  who never had any great taste for wit   could not this unlucky morning at all relish it  of course i grew  angry  and reminded him  with an indelicacy which his want of generosity  justified  that an heiress  who had brought a hundred thousand pounds  into his family  had some right to amuse herself  and that it was not my  fault if elegant amusements were more expensive than others      then came a long criminating and recriminating chapter  it was    my lord  your newmarket blunders    my lady  your cursed   theatricals     my lord  i have surely a right   and   my lady  i have  surely as good a right       but  my dear belinda  however we might pay one another  we could not  pay all the world with words  in short  after running through thousands  and tens of thousands  we were actually in distress for money  then  came selling of lands  and i don t know what devices for raising  money  according to the modes of lawyers and attorneys  it was quite  indifferent to me how they got money  provided they did get it  by what  art these gentlemen raised money  i never troubled myself to inquire  it  might have been the black art  for any thing i know to the contrary  i  know nothing of business  so i signed all the papers they brought to me   and i was mighty well pleased to find  that by so easy an expedient as  writing  t  c  h  delacour   i could command money at will  i signed   and signed  till at last i was with all due civility informed that my  signature was no longer worth a farthing  and when i came to inquire  into the cause of this phenomenon  i could nowise understand what my  lord delacour s lawyer said to me  he was a prig  and i had not patience  either to listen to him or to look at him  i sent for an old uncle of  mine  who used to manage all my money matters before i was married   i put the uncle and the lawyer into a room  together with their  parchments  to fight the matter out  or to come to a right understanding  if they could  the last  it seems  was quite impossible  in the course  of half an hour  out comes my uncle in such a rage  i never shall forget  his face  all the bile in his body had gotten into it  he had literally  no whites to his eyes   my dear uncle   said i   what is the matter   why  you are absolutely gold stick in waiting        no matter what i am  child   said the uncle   i ll tell you what you  are  with all your wit  a dupe   tis a shame for a woman of your sense  to be such a fool  and to know nothing of business  and if you knew  nothing yourself  could not you send for me        i was too ignorant to know that i know nothing   said i  but i will  not trouble you with all the said i s and said he s  i was made to  understand  that if lord delacour were to die the next day  i should  live a beggar  upon this i grew serious  as you may imagine  my uncle  assured me that i had been grossly imposed upon by my lord and his  lawyer  and that i had been swindled out of my senses  and out of my  dower  i repeated all that my uncle said  very faithfully  to lord  delacour  and all that either he or his lawyer could furnish out by  way of answer was  that  necessity had no law   necessity  it must be  allowed  though it might be the mother of law  was never with my lord  the mother of invention  having now found out that i had a good right to  complain  i indulged myself in it most gloriously  in short  my dear  we  had a comfortable family quarrel  love quarrels are easily made up  but  of money quarrels there is no end  from the moment these money quarrels  commenced  i began to hate lord delacour  before  i had only despised  him  you can have no notion to what meanness extravagance reduces men   i have known lord delacour shirk  and look so shabby  and tell so many  lies to people about a hundred guineas  a hundred guineas   what do i  say   about twenty  ten  five  o  my dear  i cannot bear the thoughts of  it      but i was going on to tell you  that my good uncle and all my relations  quarrelled with me for having ruined myself  as they said  but i said  they quarrelled with me for fear i should ask them for some of their    vile trash    accordingly  i abused and ridiculed them  one and all   and for my pains  all my acquaintance said  that  lady delacour was a  woman of a vast deal of spirit       we were relieved from our money embarrassments by the timely death of a  rich nobleman  to whose large estate my lord delacour was heir at law  i  was intoxicated with the idle compliments of all my acquaintance  and  i endeavoured to console myself for misery at home by gaiety abroad   ambitious of pleasing universally  i became the worst of slaves   a  slave to the world  not a moment of my time was at my own disposal  not  one of my actions  i may say  not one of my thoughts was my own  i was  obliged to find things  charming  every hour  which tired me to death   and every day it was the same dull round of hypocrisy and dissipation   you wonder to hear me speak in this manner  belinda  but one must speak  the truth sometimes  and this is what i have been saying to harriot  freke continually  for these ten years past  then why persist in the  same kind of life  you say  why  my dear  because i could not stop  i  was fit for this kind of life and for no other  i could not be happy at   home   for what sort of a companion could i have made of lord delacour   by this time he was tired of his horse potatoe  and his horse highflyer   and his horse eclipse  and goliah  and jenny grey   c   and he had taken  to hard drinking  which soon turned him  as you see  quite into a beast      i forgot to tell you that i had three children during the first five  years of my marriage  the first was a boy  he was born dead  and my  lord  and all his odious relations  laid the blame upon me  because i  would not be kept prisoner half a year by an old mother of his  a vile  cassandra  who was always prophesying that my child would not be born  alive  my second child was a girl  but a poor diminutive  sickly thing   it was the fashion at this time for fine mothers to suckle their own  children  so much the worse for the poor brats  fine nurses never made  fine children  there was a prodigious rout made about the matter  a vast  deal of sentiment and sympathy  and compliments and inquiries  but after  the novelty was over  i became heartily sick of the business  and at the  end of about three months my poor child was sick too  i don t much like  to think of it  it died  if i had put it out to nurse  i should have  been thought by my friends an unnatural mother  but i should have saved  its life  i should have bewailed the loss of the infant more  if lord  delacour s relations and my own had not made such lamentations upon the  occasion that i was stunned  i couldn t or wouldn t shed a tear  and i  left it to the old dowager to perform in public  as she wished  the part  of chief mourner  and to comfort herself in private by lifting up her  hands and eyes  and railing at me as the most insensible of mothers  all  this time i suffered more than she did  but that is what she shall  never have the satisfaction of knowing  i determined  that if ever i  had another child  i would not have the barbarity to nurse it myself   accordingly when my third child  a girl  was born  i sent it off  immediately to the country  to a stout  healthy  broad faced nurse   under whose care it grew and flourished  so that at three years old   when it was brought back to me  i could scarcely believe the chubby  little thing was my own child  the same reasons which convinced me i  ought not to nurse my own child  determined me   a plus forte raison    not to undertake its education  lord delacour could not bear the  child  because it was not a boy  the girl was put under the care of a  governess  who plagued my heart out with her airs and tracasseries for  three or four years  at the end of which time  as she turned out to be  lord delacour s mistress in form  i was obliged  in form  to beg she  would leave my house  and i put her pupil into better hands  i hope  at  a celebrated academy for young ladies  there she will  at any rate  be  better instructed than she could be at home  i beg your pardon  my  dear  for this digression on nursing and schooling  but i wanted only  to explain to you why it was that  when i was weary of the business  i  still went on in a course of dissipation  you see i had nothing at home   either in the shape of husband or children  to engage my affections   i believe it was this  aching void  in my heart which made me  after  looking abroad some time for a bosom friend  take such a prodigious  fancy to mrs  freke  she was just then coming into fashion  she struck  me  the first time i met her  as being downright ugly  but there was a  wild oddity in her countenance which made one stare at her  and she  was delighted to be stared at  especially by me  so we were mutually  agreeable to each other  i as starer  and she as staree  harriot freke  had  without comparison  more assurance than any man or woman i ever  saw  she was downright brass  but of the finest kind  corinthian brass   she was one of the first who brought what i call  harum scarum  manners  into fashion  i told you that she had assurance   impudence  i should  have called it  for no other word is strong enough  such things as  i have heard harriot freke say    you will not believe it  but her  conversation at first absolutely made me  like an old fashioned fool   wish i had a fan to play with  but  to my astonishment  all this  took   surprisingly with a set of fashionable young men  i found it necessary  to  reform  my manners  if i had not taken heart of grace  and  publicly abjured the heresies of  false delicacy   i should have been  excommunicated  lady delacour s sprightly elegance  allow me to speak  of myself in the style in which the newspaper writers talk of me  lady  delacour s sprightly elegance was but pale  not to say  faded  pink   compared with the scarlet of mrs  freke s dashing audacity  as my rival   she would on certain ground have beat me hollow  it was therefore good  policy to make her my friend  we joined forces  and nothing could stand  against us  but i have no right to give myself credit for good policy in  forming this intimacy  i really followed the dictates of my heart or my  imagination  there was a frankness in harriot s manner which i mistook  for artlessness of character  she spoke with such unbounded freedom on  certain subjects  that i gave her credit for unbounded sincerity on all  subjects  she had the talent of making the world believe  that  virtue  to be invulnerable by nature which disdained the common outworks of art  for its defence  i  amongst others  took it for granted  that the woman  who could make it her sport to  touch the brink of all we hate   must  have a stronger head than other people  i have since been convinced   however  of my mistake  i am persuaded that few can touch the brink  without tumbling headlong down the precipice  don t apply this  my  dear   literally   to the person of whom we were speaking  i am not base  enough to betray her secrets  however i may have been provoked by her  treachery  of her character and history you shall hear nothing but what  is necessary for my own justification  the league of amity between  us was scarcely ratified before my lord delacour came  with his wise  remonstrating face  to beg me  to consider what was due to my own honour  and his   like the cosmogony man in the vicar of wakefield  he came out  over and over with this cant phrase  which had once stood him in stead    do you think  my lord   said i   that because i gave up poor lawless  to oblige you  i shall give up all common sense to suit myself to your  taste  harriot freke is visited by every body but old dowagers and old  maids  i am neither an old dowager nor an old maid  the consequence is  obvious  my lord   pertness in dialogue  my dear  often succeeds better  with my lord than wit  i therefore saved the sterling gold  and bestowed  upon him nothing but counters  i tell you this to save the credit of my  taste and judgment      but to return to my friendship for harriot freke  i  of course   repeated to her every word which had passed between my husband and me   she out heroded herod upon the occasion  and laughed so much at what she  called my folly in  pleading guilty  in the lawless cause  that i  was downright ashamed of myself  and  purely to prove my innocence  i  determined  upon the first convenient opportunity  to renew my intimacy  with the colonel  the opportunity which i so ardently desired of  redeeming my independence was not long wanting  lawless  as my stars   which you know are always more in fault than ourselves  would have it   returned just at this time from the continent  where he had been with  his regiment  he returned with a wound across his forehead and a black  fillet  which made him look something more like a hero  and ten times  more like a coxcomb  than ever  he was in fashion  at all events  and  amongst other ladies  mrs  luttridge  odious mrs  luttridge  smiled  upon him  the colonel  however  had taste enough to know the difference  between smile and smile  he laid himself and his laurels at my feet  and  i carried him and them about in triumph  wherever i went  especially  to mrs  luttridge s  envy and scandal joined hands to attack me  and i  heard wondering and whispering wherever i went  i had no object in view  but to provoke my husband  therefore  conscious of the purity of my  intentions  it was my delight to brave the opinion of the wondering  world  i gave myself no concern about the effect my coquetry might have  upon the object of this flirtation  poor lawless  heart  i took it for  granted  he had none  how should a coxcomb come by a heart  vanity i  knew he had in abundance  but this gave me no alarm  as i thought that  if it should ever make him forget him self  i mean forget what was due  to me  i could  by one flash of my wit  strike him to the earth   or blast him for ever  one night we had been together at mrs   luttridge s   she  amongst other good things  kept a faro bank  and  i  am convinced  cheated  be that as it may  i lost an immensity of money   and it was my pride to lose with as much gaiety as any body else could  win  so i was  or appeared to be  in uncommonly high spirits  and  lawless had his share of my good humour  we left mrs  luttridge s  together early  about half past one  as the colonel was going to hand me  to my carriage  a smart looking young man  as i thought  came up close  to the coach door  and stared me full in the face  i was not a woman to  be disconcerted at such a thing as this  but i really was startled when  the young fellow jumped into the carriage after me  i thought he was  mad  i had only courage enough to scream  lawless seized hold of the  intruder to drag him out  and out he dragged the youth  exclaiming  in a  high tone   what is the meaning of all this  sir  who the devil are  you  my name s lawless  who the devil are you   the answer to this was a  convulsion of laughter  by the laugh i knew it to be harriot freke   who  am i  only a freke   cried she   shake hands   i gave her my hand  into  the carriage she sprang  and desired the colonel to follow her  lawless  laughed  we all laughed  and drove away   where do you think i ve been    said harriot   in the gallery of the house of commons  almost squeezed  to death these four hours  but i swore i d hear sheridan s speech  to night  and i did  betted fifty guineas i would with mrs  luttridge   and have won  fun and freke for ever  huzza   harriot was mad with  spirits  and so noisy and unmanageable  that  as i told her  i was sure  she was drunk  lawless  in his silly way  laughed incessantly  and i was  so taken up with her oddities  that  for some time  i did not perceive  we were going the lord knows where  till  at last  when the  larum of  harriot s voice ceased for an instant  i was struck with the strange  sound of the carriage   where are we  not upon the stones  i m sure    said i  and putting my head out of the window  i saw we were beyond the  turnpike   the coachman s drunk as well as you  harriot   said i  and  i was going to pull the string to stop him  but harriot had hold of it    the man is going very right   said she   i ve told him where to go  now  don t fancy that lawless and i are going to run away with you  all this  is unnecessary now a days  thank god   to this i agreed  and laughed for  fear of being ridiculous   guess where you are going   said harriot  i  guessed and guessed  but could not guess right  and my merry companions  were infinitely diverted with my perplexity and impatience  more  especially as  i believe  in spite of all my efforts  i grew rather  graver than usual  we went on to the end of sloane street  and quite  out of town  at last we stopped  it was dark  the footman s flambeau was  out  i could only just see by the lamps that we were at the door of  a lone  odd looking house  the house door opened  and an old woman  appeared with a lantern in her hand       where is this farce  or freak  or whatever you call it  to end   said  i  as harriot pulled me into the dark passage along with her      alas  my dear belinda   said lady delacour  pausing   i little foresaw  where or how it was to end  but i am not come yet to the tragical part  of my story  and as long as i can laugh i will  as the old woman and her  miserable light went on before us  i could almost have thought of sir  bertrand  or of some german  horrifications   but i heard lawless  who  never could help laughing at the wrong time  bursting behind me  with a  sense of his own superiority       now you will learn your destiny  lady delacour   said harriot  in a  solemn tone       yes  from the celebrated mrs  w      the modern dealer in art magic    said i  laughing   for  now i guess whereabouts i am  colonel lawless s  laugh broke the spell  harriot freke  never whilst you live expect to  succeed in  the sublime    harriot swore at the colonel for the veriest   spoil sport  she had ever seen  and she whispered to me   the reason he  laughs is because he is afraid of our suspecting the truth of him  that  he believes  tout de bon  in conjuration  and the devil  and all that    the old woman  whose cue i found was to be dumb  opened a door at the  top of a narrow staircase  and pointing to a tall figure  completely  enveloped in fur  left us to our fate  i will not trouble you with  a pompous description of all the mummery of the scene  my dear  as i  despair of being able to frighten you out of your wits  i should have  been downright angry with harriot freke for bringing me to such a place   but that i knew women of the first fashion had been with mrs  w      before us  some in sober sadness  some by way of frolic  so as there  was no fear of being ridiculous  there was no shame  you know  and my  conscience was quite at ease  harriot had no conscience  so she was  always at ease  and never more so than in male attire  which she had  been told became her particularly  she supported the character of  a young rake with such spirit and  truth   that i am sure no common  conjuror could have discovered any thing feminine about her  she rattled  on with a set of nonsensical questions  and among other things she  asked   how soon will lady delacour marry again after her lord s death        she will never marry after her lord s death   answered the oracle    then she will marry during his lifetime   said harriot   true    answered the oracle  colonel lawless laughed  i was angry  and the  colonel would have been quiet  for he was a gentleman  but there was no  such thing as managing mrs  freke  who  though she had laid aside the  modesty of her own sex  had not acquired the decency of the other   who  is to be lady delacour s second husband   cried she   you ll not offend  any of the present company by naming the man    her second husband  i cannot name   replied the oracle   but let her beware of a lawless  lover   mrs  freke and colonel lawless  encouraged by her  triumphed  over me without mercy  i may say  without shame  well  my dear  i am in  a hurry to have done with all this  though i   doted upon folly    yet i  was terrified at the thoughts of any thing worse  the idea of a divorce   the public brand of a shameful life  shocked me in spite of all my real  and all my assumed levity  o that i had  at this instant  dared to   be myself   but my fear of ridicule was greater than my fear of vice    bless me  my dear lady delacour   whispered harriot  as we left this  house   what can make you in such a desperate hurry to get home  you  gape and fidget  one would think you had never sat up a night before in  your life  i verily believe you are afraid to trust yourself with us   which of us are you afraid of  lawless  or me  or  yourself    there was  a tone of contempt in the last words which piqued me to the quick  and  however strange it may seem  i was now anxious only to convince harriot  that i was not afraid of myself  false shame made me act as if i had no  shame  you would not suspect me of knowing any thing of false shame  but  depend upon it  my dear  many  who appear to have as much assurance as  i have  are secretly its slaves  i moralize  because i am come to a part  of my story which i should almost be glad to omit  but i promised you  that there should be no sins of omission  it was light  but not broad  daylight  when we got to knightsbridge  lawless  encouraged  for i  cannot deny it  by the levity of my manner  as well as of harriot s   was in higher and more familiar spirits than i ever saw him  mrs   freke desired me to set her down at her sister s  who lived in  grosvenor place  i did so  and i beg you to believe that i was in an  agony  to get rid of my colonel at the same time  but you know i could  not  before harriot freke  absolutely say to him   get out   indeed  to  tell things as they were  it was scarcely possible to guess by my manner  that i was under any anxiety  i acted my part so well  or so ill  as  harriot freke jumped out of the coach  a cock crowed in the area of her  sister s house   there   cried harriot   do you hear the cock crow   lady delacour  now it s to be hoped your fear of goblins is over  else  i would not be so cruel as to leave the pretty dear all alone    all  alone   answered i   your friend the colonel is much obliged to you  for making nobody of him    my friend the colonel   whispered harriot   leaning with her bold masculine arms on the coach door   my friend  the colonel is much obliged to me  i m sure  for remembering what the  cunning or the knowing woman told us just now  so when i said i left  you alone  i was not guilty of a bull  was i   i had the grace to be  heartily ashamed of this speech  and called out  in utter confusion   to  berkley square  but where shall i set you down  colonel  harriot  good  morning  don t forget you are in man s clothes   i did not dare to  repeat the question of  where shall i set you down  colonel   at this  instant  because harriot gave me such an arch  sneering look  as much as  to say   still afraid of yourself   we drove on  i m persuaded that the  confusion which  in spite of all my efforts  broke through my affected  levity  encouraged lawless  who was naturally a coxcomb and a fool   to believe that i was actually his  else he never could have been so  insolent  in short  my dear  before we had got through the turnpike  gate  i was downright obliged to say to him   get out   which i did with  a degree of indignation that quite astonished him  he muttered something  about ladies knowing their minds  and i own  though i went off with  flying colours  i secretly blamed myself as much as i did him  and i  blamed harriot more than i did either  i sent for her the next day  as  soon as i could  to consult her  she expressed such astonishment  and  so much concern at this catastrophe of our night s frolic  and blamed  herself with so many oaths  and execrated lawless for a coxcomb  so much  to the ease and satisfaction of my conscience  that i was confirmed  in my good opinion of her  and indeed felt for her the most lively  affection and esteem  for observe  with me esteem ever followed  affection  instead of affection following esteem  woe be to all who in  morals preposterously put the cart before the horse  but to proceed  with my history  all fashionable historians stop to make reflections   supposing that no one else can have the sense to make any  my  esteemed   friend agreed with me that it would be best for all parties concerned  to hush up this business  that as lawless was going out of town in a few  days  to be elected for a borough  we should get rid of him in the  best way possible  without  more last words   that he had been punished  sufficiently on the spot  and that to punish twice for the same offence   once in private and once in public  would be contrary to the laws of  englishmen and englishwomen  and in my case would be contrary to the  evident dictates of prudence  because i could not complain without  calling upon lord delacour to call lawless out  this i could not do  without acknowledging that his lordship had been in the right  in  warning me about his  honour and my own   which old phrase i dreaded to  hear for the ninety ninth time  besides  lord delacour was the last man  in the world i should have chosen for my knight  though unluckily he was  my lord  besides  all things considered  i thought the whole story might  not tell so well in the world for me  tell it which way i would  we  therefore agreed that it would be most expedient to hold our tongues  we  took it for granted that lawless would hold his  and as for my people   they knew nothing  i thought  or if they did  i was sure of them  how  the thing got abroad i could not at the time conceive  though now i am  well acquainted with the baseness and treachery of the woman i called my  friend  the affair was known and talked of every where the next day   and the story was told especially at odious mrs  luttridge s  with  such exaggerations as drove me almost mad  i was enraged  inconceivably  enraged with lawless  from whom i imagined the reports originated      i was venting my indignation against him in a room full of company   where i had just made my story good  when a gentleman  to whom i was  a stranger  came in breathless  with the news that colonel lawless was  killed in a duel by lord delacour  that they were carrying him home to  his mother s  and that the body was just going by the door  the company  all crowded to the windows immediately  and i was left standing alone  till i could stand no longer  what was said or done after this i do  not remember  i only know that when i came to myself  the most dreadful  sensation i ever experienced was the certainty that i had the blood of a  fellow creature to answer for   i wonder   said lady delacour  breaking  off at this part of her history  and rising suddenly   i wonder what  is become of marriott   surely it is time for me to have my drops   miss portman  have the goodness to ring  for i  must  have something  immediately   belinda was terrified at the wildness of her manner  lady  delacour became more composed  or put more constraint upon herself  at  the sight of marriott  marriott brought from the closet in her lady s  room the drops  which lady delacour swallowed with precipitation  then  she ordered coffee  and afterward chasse cafe  and at last  turning to  belinda  with a forced smile  she said       now shall the princess scheherazade go on with her story            chapter iv     lady delacour s history continued        i left off with the true skill of a good story teller  at the most  interesting part  a duel  and yet duels are so common now that they are  really vulgar incidents      but we think that a duel concerning ourselves must be more  extraordinary than any other  we hear of men being shot in duels about  nothing every day  so it is really a weakness in me to think so much  about poor lawless s death  as harriot freke said to me at the time  she  expected to see me show sorrow in  public   but very fortunately for  me  she roused my pride  which was always stronger than my reason  and i  behaved myself upon the occasion as became a fine lady  there were some  things  however  i could hardly stand  you must know that lawless  fool  and coxcomb as he was  had some magnanimity  and showed it  as some  people do from whom it is least expected  on his death bed  the last  words he said were   lady delacour is innocent  i charge you  don t  prosecute lord delacour   this he said to his mother  who  to complete  my misery  is one of the most respectable women in england  and was  most desperately fond of lawless  who was an only son  she never has  recovered his loss  do you remember asking me who a tall elderly lady in  mourning was  that you saw getting into her carriage one day  at south  audley street chapel  as we passed by in our way to the park  that was  lady lawless  i believe i didn t answer you at the time  i meet her  every now and then  to me a spectre of dismay  but  as harriot freke  said  certainly such a man as poor lawless was a useless being in  society  however he may be regretted by a doting mother  we should see  things in a philosophical light  if we can  i should not have suffered  half as much as i did if he had been a man of a stronger understanding   but he was a poor  vain  weak creature  that i actually drew on and  duped with my own coquetry  whilst all the time i was endeavouring only  to plague lord delacour  i was punished enough by the airs his  lordship doubly gave himself  upon the strength of his valour and his  judgment  they roused me completely  and i blamed him with all my might   and got an enormous party of my friends  i mean my acquaintance  to  run him down full cry  for having fought for me  it was absurd  it was  rash  it was want of proper confidence in his wife   thus we  said  lord  delacour had his partisans  it is true  amongst whom the loudest was  odious mrs  luttridge  i embraced the first opportunity i met with of  retaliation  you must know that mrs  luttridge  besides being a great  faro player  was a great dabbler in politics  for she was almost as fond  of power as of money  she talked loud and fluently  and had  somehow or  other  partly by intriguing  partly by relationship  connected herself  with some of the leading men in parliament  there was to be a contested  election in our country  mr  luttridge had a good estate there next  to lord delacour s  and being of an ancient family  and keeping a good  table  the luttridges were popular enough  at the first news of an  election  out comes a flaming advertisement from mr  luttridge  away  posted mrs  luttridge to begin her canvass  and away posted lady  delacour after her  to canvass for a cousin of harriot freke  this was a  new scene for me  but i piqued myself on the versatility of my talents   and i laid myself out in please all the squires  and  what was more  difficult  all the squires  ladies  in     shire  i was ambitious to  have it said of me   that i was the finest figure that ever appeared  upon a canvass   o  ye     shireians  how hard did i work to obtain your  praise  all that the combined force of vanity and hatred could inspire  i performed  and with success  you have but little curiosity  i presume   to know how many hogsheads of port went down the throat of john bull  or  how many hecatombs were offered up to the genius of english liberty  my  hatred to mrs  luttridge was  of course  called love of my country  lady  delacour was deified by all  true  patriots  and  luckily  a handsome  legacy left me for my spirit  by an uncle who died six weeks before the  election  enabled us to sustain the expense of my apotheosis  the day of  election came  harriot freke and i made our appearance on the hustings   dressed in splendid party uniforms  and before us our knights and  squires held two enormous panniers full of ribands and cockades  which  we distributed with a grace that won all hearts  if not all votes  mrs   luttridge thought the panniers would carry the election  and forthwith  she sent off an express for a pair of panniers twice as large as ours  i  took out my pencil  and drew a caricature of  the ass and her panniers    wrote an epigram at the bottom of it  and the epigram and the caricature  were soon in the hands of half     shire  the verses were as bad as  impromptus usually are  and the drawing was not much better than  the writing  but the  good will  of the critics supplied all my  deficiencies  and never was more praise bestowed upon the pen of burke   or the pencil of reynolds  than was lavished upon me by my honest  friends  my dear belinda  if you will not quarrel with the quality  you  may have what quantity of praise you please  mrs  luttridge  as i hoped  and expected  was beyond measure enraged at the sight of the caricature  and epigram  she was  besides being a gamester and a politician  what do  you think   an excellent shot  she wished  she said  to be a man  that  she might be qualified to take proper notice of my conduct  the same  kind friends who showed her my epigram repeated to me her observation  upon it  harriot freke was at my elbow  and offered to take any   message  i might think proper to mrs  luttridge  i scarcely thought her  in earnest till she added  that the only way left now a days for a woman  to distinguish herself was by spirit  as every thing else was grown   cheap and vulgar in the eyes of men   that she knew one of the  cleverest young men in england  and a man of fashion into the bargain   who was just going to publish a treatise  upon the propriety and  necessity of female duelling   and that he had demonstrated  beyond  a possibility of doubt  that civilized society could not exist half  a century longer without this necessary improvement  i had prodigious  deference for the masculine superiority  as i thought it  of harriot s  understanding  she was a philosopher  and a fine lady  i was only a fine  lady  i had never fired a pistol in my life  and i was a little inclined  to cowardice  but harriot offered to bet any wager upon the steadiness  of my hand  and assured me that i should charm all beholders in male  attire  in short  as my second  if i would furnish her with proper  credentials  she swore she would undertake to furnish me with clothes   and pistols  and courage  and every thing i wanted  i sat down to pen  my challenge  when i was writing it  my hand did not tremble  much   not  more than my lord delacour s always does  the challenge was very  prettily worded  i believe i can repeat it       lady delacour presents her compliments to mrs  luttridge  she is  informed that mrs  l     wishes she were a man  that she might be  qualified to take  proper  notice of lady d     s conduct  lady delacour  begs leave to assure mrs  luttridge  that though she has the misfortune  to be a woman  she is willing to account for her conduct in any manner  mrs  l     may think proper  and at any hour and place she may appoint   lady d     leaves the choice of the weapons to mrs  l      mrs  h   freke  who has the honour of presenting this note  is lady delacour s   friend  upon this occasion       i cannot repeat mrs  luttridge s answer  all i know is  it was not half  as neatly worded as my note  but the essential part of it was  that she  accepted my challenge  with pleasure   and should do herself the honour  of meeting me at six o clock the next morning  that miss honour o grady  would be her  friend  upon the occasion  and that pistols were the  weapons she preferred  the place of appointment was behind an old barn   about two miles from the town of       the hour was fixed to be early in  the morning  to prevent all probability of interruption  in the evening   harriot and i rode to the ground  there were several bullets sticking in  the posts of the barn  this was the place where mrs  luttridge had been  accustomed to exercise herself in firing at a mark  i own my courage   oozed out  a little at this sight  the duke de la rochefoucault  i  believe  said truly  that  many would be cowards if they dared   there  seemed to me to be no physical and less moral necessity for my fighting  this duel  but i did not venture to reason on a point of honour with  my spirited second  i bravadoed to harriot most magnanimously  but at  night  when marriott was undressing me  i could not forbear giving her  a hint  which i thought might tend to preserve the king s peace  and  the peace of the county  i went to the ground in the morning in good  spirits  and with a safe conscience  harriot was in admiration of my   lion port   and  to do her justice  she conducted herself with great  coolness upon the occasion  but then it may be observed  that it was i  who was to stand fire  and not she  i thought of poor lawless a billion  of times  at least  as we were going to the ground  and i had my  presentiments  and my confused notions of poetic justice  but poetic  justice  and all other sorts of justice  went clear out of my head  when  i saw my antagonist and her friend  actually pistol in hand  waiting for  us  they were both in men s clothes  i secretly called upon the name of  marriott with fervency  and i looked round with more anxiety than ever  bluebeard s wife  or  anne  sister anne   looked to see if any body  was coming  nothing was to be seen but the grass blown by the wind  no  marriott to throw herself  toute eploree  between the combatants  no  peace officers to bind us over to our good behaviour  no deliverance at  hand  and mrs  luttridge  by all the laws of honour  as challenged  was  to have the first shot  oh  those laws of honour  i was upon the point  of making an apology  in spite of them all  when  to my inexpressible  joy  i was relieved from the dreadful alternative of being shot through  the head  or of becoming a laughing stock for life  by an incident  less  heroic  i ll grant you  than opportune  but you shall have the whole  scene  as well as i can recollect it   as well   for those who for the  first time go into a field of battle do not  as i am credibly informed  and internally persuaded  always find the clearness of their memories  improved by the novelty of their situation  mrs  luttridge  when we came  up  was leaning  with a truly martial negligence  against the wall of  the barn  with her pistol  as i told you  in her hand  she spoke not  a word  but her second  miss honour o grady  advanced towards us  immediately  and  taking off her hat very manfully  addressed herself  to my second   mistress harriot freke  i presume  if i mistake not    harriot bowed slightly  and answered   miss honour o grady  i presume   if i mistake not    the same  at your service   replied miss honour    i have a few words to suggest that may save a great deal of noise  and  bloodshed  and ill will    as to noise   said harriot   it is a thing in  which i delight  therefore i beg that mayn t be spared on my account  as  to bloodshed  i beg that may not be spared on lady delacour s account   for her honour  i am sure  is dearer to her than her blood  and  as to  ill will  i should be concerned to have that saved on mrs  luttridge s  account  as we all know it is a thing in which she delights  even more  than i do in noise  or lady delacour in blood  but pray proceed   miss honour o grady  you have a few words to suggest    yes  i would  willingly observe  as it is my duty to my  principal    said honour    that one who is compelled to fire her pistol with her left hand  though  ever so good a shot  naturally   is by no means on a footing with one  who has the advantage of her right hand   harriot rubbed my pistol with  the sleeve of her coat  and i  recovering my wit with my hopes of being  witty with impunity  answered   unquestionably  left handed wisdom and  left handed courage are neither of them the very best of their kinds   but we must content ourselves with them  if  we can have no other     that  if    cried honour o grady   is not  like most of the family of  the  ifs   a peace maker  my lady delacour  i was going to observe that  my principal has met with an unfortunate accident  in the shape of a  whitlow on the fore finger of her right hand  which incapacitates her  from drawing a trigger  but i am at your service  ladies  either of  you  that can t put up with a disappointment with good humour   i never   during the whole course of my existence  was more disposed to bear  a disappointment with good humour  to prove that i was incapable of  bearing malice  and to oblige the seconds  for form s sake  i agreed  that we should take our ground  and fire our pistols into the air  mrs   luttridge  with her left handed wisdom  fired first  and i  with great  magnanimity  followed her example  i must do my adversary s second  miss  honour o grady  the justice to observe  that in this whole affair she  conducted herself not only with the spirit  but with the good nature  and generosity characteristic of her nation  we met enemies  and parted  friends      life is a tragicomedy  though the critics will allow of no such thing  in their books  it is a true representation of what passes in the  world  and of all lives mine has been the most grotesque mixture  or  alternation  i should say  of tragedy and comedy  all this is apropos to  something i have not told you yet  this comic duel ended tragically  for me   how   you say  why   tis clear that i was not shot through the  head  but it would have been better  a hundred times better for me  if  i had  i should have been spared  in this life at least  the torments  of the damned  i was not used to priming and loading  my pistol was  overcharged  when i fired  it recoiled  and i received a blow on my  breast  the consequences of which you have seen      the pain was nothing at the moment compared with what i have since  experienced  but i will not complain till i cannot avoid it  i had not   at the time i received the blow  much leisure for lamentation  for i had  scarcely discharged my pistol when we heard a loud shout on the other  side of the barn  and a crowd of town s people  country people  and  haymakers  came pouring down the lane towards us  with rakes and  pitchforks in their hands  an english mob is really a formidable thing   marriott had mismanaged her business most strangely  she had  indeed   spread a report of a duel  a female duel  but the untutored sense of  propriety amongst these rustics was so shocked at the idea of a duel  fought by women in  men s clothes   that i verily believe they would  have thrown us into the river with all their hearts  stupid blockheads   i am convinced that they would not have been half so much scandalized  if we had boxed in petticoats  the want of these petticoats had nearly  proved our destruction  or at least our disgrace  a peeress after being  ducked  could never have held her head above water again with any grace   the mob had just closed round us  crying   shame  shame  shame   duck   em  duck  em  gentle or simple  duck  em  duck  em   when their  attention was suddenly turned towards a person who was driving up the  lane a large herd of squeaking  grunting pigs  the person was clad in  splendid regimentals  and he was armed with a long pole  to the end  of which hung a bladder  and his pigs were frightened  and they ran  squeaking from one side of the road to the other  and the pig driver  in regimentals  in the midst of the noise  could not without difficulty  make his voice heard  but at last he was understood to say  that a bet  of a hundred guineas depended upon his being able to keep these pigs  ahead of a flock of turkeys that were following them  and he begged the  mob to give him and his pigs fair play  at the news of this wager   and at the sight of the gentleman turned pig driver  the mob were in  raptures  and at the sound of his voice  harriot freke immediately  exclaimed   clarence hervey  by all that s lucky        clarence hervey   interrupted belinda   clarence hervey  my dear    said lady delacour  coolly   he can do every thing  you know  even drive  pigs  better than any body else   but let me go on      harriot freke shouted in a stentorian voice  which actually made your  pig driver start  she explained to him in french our distress  and the  cause of it  clarence was  as i suppose you have discovered long ago    that cleverest young man in england who had written on the propriety  and necessity of female duelling   he answered harriot in french   to  attempt your rescue by force would be vain  but i will do better  i  will make a diversion in your favour   immediately our hero  addressing  himself to the sturdy fellow who held me in custody  exclaimed   huzza   my boys  old england for ever  yonder comes a frenchman with a flock of  turkeys  my pigs will beat them  for a hundred guineas  old england for  ever  huzza       as he spoke  the french officer  with whom clarence hervey had laid the  wager  appeared at the turn of the lane  his turkeys half flying  half  hobbling up the road before him  the frenchman waved a red streamer over  the heads of his flock  clarence shook a pole  from the top of which  hung a bladder full of beans  the pigs grunted  the turkeys gobbled   and the mob shouted  eager for the fame of old england  the crowd  followed clarence with loud acclamations  the french officer was  followed with groans and hisses  so great was the confusion  and so  great the zeal of the patriots  that even the pleasure of ducking the  female duellists was forgotten in the general enthusiasm  all eyes and  all hearts were intent upon the race  and now the turkeys got foremost   and now the pigs  but when we came within sight of the horsepond  i  heard one man cry   don t forget the ducking   how i trembled  but our  knight shouted to his followers   for the love of old england  my brave  boys  keep between my pigs and the pond   if our pigs see the water   they ll run to it  and england s undone       the whole fury of the mob was by this speech conducted away from us    on  on  my boys  into town  to the market place  whoever gains the  market place first wins the day   our general shook the rattling bladder  in triumph over the heads of  the swinish multitude   and we followed in  perfect security in his train into the town      men  women  and children  crowded to the windows and doors   retreat  into the first place you can   whispered clarence to us  we were close  to him  harriot freke pushed her way into a milliner s shop  i could not  get in after her  for a frightened pig turned back suddenly  and almost  threw me down  clarence hervey caught me  and favoured my retreat into  the shop  but poor clarence lost his bet by his gallantry  whilst he  was manoeuvring in my favour  the turkeys got several yards ahead of the  pigs  and reaching the market place first  won the race      the french officer found great difficulty in getting safe out of the  town  but clarence represented to the mob that he was a prisoner on his  parole  and that it would be unlike englishmen to insult a prisoner  so  he got off without being pelted  and they both returned in safety to  the house of general y      where they were to dine  and where  they entertained a large party of officers with the account of this  adventure      mrs  freke and i rejoiced in our escape  and we thought that the whole  business was now over  but in this we were mistaken  the news of our  duel  which had spread in the town  raised such an uproar as had never  been heard  even at the noisiest election  would you believe it   the  fate of the election turned upon this duel  the common people  one and  all  declared that they would not vote either for mr  luttridge or mr   freke  because  as how   but i need not repeat all the  platitudes   that they said  in short  neither ribands nor brandy could bring them  to reason  with true english pig headedness  they went every man of them  and polled for an independent candidate of their own choosing  whose  wife  forsooth  was a proper behaved woman      the only thing i had to console me for all this was clarence hervey s  opinion that i looked better in man s clothes than my friend harriot  freke  clarence was charmed with my spirit and grace  but he had not  leisure at that time to attach himself seriously to me  or to any thing   he was then about nineteen or twenty  he was all vivacity  presumption   and paradox  he was enthusiastic in support of his opinions  but he was  at the same time the most candid man in the world  for there was no set  of tenets which could be called exclusively his  he adopted in liberal  rotation every possible absurdity  and  to do him justice  defended each  in its turn with the most ingenious arguments that could be devised  and  with a flow of words which charmed the ear  if not the sense  his essay  on female duelling was a most extraordinary performance  it was handed  about in manuscript till it was worn out  he talked of publishing it   and dedicating it to me  however  this scheme  amongst a million of  others  he  talked of   but never put into execution  luckily for him   many of his follies evaporated in words  i saw but little either of him  or his follies at this time  all i know about him is  that after he  had lost his bet of a hundred guineas  as a pig driver  by his  knight errantry in rescuing the female duellists from a mob  he wrote a  very charming copy of verses upon the occasion  and that he was so much  provoked by the stupidity of some of his brother officers who could not  understand the verses  that he took a disgust to the army  and sold his  commission  he set out upon a tour to the continent  and i returned with  harriot freke to london  and forgot the existence of such a person as  clarence hervey for three or four years  unless people can be of some  use  or unless they are actually present  let them be ever so agreeable  or meritorious  we are very apt to forget them  one grows strangely  selfish by living in the world   tis a perfect cure for romantic notions  of gratitude  and love  and so forth  if i had lived in the country  in an old manor house  clarence hervey would have doubtless reigned  paramount in my imagination as the deliverer of my life   c  but in  london one has no time for thinking of deliverers  and yet what i did  with my time i cannot tell you   tis gone  and no trace left  one day  after another went i know not how  had i wept for every day i lost  i m  sure i should have cried my eyes out before this time  if i had enjoyed  any amusement in the midst of this dissipation  it would all have been  very well  but i declare to you in confidence i have been tired to  death  nothing can be more monotonous than the life of a hackneyed fine  lady   i question whether a dray horse  or  a horse in a mill  would  willingly exchange places with one  if they could know as much of the  matter as i do  you are surprised at hearing all this from me  my dear  belinda  how i envy you  you are not yet tired of every thing   the  world  has still the gloss of novelty for you  but don t expect that can  last above a season  my first winter was certainly entertaining enough   one begins with being charmed with the bustle and glare  and what the  french call  spectacle   this is over  i think  in six months  i can but  just recollect having been amused at the theatres  and the opera  and  the pantheon  and ranelagh  and all those places  for their own sakes   soon  very soon  we go out to see people  not things  then we grow tired  of seeing people  then we grow tired of being seen by people  and then  we go out merely because we can t stay at home  a dismal story  and  a true one  excuse me for showing you the simple truth  well dressed  falsehood is a personage much more  presentable   i am now come to an  epoch in my history in which there is a dearth of extraordinary events   what shall i do  shall i invent  i would if i could  but i cannot  then  i must confess to you that during these last four years i should  have died of ennui if i had not been kept alive by my hatred of mrs   luttridge and of my husband  i don t know which i hate most  o  yes   i do  i certainly hate mrs  luttridge the most  for a woman can always  hate a woman more than she can hate a man  unless she has been in love  with him  which i never was with poor lord delacour  yes  i certainly  hate mrs  luttridge the most  i cannot count the number of extravagant  things i have done on purpose to eclipse her  we have had rival routs   rival concerts  rival galas  rival theatres  she has cost me more than   she s  worth  but then i certainly have mortified her once a month at  least  my hatred to mrs  luttridge  my dear  is the remote cause of  my love for you  for it was the cause of my intimacy with your aunt  stanhope   mrs  stanhope is really a clever woman  she knows how to turn  the hatred of all her friends and acquaintance to her own advantage   to  serve lovers is a thankless office compared with that of serving   haters   polite haters i mean  it may be dangerous  for aught i know   to interpose in the quarrels of those who hate their neighbours  not  only with all their souls  but with all their strength  the barbarians  fight it out  kiss  and are friends  the quarrels which never come to  blows are safer for a go between  but even these are not to be compared  to such as never come to words  your true silent hatred is that which  lasts for ever  the moment it was known that mrs  luttridge and i had  come to the resolution never to speak to one another  your aunt  stanhope began to minister to my hatred so  that she made herself quite  agreeable  she one winter gave me notice that my adversary had set her  heart upon having a magnificent entertainment on a particular day  on  that day i determined  of course  to have a rival gala  mrs  stanhope s  maid had a lover  a gardener  who lived at chelsea  and the gardener  had an aloe  which was expected soon to blow  now a plant that blows but  once in a hundred years is worth having  the gardener intended to make  a public exhibition of it  by which he expected to gain about a hundred  guineas  your aunt stanhope s maid got it from him for me for fifty  and  i had it whispered about that an aloe in full blow would stand in the  middle of one of lady delacour s supper tables  the difficulty was to  make mrs  luttridge fix upon the very day we wanted  for you know we  could not possibly put off the blowing of our aloe  your aunt stanhope  managed the thing admirably by means of a  common friend   who was not  a suspected person with the luttridges  in short  my dear  i gained my  point  every body came from mrs  luttridge s to me  or to my aloe  she  had a prodigiously fine supper  but scarcely a soul stayed with her   they all came to see what could be seen but once in a hundred years  now  the aloe  you know  is of a cumbersome height for a supper ornament  my  saloon luckily has a dome  and under the dome we placed it  round the  huge china vase in which it was planted we placed the most beautiful  or  rather the most expensive hothouse plants we could procure  after all   the aloe was an ugly thing  but it answered my purpose  it made mrs   luttridge  as i am credibly informed  absolutely weep with vexation  i  was excessively obliged to your aunt stanhope  and i assured her that if  ever it were in my power  she might depend upon my gratitude  pray  when  you write  repeat the same thing to her  and tell her that since she has  introduced belinda portman to me  i am a hundred times more obliged to  her than ever i was before      but to proceed with my important history   i will not tire you with  fighting over again all my battles in my seven years  war with mrs   luttridge  i believe love is more to your taste than hatred  therefore  i will go on as fast as possible to clarence hervey s return from his  travels  he was much improved by them  or at least i thought so  for he  was heard to declare  that after all he had seen in france and italy   lady delacour appeared to him the most charming woman   of her age    in europe  the words   of her age   piqued me  and i spared no pains to  make him forget them  a stupid man cannot readily be persuaded out of  his senses  what he sees he sees  and neither more nor less  but  tis  the easiest thing in the world to catch hold of a man of genius  you  have nothing to do but to appeal from his senses to his imagination  and  then he sees with the eyes of his imagination  and hears with the ears  of his imagination  and then no matter what the age  beauty  or wit of  the charmer may be  no matter whether it be lady delacour or belinda  portman  i think i know clarence hervey s character  au fin fond   and i  could lead him where i pleased  but don t be alarmed  my dear  you know  i can t lead him into matrimony  you look at me  and from me  and you  don t well know which way to look  you are surprised  perhaps  after  all that passed  all that i felt  and all that i still feel about poor  lawless  i should not be cured of coquetry  so am i surprised  but  habit  fashion  the devil  i believe  lead us on  and then  lord  delacour is so obstinate and jealous  you can t have forgotten the   polite conversation  that passed one morning at breakfast between his  lordship and me about clarence hervey  but neither does his lordship  know  nor does clarence hervey suspect  that my object with him is to  conceal from the world what i cannot conceal from myself  that i am a  dying woman  i am  and i see you think me  a strange  weak  inconsistent  creature  i was intended for something better  but now it is too late   a coquette i have lived  and a coquette i shall die  i speak frankly to  you  let me have the glory of leading clarence hervey about with me in  public for a few months longer  then i must quit the stage  as to love   you know with me that is out of the question  all i ask or wish for is  admiration      lady delacour paused  and leaned back on the sofa  she appeared in great  pain      oh   i am sometimes   resumed she   as you see  in terrible pain  for  two years after i gave myself that blow with the pistol  i neglected the  warning twinges that i felt from time to time  at last i was terrified   marriott was the only person to whom i mentioned my fears  and she was  profoundly ignorant  she flattered me with false hopes  till  alas  it  was in vain to doubt of the nature of my complaint  then she urged me  to consult a physician  that i would not do  i could not  i never will  consult a physician   i would not for the universe have my situation  known  you stare  you cannot enter into my feelings  why  my dear  if  i lose admiration  what have i left  would you have me live upon pity   consider what a dreadful thing it must be to me  who have no friends  no  family  to be confined to a sick room  a sick bed   tis what i must come  to at last  but not yet  not yet  i have fortitude  i should despise  myself if i had no species of merit  besides  it is still some  occupation to me to act my part in public  and bustle  noise  nonsense   if they do not amuse or interest me  yet they stifle reflection  may  you never know what it is to feel remorse  the idea of that poor wretch   lawless  whom i actually murdered as much as if i had shot him  haunts  me whenever i am alone  it is now between eight and nine years since he  died  and i have lived ever since in a constant course of dissipation   but it won t do  conscience  conscience will be heard  since my health  has been weakened  i believe i have acquired more conscience  i really  think that my stupid lord  who has neither ideas nor sensations  except  when he is intoxicated  is a hundred times happier than i am  but i will  spare you  belinda  i promised that you should not have a  scene   and i  will keep my word  it is  however  a great relief to open my mind to one  who has some feeling  harriot freke has none  i am convinced that she  has no more feeling than this table  i have not yet told you how she has  used me  you know that it was she who led or rather dragged me into that  scrape with lawless  for that i never reproached her  you know it was  she who frightened me into fighting that duel with mrs  luttridge   for this i never reproached her  she has cost me my peace of mind  my  health  my life  she knows it  and she forsakes  betrays  insults  and  leaves me to die  i cannot command my temper sufficiently to be coherent  when i speak of her  i cannot express in words what i feel  how could  that most treacherous of beings  for ten years  make me believe that she  was my friend  whilst i thought she really loved me  i pardoned her all  her faults   all   what a comprehensive word   all  all i forgave  and  continually said    but  she has a good heart   a good heart   she has  no heart   she has no feeling for any living creature but herself  i  always thought that she cared for no one but for me  but now i find  she can throw me off as easily as she would her glove  and this  too  i  suppose she calls a frolic  or  in her own vulgar language  fun  can you  believe it   what do you think she has done  my dear  she has gone over  at last to odious mrs  luttridge actually she has gone down with the  luttridges to    shire  the independent member having taken the chiltern  hundreds  vacates his seat  a new election comes on directly  the  luttridges are to bring in freke  not harriot s cousin  they have cut  him   but her husband  who is now to commence senator  he is to come  in for the county  upon condition that luttridge shall have freke s  borough  lord delacour  without saying one syllable  has promised his  interest to this precious junto  and lady delacour is left a miserable  cipher  my lord s motives i can clearly understand  he lost a thousand  guineas to mrs  luttridge this winter  and this is a convenient way of  paying her  why harriot should be so anxious to serve a husband whom  she hates  bitterly hates  might surprise any body who did not know   les dessous des cartes  as well as i do  you are but just come into the  world  belinda  the world of wickedness  i mean  my dear  or you would  have heard what a piece of work there was a few years ago about harriot  freke and this cousin of hers  without betraying her confidence  i may  just tell you what is known to every body  that she went so far  that if  it had not been for me  not a soul would have visited her  she swam in  the sea of folly out of her depth  the tide of fashion ebbed  and there  was she left sticking knee deep in the mud  a ridiculous  scandalous  figure  i had the courage and foolish good nature to hazard myself for  her  and actually dragged her to terra firma   how she has gone on  since i  cannot  tell you precisely  because i am in the secret  but the  catastrophe is public  to make her peace with her husband  she gives  up her friend  well  that i could have pardoned  if she had not been so  base as to go over to mrs  luttridge  mrs  luttridge offered  i ve seen  the letter  and harriot s answer  to bring in freke  the husband  and  to make both a county and a  family  peace  on condition that harriot  should give up all connexion with lady delacour  mrs  luttridge knew  this would provoke me beyond measure  and there is nothing she would not  do to gratify her mean  malevolent passions  she has succeeded for once  in her life  the blame of the duel  of course  is all thrown upon me   and  would you believe it   harriot freke  i am credibly informed   throws all the blame of lawless s business on me  nay  hints that  lawless s deathbed declaration of my innocence was  very generous   oh   the treachery  the baseness of this woman  and it was my fate to hear  all this last night at the masquerade  i waited  and waited  and looked  every where for harriot  she was to be the widow brady  i knew  at last  the widow brady made her appearance  and i accosted her with all my  usual familiarity  the widow was dumb  i insisted upon knowing the cause  of this sudden loss of speech  the widow took me into another  apartment  unmasked  and there i beheld mr  freke  the husband  i was  astonished  had no idea of the truth   where is harriot   i believe   were the first words i said   gone to the country    to the country     yes  to    shire  with mrs  luttridge    mrs  luttridge  odious mrs   luttridge  i could scarcely believe my senses  but freke  who always  hated me  believing that i led his wife  instead of her leading me into  mischief  would have enjoyed my astonishment and my rage  so i concealed  both  with all possible presence of mind  he went on over whelming me  with explanations and copies of letters  and declared it was at mrs   freke s request he did and said all this  and that he was to follow her  early the next morning to     shire  i broke from him  simply wishing  him a good journey  and as much family peace as his patience merited  he  knows that i know his wife s history  and though  she  has no shame  he  has some  i had the  satisfaction  to leave him blushing with anger  and  i supported the character of the comic muse a full hour afterwards   to convince him that all their combined malice would fail to break  my spirit in public  what i suffer in private is known only to my own  heart      as she finished these words  lady delacour rose abruptly  and hummed a  new opera air  then she retired to her boudoir  saying  with an air of  levity  to belinda as she left the room      good bye  my dear belinda  i leave you to ruminate sweet and bitter  thoughts  to think of the last speech and confession of lady delacour   or what will interest you much more  the first speech and confession  of  clarence hervey            chapter v     birthday dresses       lady delacour s history  and the manner in which it was related   excited in belinda s mind astonishment  pity  admiration  and contempt   astonishment at her inconsistency  pity for her misfortunes  admiration  of her talents  and contempt for her conduct  to these emotions  succeeded the recollection of the promise which she had made  not to  leave her in her last illness at the mercy of an insolent attendant   this promise belinda thought of with terror  she dreaded the sight of  sufferings which she knew must end in death  she dreaded the sight of  that affected gaiety and of that real levity which so ill became the  condition of a dying woman  she trembled at the idea of being under the  guidance of one who was so little able to conduct herself  and she could  not help blaming her aunt stanhope severely for placing her in such a  perilous situation  it was obvious that some of lady delacour s history  must have been known to mrs  stanhope  and belinda  the more she  reflected  was the more surprised at her aunt s having chosen such  a chaperon for a young woman just entering into the world  when the  understanding is suddenly roused and forced to exert itself  what a  multitude of deductions it makes in a short time  belinda saw things in  a new light  and for the first time in her life she reasoned for herself  upon what she saw and felt  it is sometimes safer for young people to  see than to hear of certain characters  at a distance  lady delacour had  appeared to miss portman the happiest person in the world  upon a nearer  view  she discovered that her ladyship was one of the most miserable of  human beings  to have married her niece to such a man as lord delacour   mrs  stanhope would have thought the most fortunate thing imaginable   but it was now obvious to belinda  that neither the title of  viscountess  nor the pleasure of spending three fortunes  could ensure  felicity  lady delacour confessed  that in the midst of the utmost  luxury and dissipation she had been a constant prey to ennui  that  the want of domestic happiness could never be supplied by that public  admiration of which she was so ambitious  and that the immoderate  indulgence of her vanity had led her  by inevitable steps  into follies  and imprudences which had ruined her health  and destroyed her peace of  mind   if lady delacour  with all the advantages of wealth  rank  wit   and beauty  has not been able to make herself happy in this life of  fashionable dissipation   said belinda to herself   why should i follow  the same course  and expect to be more fortunate      it is singular  that the very means which mrs  stanhope had taken to  make a fine lady of her niece tended to produce an effect diametrically  opposite to what might have been expected  the result of belinda s  reflections upon lady delacour s history was a resolution to benefit by  her bad example  but this resolution it was more easy to form than  to keep  her ladyship  where she wished to please or to govern  had  fascinating manners  and could alternately use the sarcastic powers of  wit  and the fond tone of persuasion  to accomplish her purposes  it was  belinda s intention  in pursuance of her new plans of life  to spend   whilst she remained in london  as little money as possible upon  superfluities and dress  she had  at her own disposal  only    l  per  annum  the interest of her fortune  but besides this  her aunt  who was  desirous that she should go to court  and make a splendid figure there   had sent her a draught on her banker for two hundred guineas   you will   i trust   said her aunt  at the conclusion of the letter   repay me when  you are established in the world  as i hope and believe  from what i  hear from lady delacour of the power of your charms  you will soon be   to the entire satisfaction of all your friends  pray do not neglect to  mention my friend clarence hervey particularly when you write next   i understand from one who is well acquainted with him  and who has  actually seen his rent roll  that he has a clear       l  a year      belinda resolved neither to go to court  nor to touch her aunt s two  hundred guineas  and she wrote a long letter to her  in which she  explained her feelings and views at large  in this letter she meant  to have returned mrs  stanhope s draught  but her feelings and views  changed between the writing of this epistle and the going out of the  post  mrs  franks  the milliner  came in the interim  and brought home  lady delacour s beautiful dress  it was not the sight of this  however   which changed belinda s mind  but she could not resist lady delacour s  raillery      why  my dear   said her ladyship  after having listened to all miss  portman could say about her love of independence  and the necessity  of economy to preserve that independence   all this is prodigiously  fine  but shall i translate it into plain english  you were mortally  wounded the other night by some random reflections of a set of foolish  young men  clarence hervey amongst the number  and instead of punishing  them  you sagely and generously determined to punish yourself  then  to  convince this youth that you have not a thought of those odious nets and  cages  that you have no design whatever upon his heart  and that he has  no manner of influence on yours  you very judiciously determine  at  the first hint from him  to change your dress  your manners  and your  character  and thus to say to him  in as plain terms as possible   you  see  sir  a word to the wise is enough  i understand you disapprove of  showy dress and coquetry  and therefore  as i dressed and coquetted only  to please you  now i shall lay aside dress and coquetry  since i  find that they are not to your taste  and i hope  sir  you like my  simplicity   depend upon it  my dear  clarence hervey understands  simplicity as well as you or i do  all this would be vastly well  if he  did not know that you overheard that conversation  but as he does know  it  trust me  he will attribute any sudden change in your manners and  appearance  right or wrong  to the motives i have mentioned  so don t   novice as you are  set about to manoeuvre for yourself  leave all that  to your aunt stanhope  or to me  and then you know your conscience will  be all the time as white as your hands   which  by the bye  clarence  hervey  the other day  said were the whitest hands he had ever seen   perhaps all this time you have taken it into your head that full dress  will not become you  but i assure you that it will  you look well in any  thing          but from the hoop s bewitching round      the very shoe has power to wound      so come down to mrs  franks  and order your birthnight dress like a  reasonable creature      like a reasonable creature  miss portman followed lady delacour  and  bespoke  or rather let her ladyship bespeak for her  fifty guineas   worth of elegance and fashion   you must go to the drawing room with me  next week  and be presented   said lady delacour   and then  as it is  the first time  you must be elegantly dressed  and you must not wear  the same dress on the birthnight  so  mrs  franks  let this be finished  first  as fast as you can  and by that time  perhaps  we shall think of  something superlatively charming for the night of nights      mrs  franks departed  and belinda sighed   a silver penny for your  thoughts   cried lady delacour   you are thinking that you are like  camilla  and i like mrs  mitten  novel reading   as i dare say you have  been told by your governess  as i was told by mine  and she by hers  i  suppose  novel reading for young ladies is the most dangerous         oh  clarence hervey  i protest   cried lady delacour  as he at this  instant entered the room   do  pray  clarence  help me out  for the sake  of this young lady  with a moral sentence against novel reading  but  that might go against your conscience  or your interest  so we ll spare  you  how i regret that we had not the charming serpent at the masquerade  the other night      the moment her ladyship mentioned the masquerade  the conversation  which had passed at lady singleton s came full into clarence hervey s  recollection  and his embarrassment was evident  not indeed to belinda   who had turned away to look over some new music that lay upon a stand  at the farthest end of the room  and she found this such a wonderfully  interesting occupation  that she did not for some minutes hear  or  appear to hear  one word of the conversation which was going on between  mr  hervey and lady delacour  at last  her ladyship tapped her upon  the shoulder  saying  in a playful tone   miss portman  i arrest your  attention at the suit of clarence hervey  this gentleman is passionately  fond of music  to my curse  for he never sees my harp but he worries  me with reproaches for having left off playing upon it  now he has just  given me his word that he will not reproach me again for a month to come  if you will favour us with one air  i assure you  clarence  that belinda  touches a harp divinely  she would absolutely charm       your ladyship  should not waste such valuable praise   interrupted belinda   do you  forget that belinda portman and her accomplishments have already been as  well advertised as packwood s razor strops      the manner in which these words were pronounced made a great impression  upon clarence hervey  and he began to believe it was possible that a  niece of the match making mrs  stanhope might not be  a compound of  art and affectation    though her aunt has advertised her   said he to  himself   she seems to have too much dignity to advertise herself  and  it would be very unjust to blame her for the faults of another person  i  will see more of her      some morning visitors were announced  who for the time suspended  clarence hervey s reflections  the effect of them  however  immediately  appeared  for as his good opinion of belinda increased  his ambition to  please her was strongly excited  he displayed all his powers of wit  and humour  and not only lady delacour but every body present observed    that mr  hervey  who was always the most entertaining man in the world   this morning surpassed himself  and was absolutely the most entertaining  man in the universe   he was mortified  notwithstanding  for he  distinctly perceived  that whilst belinda joined with ease and dignity  in the general conversation  her manner towards him was grave and  reserved  the next morning he called earlier than usual  but though lady  delacour was always at home to him  she was then unluckily dressing  to go to court  he inquired whether miss portman would accompany her  ladyship  and he learnt from his friend marriott that she was not to be  presented this day  because mrs  franks had not brought home her dress   mr  hervey called again two hours afterwards   lady delacour was gone  to court  he asked for miss portman   not at home   was the mortifying  answer  though  as he had passed by the windows  he had heard the  delightful sound of her harp  he walked up and down in the square  impatiently  till he saw lady delacour s carriage appear      the drawing room has lasted an unconscionable time this morning    said he  as he handed her ladyship out of her coach   am not i the most  virtuous of virtuous women   said lady delacour   to go to court such a  day as this  but   whispered she  as she went up stairs   like all other  amazingly good people  i have amazingly good reasons for being good  the  queen is soon to give a charming breakfast at frogmore  and i am paying  my court with all my might  in hopes of being asked  for belinda must  see one of their galas before we leave town   that  i m determined  upon   but where is she    not at home   said clarence  smiling   oh   not at home is nonsense  you know  shine out  appear  be found  my  lovely zara   cried lady delacour  opening the library door   here she  is  what doing i know not  studying hervey s meditations on the tombs  i  should guess  by the sanctification of her looks  if you be not totally  above all sublunary considerations  admire my lilies of the valley  and  let me give you a lecture  not upon heads  or upon hearts  but on what  is of much more consequence  upon hoops  every body wears hoops  but  how few   tis a melancholy consideration  how very few can manage them   there s my friend lady c      in an elegant undress she passes for very  genteel  but put her into a hoop and she looks as pitiable a figure  as  much a prisoner  and as little able to walk  as a child in a go cart   she gets on  i grant you  and so does the poor child  but  getting on   you know  is not walking  oh  clarence  i wish you had seen the two  lady r  s sticking close to one another  their father pushing them on  together  like two decanters in a bottle coaster  with such magnificent  diamond labels round their necks      encouraged by clarence hervey s laughter  lady delacour went on to mimic  what she called the hoop awkwardness of all her acquaintance  and if  these could have failed to divert belinda  it was impossible for her to  be serious when she heard clarence hervey declare that he was convinced  he could manage a hoop as well as any woman in england  except lady  delacour      now here   said he   is the purblind dowager  lady boucher  just at the  door  lady delacour  she would not know my face  she would not see my  beard  and i will bet fifty guineas that i come into a room in a hoop   and that she does not find me out by my air  that i do not betray  myself  in short  by my masculine awkwardness       i hold you to your word  clarence   cried lady delacour   they have let  the purblind dowager in  i hear her on the stairs  here  through this  way you can go  as you do every thing quicker than any body else in the  world  you will certainly be full dressed in a quarter of an hour  i ll  engage to keep the dowager in scandal for that time  go  marriott has  old hoops and old finery of mine  and you have all powerful influence   i know  with marriott  so go and use it  and let us see you in all your  glory  though i vow i tremble for my fifty guineas      lady delacour kept the dowager in scandal  according to her engagement   for a good quarter of an hour  then the dresses at the drawing room took  up another quarter  and  at last  the dowager began to give an account  of sundry wonderful cures that had been performed  to her certain  knowledge  by her favourite concentrated extract or anima of quassia   she entered into the history of the negro slave named quassi  who  discovered this medical wood  which he kept a close secret till mr   daghlberg  a magistrate of surinam  wormed it out of him  brought  a branch of the tree to europe  and communicated it to the great  linnaeus  when clarence hervey was announced by the title of  the  countess de pomenars       an emigree  a charming woman   whispered lady delacour  she was to have  been at the drawing room to day but for a blunder of mine  ready dressed  she was  and i didn t call for her  ah  mad  de pomenars  i am actually  ashamed to see you   continued her ladyship  and she went forward to  meet clarence hervey  who really made his entree with very composed  assurance and grace  he managed his hoop with such skill and dexterity   that he well deserved the praise of being a universal genius  the  countess de pomenars spoke french and broken english incomparably well   and she made out that she was descended from the pomenars of the time  of mad  de sevigne  she said that she had in her possession several  original letters of mad  de sevigne  and a lock of mad  de grignan s  fine hair      i have sometimes fancied  but i believe it is only my fancy   said lady  delacour   that this young lady   turning to belinda   is not unlike  your mad  de grignan  i have seen a picture of her at strawberry hill      mad  de pomenars acknowledged that there was a resemblance  but added   that it was flattery in the extreme to mad  de grignan to say so      it would be a sin  undoubtedly  to waste flattery upon the dead  my  dear countess   said lady delacour   but here  without flattery to the  living  as you have a lock of mad  de grignan s hair  you can tell us  whether  la belle chevelure   of which mad  de sevigne talked so much   was any thing to be compared to my belinda s   as she spoke  lady  delacour  before belinda was aware of her intentions  dexterously let  down her beautiful tresses  and the countess de pomenars was so much  struck at the sight  that she was incapable of paying the necessary  compliments   nay  touch it   said lady delacour   it is so fine and so  soft      at this dangerous moment her ladyship artfully let drop the comb   clarence hervey suddenly stooped to pick it up  totally forgetting his  hoop and his character  he threw down the music stand with his hoop   lady delacour exclaimed  bravissima   and burst out a laughing  lady  boucher  in amazement  looked from one to another for an explanation   and was a considerable time before  as she said  she could believe her  own eyes  clarence hervey acknowledged he had lost his bet  joined in  the laugh  and declared that fifty guineas was too little to pay for the  sight of the finest hair that he had ever beheld   i declare he deserves  a lock of  la belle chevelure  for that speech  miss portman   cried  lady delacour   i ll appeal to all the world  mad  de pomenars must have  a lock to measure with mad  de grignan s  come  a second rape of the  lock  belinda      fortunately for belinda   the glittering forfex  was not immediately  produced  as fine ladies do not now  as in former times  carry any such  useless implements about with them     such was the modest  graceful dignity of miss portman s manners  that  she escaped without even the charge of prudery  she retired to her own  apartment as soon as she could      she passes on in unblenched majesty   said lady delacour      she is really a charming woman   said clarence hervey  in a low voice   to lady delacour  drawing her into a recessed window  he in the same  low voice continued   could i obtain a private audience of a few minutes  when your ladyship is at leisure   i have     i am never at leisure    interrupted lady delacour   but if you have any thing particular to say  to me  as i guess you have  by my skill in human nature  come here to my  concert to night  before the rest of the world  wait patiently in the  music room  and perhaps i may grant you a private audience  as you had  the grace not to call it a  tete a tete   in the mean time  my dear  countess de pomenars  had we not better take off our hoops   in the  evening  clarence hervey was in the music room a considerable time  before lady delacour appeared  how patiently he waited is not known to  any one but himself      have not i given you time to compose a charming speech   said lady  delacour as she entered the room   but make it as short as you can   unless you wish that miss portman should hear it  for she will be down  stairs in three minutes       in one word  then  my dear lady delacour  can you  and will you  make  my peace with miss portman   i am much concerned about that foolish  razor strop dialogue which she overheard at lady singleton s       you are concerned that she overheard it  no doubt       no   said clarence hervey   i am rejoiced that she overheard it  since  it has been the means of convincing me of my mistake  but i am concerned  that i had the presumption and injustice to judge of miss portman so  hastily  i am convinced that  though she is a niece of mrs  stanhope s   she has dignity of mind and simplicity of character  will you  my dear  lady delacour  tell her so       stay   interrupted lady delacour   let me get it by heart  i should  have made a terrible bad messenger of the gods and goddesses  for i  never in my life could  like iris  repeat a message in the same words  in which it was delivered to me  let me see   dignity of mind and  simplicity of character   was not it  may not i say at once   my dear  belinda  clarence hervey desires me to tell you that he is convinced  you are an angel   that single word  angel  is so expressive  so  comprehensive  so comprehensible  it contains  believe me  all that can  be said or imagined on these occasions   de part et d autre        but   said mr  hervey   perhaps miss portman has heard the song of           what know we of angels       i spake it in jest        then you are not in jest  but in downright sober earnest   ha   said  lady delacour  with an arch look   i did not know it was already come to   this  with you      and her ladyship  turning to her piano forte  played           there was a young man in ballinacrasy       who wanted a wife to make him un asy        and thus in gentle strains he spoke her       arrah  will you marry me  my dear ally croker       no  no   exclaimed clarence  laughing   it is not come to  that  with  me yet  lady delacour  i promise you  but is not it possible to say that  a young lady has dignity of mind and simplicity of character without  having or suggesting any thoughts of marriage       you make a most proper  but not sufficiently emphatic difference  between having or suggesting such thoughts   said lady delacour   a  gentleman sometimes finds it for his interest  his honour  or his  pleasure  to suggest what he would not for the world promise   i mean  perform       a scoundrel   cried clarence hervey   not a gentleman  may find it for  his honour  or his interest  or his pleasure  to promise what he would  not perform  but i am not a scoundrel  i never made any promise to man  or woman that i did not keep faithfully  i am not a swindler in love       and yet   said lady delacour   you would have no scruple to trifle or  flatter a woman out of her heart        cela est selon    said clarence smiling   a fair exchange  you know   is no robbery  when a fine woman robs me of my heart  surely lady  delacour could not expect that i should make no attempt upon hers     is  this part of my message to miss portman   said lady delacour   as your  ladyship pleases   said clarence   i trust entirely to your discretion       why i really have a great deal of discretion   said lady delacour   but  you trust too much to it when you expect that i should execute  both  with propriety and success  the delicate commission of telling a young  lady  who is under my protection  that a young gentleman  who is a  professed admirer of mine  is in love with her  but has no thoughts  and  wishes to suggest no thoughts  of marriage       in love   exclaimed clarence hervey   but when did i ever use the  expression  in speaking of miss portman  i simply expressed esteem and  ad              no additions   said lady delacour   content yourself with  esteem  simply   and miss portman is safe  and you too  i presume   apropos  pray  clarence  how do your esteem and  admiration   i may go  as far as that  may not i   of miss portman agree with your admiration  of lady delacour       perfectly well   replied clarence   for all the world must be sensible  that clarence hervey is a man of too much taste to compare a country  novice in wit and accomplishments to lady delacour  he might  as men  of genius sometimes do  look forward to the idea of forming a country  novice for a wife  a man must marry some time or other  but my hour   thank heaven  is not come yet       thank heaven   said lady delacour   for you know a married man is lost  to the world of fashion and gallantry       not more so  i should hope  than a married woman   said clarence  harvey  here a loud knocking at the door announced the arrival of  company to the concert   you will make my peace  you promise me  with  miss portman   cried clarence eagerly      yes  i will make your peace  and you shall see belinda smile upon  you once more  upon condition   continued lady delacour  speaking  very quickly  as if she was hurried by the sound of people coming up  stairs   but we ll talk of that another time       nay  nay  my dear lady delacour  now  now   said clarence  seizing her  hand    upon condition  upon what condition       upon condition that you do a little job for me  indeed for belinda  she  is to go with me to the birth night  and she has often hinted to me that  our horses are shockingly shabby for people of our condition  i know she  wishes that upon such an occasion  her first appearance at court  you  know  we should go in style  now my dear positive lord has  said  he  will not let us have a pair of the handsomest horses i ever saw  which  are at tattersal s  and on which belinda  i know  has secretly set her  heart  as i have openly  in vain       your ladyship and miss portman cannot possibly set your hearts on  any thing in vain  especially on any thing that it is in the power of  clarence hervey to procure  then   added he  gallantly kissing her hand    may i thus seal my treaty of peace       what audacity   don t you see these people coming in   cried lady  delacour  and she withdrew her hand  but with no great precipitation   she was evidently   at this moment  as in all the past   neither afraid  nor ashamed that mr  hervey s devotions to her should be paid in public   with much address she had satisfied herself as to his views with respect  to belinda  she was convinced that he had no immediate thoughts of  matrimony  but that if he were condemned to marry  miss portman would  be his wife  as this did not interfere with her plans  lady delacour was  content           chapter vi     ways and means       when lady delacour repeated to miss portman the message about   simplicity of mind and dignity of character   she frankly said       belinda  notwithstanding all this  observe  i m determined to retain  clarence hervey among the number of my public worshippers during my  life  which you know cannot last long  after i am gone  my dear  he ll  be all your own  and of that i give you joy  posthumous fame is a silly  thing  but posthumous jealousy detestable      there was one part of the conversation between mr  hervey and her  ladyship which she  in her great discretion  did not immediately  repeat to miss portman  that part which related to the horses  in this  transaction belinda had no farther share than having once  when her  ladyship had the handsome horses brought for her to look at  assented  to the opinion that they were the handsomest horses she ever beheld  mr   hervey  however gallantly he replied to her ladyship  was secretly vexed  to find that belinda had so little delicacy as to permit her name to  be employed in such a manner  he repented having used the improper  expression of  dignity of mind   and he relapsed into his former opinion  of mrs  stanhope s niece  a relapse is always more dangerous than the  first disease  he sent home the horses to lady delacour the next  day  and addressed belinda  when he met her  with the air of a man of  gallantry  who thought that his peace had been cheaply made  but in  proportion as his manners became more familiar  hers grew more reserved   lady delacour rallied her upon  her prudery   but in vain  clarence  hervey seemed to think that her ladyship had not fulfilled her part of  the bargain    is not  smiling    said he   the epithet always applied  to peace  yet i have not been able to obtain one smile from miss  portman since i have been promised peace   embarrassed by mr  hervey s  reproaches  and provoked to find that belinda was proof against all her  raillery  lady delacour grew quite ill humoured towards her  belinda   unconscious of having given any just cause of offence  was unmoved  and  her ladyship s embarrassment increased  at last  resuming all her former  appearance of friendship and confidence  she suddenly exclaimed one  night after she had flattered belinda into high spirits       do you know  my dear  that i have been so ashamed of myself  for this week past  that i have hardly dared to look you in the face   i am sensible i was downright rude and cross to you one day  and ever  since i have been penitent  and  as all penitents are  very stupid and  disagreeable  i am sure  but tell me you forgive my caprice  and lady  delacour will be herself again      it was not difficult to obtain belinda s forgiveness      indeed   continued lady delacour   you are too good  but then in my  own justification i must say  that i have more things to make me  ill humoured than most people have  now  my dear  that most obstinate  of human beings  lord delacour  has reduced me to the most terrible  situation  i have made clarence hervey buy a pair of horses for me  and  i cannot make my lord delacour pay for them  but i forgot to tell you  that i took your name  not in vain indeed  in this business  i told  clarence  that upon condition he would do this  job  for me  you would  forgive him for all his sins  and  nay  my dear  why do you look as if  i had stabbed you to the heart   after all  i only drew upon your  pretty mouth for a few smiles  pray let me see whether it has actually  forgotten  how  to smile      belinda was too much vexed at this instant to understand raillery  she  was inspired by anger with unwonted courage  and  losing all fear of  lady delacour s wit  she very seriously expostulated with her ladyship  upon having thus used her name without her consent or knowledge  belinda  felt she was now in danger of being led into a situation which might  be fatal to her reputation and her happiness  and she was the more  surprised at her ladyship  when she recollected the history she had so  lately heard of harriot freke and colonel lawless      you cannot but be sensible  lady delacour   said belinda   that after  the contempt i have heard mr  hervey express for match making with mrs   stanhope s nieces  i should degrade myself by any attempts to attract  his attention  no wit  no eloquence  can change my opinion upon this  subject  i cannot endure contempt       very likely  no doubt   interrupted lady delacour   but if you would  only open your eyes  which heroines make it a principle never to do  or  else there would be an end of the novel  if you would only open your  eyes  you would see that this man is in love with you  and whilst you  are afraid of his contempt  he is a hundred times more afraid of yours   and as long as you are each of you in such fear of you know not  what  you must excuse me if i indulge myself in a little wholesome  raillery    belinda smiled    there now  one such smile as that for  clarence hervey  and i m out of debt and danger   said lady delacour      o lady delacour  why  why will you try your power over me in this  manner   said belinda   you know that i ought not to be persuaded to do  what i am conscious is wrong  but a few days ago you told me yourself  that mr  hervey is  is not a marrying man  and a woman of your  penetration must see that  that he only means to flirt with me  i am  not a match for mr  hervey in any respect  he is a man of wit and  gallantry  i am unpractised in the ways of the world  i was not educated  by my aunt stanhope  i have only been with her a few years  i wish i had  never been with her in my life       i ll take care mr  hervey shall know that   said lady delacour   but in  the mean time i do think any fair appraiser of delicate distresses would  decide that i am  all the circumstances considered  more to be pitied  at this present moment than you are  for the catastrophe of the business  evidently is  that i must pay two hundred guineas for the horses somehow  or other       i can pay for them   exclaimed belinda   and will with the greatest  pleasure  i will not go to the birthnight  my dress is not bespoke   will two hundred guineas pay for the horses  oh  take the money  pay mr   hervey  dear lady delacour  and it will all be right       you are a charming girl   said lady delacour  embracing her   but how  can i answer for it to my conscience  or to your aunt stanhope  if you  don t appear on the birthnight  that cannot be  my dear  besides  you  know mrs  franks will send home your drawing room dress to day  and  it would be so foolish to be presented for nothing  not to go to the  birthnight afterwards  if you say  a  you must say  b        then   said belinda   i will not go to the drawing room     not go  my  dear  what  throw away fifty guineas for nothing  really i never saw any  one so lavish of her money  and so economic of her smiles       surely   said miss portman   it is better for me to throw away fifty  guineas  poor as i am  than to hazard the happiness of my life  your  ladyship knows that if i say  a  to mr  hervey  i must say  b   no  no   my dear lady delacour  here is the draught for two hundred guineas  pay  mr  hervey  for heaven s sake  and there is an end of the business       what a positive child it is  well  then  it shall not be forced to say  the a  b  c  of cupid s alphabet  to that terrible pedagogue  clarence  hervey  till it pleases  but seriously  miss portman  i am concerned  that you will make me take this draught  it is absolutely robbing you   but lord delacour s the person you must blame  it is all his obstinacy   having once said he would not pay for the horses  he would see them  and me and the whole human race expire before he would change his silly  mind   next month i shall have it in my power  my dear  to repay you  with a thousand thanks  and in a few months more we shall have another  birthday  and a new star shall appear in the firmament of fashion   and it shall be called belinda  in the mean time  my dear  upon second  thoughts  perhaps we can get mrs  franks to dispose of your drawing room  dress to some person of taste  and you may keep your fifty guineas for  the next occasion  i ll see what can be done   adieu  a thousand thanks   silly child as you are      mrs  franks at first declared that it would be an impossibility to  dispose of miss portman s dress  though she would do any thing upon  earth to oblige lady delacour  however  ten guineas made every thing  possible  belinda rejoiced at having  as she thought  extricated herself  at so cheap a rate  and well pleased with her own conduct  she wrote to  her aunt stanhope  to inform her of as much of the transaction as she  could disclose  without betraying lady delacour   her ladyship    she said   had immediate occasion for two hundred guineas  and to  accommodate her with this sum she had given up the idea of going to  court      the tenor of miss portman s letter will be sufficiently apparent from  mrs  stanhope s answer     mrs  stanhope to miss portman      bath  june  nd      i cannot but feel some astonishment  belinda  at your very  extraordinary conduct  and more extraordinary letter  what you can mean  by principles and delicacy i own i don t pretend to understand  when  i see you not only forget the respect that is due to the opinions  and advice of the aunt to whom you owe every thing  but you take upon  yourself to lavish her money  without common honesty  i send you two  hundred guineas  and desire you to go to court  you lend my two hundred  guineas to lady delacour  and inform me that as you think yourself bound  in honour to her ladyship  you cannot explain all the particulars to  me  otherwise you are sure i should approve of the reasons which have  influenced you  mighty satisfactory  truly  and then  to mend the  matter  you tell me that you do not think that in your situation in life  it is necessary that you should go to court  your opinions and mine  you  add  differ in many points  then i must say that you are as ungrateful  as you are presumptuous  for i am not such a novice in the affairs of  the world as to be ignorant that when a young lady professes to be of  a different opinion from her friends  it is only a prelude to something  worse  she begins by saying that she is determined to think for herself   and she is determined to act for herself  and then it is all over with  her  and all the money   c  that has been spent upon her education is so  much dead loss to her friends      now i look upon it that a young girl who has been brought up  and  brought forward in the world as you have been by connexions  is bound to  be guided implicitly by them in all her conduct  what should you think  of a man who  after he had been brought into parliament by a friend   would go and vote against that friend s opinions  you do not want sense   belinda  you perfectly understand me  and consequently your errors i  must impute to the defect of your heart  and not of your judgment  i see  that  on account of the illness of the princess  the king s birthday is  put off for a fortnight  if you manage properly  and if  unknown to lady        who certainly has not used you well in this business  and to whom  therefore you owe no peculiar delicacy  you make lord      sensible how  much your aunt stanhope is disappointed and displeased  as i most truly  am  at your intention of missing this opportunity of appearing at court   it is ten to one but his lordship  who has not made it a point to refuse  your request  i suppose  will pay you your two hundred guineas  you of  course will make proper acknowledgments  but at the same time entreat  that his lordship will not  commit  you with his lady  as she might  be offended at your application to him  i understand from an intimate  acquaintance of his  that you are a great favourite of his lordship  and  though an obstinate  he is a good natured man  and can have no fear of  being governed by you  consequently he will do just as you would have  him      then you have an opportunity of representing the thing in the  prettiest manner imaginable to lady       as an instance of her lord s  consideration for her  so you will oblige all parties  a very desirable  thing  without costing yourself one penny  and go to the birthnight  after all  and this only by using a little address  without which  nothing is to be done in this world      yours affectionately  if you follow my advice       selina stanhope      belinda  though she could not  consistently with what she thought right   follow the advice so artfully given to her in this epistle  was yet  extremely concerned to find that she had incurred the displeasure of an  aunt to whom she thought herself under obligations  she resolved to lay  by as much as she possibly could  from the interest of her fortune  and  to repay the two hundred guineas to mrs  stanhope  she was conscious  that she had no right to lend this money to lady delacour  if her aunt  had expressly desired that she should spend it only on her court dress   but this had not distinctly been expressed when mrs  stanhope sent her  niece the draft  that lady was in the habit of speaking and writing  ambiguously  so that even those who knew her best were frequently in  doubt how to interpret her words  yet she was extremely displeased when  her hints and her half expressed wishes were not understood  beside  the concern she felt from the thoughts of having displeased her aunt   belinda was both vexed and mortified to perceive that in clarence  hervey s manner towards her there was not the change which she had  expected that her conduct would naturally produce     one day she was surprised at his reproaching her for caprice in having  given up her intentions of going to court  lady delacour s embarrassment  whilst mr  hervey spoke  belinda attributed to her ladyship s desire  that clarence should not know that she had been obliged to borrow the  money to pay him for the horses  belinda thought that this was a  species of mean pride  but she made it a point to keep her ladyship s  secret  she therefore slightly answered mr  hervey   that she wondered  that a man who was so well acquainted with the female sex should be  surprised at any instance of caprice from a woman   the conversation  then took another turn  and whilst they were talking of indifferent  subjects  in came lord delacour s man  champfort  with mrs  stanhope s  draft for two hundred guineas  which the coachmaker s man had just  brought back because miss portman had forgotten to endorse it  belinda s  astonishment was almost as great at this instant as lady delacour s  confusion      come this way  my dear  and we ll find you a pen and ink  you need not  wait  champfort  but tell the man to wait for the draft  miss portman  will endorse it immediately    and she took belinda into another room      good heavens  has not this money been paid to mr  hervey   exclaimed  belinda      no  my dear  but i will take all the blame upon myself  or  which  will do just as well for you  throw it all upon my better half  my lord  delacour would not pay for my new carriage  the coachmaker  insolent  animal  would not let it out of his yard without two hundred guineas in  ready money  now you know i had the horses  and what could i do with the  horses without the carriage  clarence hervey  i knew  could wait for  his money better than a poor devil of a coachmaker  so i paid the  coachmaker  and a few months sooner or later can make no difference to  clarence  who rolls in gold  my dear  if that will be any comfort to  you  as i hope it will       oh  what will he think of me   said belinda      nay  what will he think of  me   child       lady delacour   said belinda  in a firmer tone than she had ever before  spoken   i must insist upon this draft being given to mr  hervey       absolutely impossible  my dear   i cannot take it from the coachmaker   he has sent home the carriage  the thing s done  and cannot be undone   but come  since i know nothing else will make you easy  i will take  this mighty favour from mr  hervey entirely upon my own conscience  you  cannot object to that  for you are not the keeper of my conscience  i  will tell clarence the whole business  and do you honour due  my dear   so endorse the check  whilst i go and sound both the praises of your  dignity of mind  and simplicity of character   c   c   c   c      her ladyship broke away from belinda  returned to clarence hervey  and  told the whole affair with that peculiar grace with which she knew how  to make a good story of a bad one  clarence was as favourable an auditor  at this time as she could possibly have found  for no human being could  value money less than he did  and all sense of her ladyship s meanness  was lost in his joy at discovering that belinda was worthy of his  esteem  now he felt in its fullest extent all the power she had over  his heart  and he was upon the point of declaring his attachment to her   when  malheureusement  sir philip baddely and mr  rochfort announced  themselves by the noise they made on the staircase  these were the young  men who had spoken in such a contemptuous manner at lady singleton s of  the match making mrs  stanhope and her nieces  mr  hervey was anxious  that they should not penetrate into the state of his heart  and he  concealed his emotion by instantly assuming that kind of rattling gaiety  which always delighted his companions  who were ever in want of some  one to set their stagnant ideas in motion  at last they insisted upon  carrying clarence away with them to taste some wines for sir philip  baddely           chapter vii     the serpentine river       in his way to st  james s street  where the wine merchant lived  sir  philip baddely picked up several young men of his acquaintance  who were  all eager to witness a trial of  taste   of epicurean taste  between the  baronet and clarence hervey  amongst his other accomplishments our hero  piqued himself upon the exquisite accuracy of his organs of taste  he  neither loved wine  nor was he fond of eating  but at fine dinners   with young men who were real epicures  hervey gave himself the airs of  a connoisseur  and asserted superiority even in judging of wine and  sauces  having gained immortal honour at an entertainment by gravely  protesting that some turtle would have been excellent if it had not  been done  a bubble too much   he presumed  elate as he was with the  applauses of the company  to assert  that no man in england had a more  correct taste than himself   sir philip baddely could not passively  submit to this arrogance  he loudly proclaimed  that though he would  not dispute mr  hervey s judgment as far as eating was concerned  yet he  would defy him as a connoisseur in wines  and he offered to submit the  competition to any eminent wine merchant in london  and to some common  friend of acknowledged taste and experience   mr  rochfort was chosen  as the common friend of acknowledged taste and experience  and a  fashionable wine merchant was pitched upon to decide with him the merits  of these candidates for bacchanalian fame  sir philip  who was just  going to furnish his cellars  was a person of importance to the  wine merchant  who produced accordingly his choicest treasures  sir  philip and clarence tasted of all in their turns  sir philip with real   and clarence with affected gravity  and they delivered their opinions  of the positive and comparative merits of each  the wine merchant  evidently  as mr  hervey thought  leaned towards sir philip   upon  my word  sir philip  you are right  that wine is the best i have  you  certainly have a most discriminating taste   said the complaisant  wine merchant      i ll tell you what   cried sir philip   the thing is this  by jove   now  there s no possibility now  no possibility now  by jove  of  imposing upon me       then   said clarence hervey   would you engage to tell the differences  between these two wines ten times running  blind fold       ten times  that s nothing   replied sir philip   yes  fifty times  i  would  by jove      but when it came to the trial  sir philip had nothing left but oaths  in his own favour  clarence hervey was victorious  and his sense of the  importance of this victory was much increased by the fumes of the wine   which began to operate upon his brain  his triumph was  as he said it  ought to be  bacchanalian  he laughed and sang with anacreontic  spirit  and finished by declaring that he deserved to be crowned with  vine leaves      dine with me  clarence   said rochfort   and we ll crown you with three  times three  and   whispered he to sir philip   we ll have another trial  after dinner       but as it s not near dinner time yet  what shall we do with ourselves  till dinner time   said sir philip  yawning pathetically     clarence not being used to drink in a morning  though all his companions  were  was much affected by the wine  and rochfort proposed that they  should take a turn in the park to cool hervey s head  to hyde park they  repaired  sir philip boasting  all the way they walked  of the superior  strength of his head     clarence protested that his own was stronger than any man s in england   and observed  that at this instant he walked better than any person in  company  sir philip baddely not excepted  now sir philip baddely was a  noted pedestrian  and he immediately challenged our hero to walk  with him for any money he pleased   done   said clarence   for ten  guineas  for any money you please   and instantly they set out to  walk  as rochfort cried  one  two  three  and away  keep the path  and  whichever reaches that elm tree first has it      they were exactly even for some yards  then clarence got ahead of sir  philip  and he reached the elm tree first  but as he waved his hat   exclaiming   clarence has won the day   sir philip came up with his  companions  and coolly informed him that he had lost his wager   lost   lost  lost  clarence  fairly lost       didn t i reach the tree first   said clarence      yes   answered his companions   but you didn t keep the path  you  turned out of the way when you met that crowd of children yonder       now  i    said sir philip   dashed fairly through them  kept the path   and won my bet       but   said hervey   would you have had me run over that little child   who was stooping down just in my way        i    not i   said sir philip   but i would have you go through with  your civility  if a man will be polite  he must pay for his politeness  sometimes   you said you d lay me  any money  i pleased  recollect  now  i m very moderate  and as you are a particular friend  clarence  i ll  only take your ten guineas      a loud laugh from his companions provoked clarence  they were glad  to  have a laugh against him   because he excited universal envy by the real  superiority of his talents  and by his perpetually taking the lead in  those trifles which were beneath his ambition  and exactly suited to  engage the attention of his associates      be it so  and welcome  i ll pay ten guineas for having better manners  than any of you   cried hervey  laughing   but remember  though i ve lost  this bet  i don t give up my pedestrian fame   sir philip  there are no  women to throw golden apples in my way now  and no children for me to  stumble over  i dare you to another trial  double or quit       i m off  by jove   said sir philip   i m too hot  damme  to walk with  you any more  but i m your man if you ve a mind for a swim  here s the  serpentine river  clarence  hey  damn it   hey      sir philip and all his companions knew that clarence had never learned  to swim      you may wink at one another  as wisely as you please   said clarence    but come on  my boys  i am your man for a swim  hundred guineas upon  it              darest thou  rochfort  now      leap in with me into this weedy flood       and swim to yonder point       and instantly hervey  who had in his confused head some recollection of  an essay of dr  franklin on swimming  by which he fancied that he could  ensure at once his safety and his fame  threw off his coat and jumped  into the river  luckily he was not in boots  rochfort  and all the other  young men stood laughing by the river side      who the devil are these two that seem to be making up to us   said  sir philip  looking at two gentlemen who were coming towards them   st   george  hey  you know every body       the foremost is percival  of oakly park  i think   pon my honour    replied mr  st  george  and he then began to settle how many thousands  a year mr  percival was worth  this point was not decided when the  gentlemen came up to the spot where sir philip was standing     the child for whose sake clarence hervey had lost his bet was mr   percival s  and he came to thank him for his civility   the gentleman  who accompanied mr  percival was an old friend of clarence hervey s  he  had met him abroad  but had not seen him for some years      pray  gentlemen   said he to sir philip and his party   is mr  clarence  hervey amongst you  i think i saw him pass by me just now       damn it  yes  where is clary  though   exclaimed sir philip  suddenly  recollecting himself   clarence hervey at this instant was drowning  he  had got out of his depth  and had struggled in vain to recover himself      curse me  if it s not all over with clary   continued sir philip   do  any of you see his head any where  damn you  rochfort  yonder it is       damme  so it is   said rochfort   but he s so heavy in his clothes   he d pull me down along with him to davy s locker   damme  if i ll go  after him       damn it  though  can t some of ye swim  can t some of ye jump in    cried sir philip  turning to his companions   damn it  clarence will go  to the bottom      and so he inevitably would have done  had not mr  percival at this  instant leaped into the river  and seized hold of the drowning clarence   it was with great difficulty that he dragged him to the shore   sir  philip s party  as soon as the danger was over  officiously offered  their assistance  clarence hervey was absolutely senseless   damn it   what shall we do with him now   said sir philip   damn it  we must call  some of the people from the boat house  he s as heavy as lead  damn me   if i know what to do with him          whilst sir philip was damning himself  mr  percival ran to the  boat house for assistance  and they carried the body into the house   the elderly gentleman who had accompanied mr  percival now made his way  through the midst of the noisy crowd  and directed what should be done  to restore mr  hervey s suspended animation  whilst he was employed in  this benevolent manner  clarence s worthy friends were sneering at him   and whispering to one another   ecod  he talks as if he was a doctor    said rochfort       pon honour  i do believe   said st  george   he is the famous dr   x      i met him at a circulating library t other day       dr  x     the writer  do you mean   said sir philip   then  damn me   we d better get out of his way as fast as we can  or he ll have some  of us down in black and white  and curse me  if i should choose to meet  with myself in a book       no danger of that   said rochfort   for how can one meet with oneself  in a book  sir philip  if one never opens one   by jove  that s the true  way       but   pon my honour   said st  george   i should like of all things to  see myself in print   twould make one famously famous       damn me  if i don t flatter myself  though  one can make oneself famous  enough to all intents and purposes without having any thing to say to  these author geniuses  you re a famous fellow  faith  to want to see  yourself in print  i ll publish this in bond street  damn it  in point  of famousness  i d sport my random against all the books that ever were  read or written  damn me  but what are we doing here       hervey s in good hands   said rochfort   and this here s a cursed  stupid lounge for us  besides  it s getting towards dinner time  so  my voice is  let s be off  and we can leave st  george  who has such a  famous mind to be in the doctor s book  to bring clary after us  when  he s ready for dinner and good company again  you know  ha  ha  ha      away the faithful friends went to the important business of their day     when clarence hervey came to his senses he started up  rubbed his eyes   and looked about  exclaiming   what s all this   where am i   where s  baddely   where s rochfort   where are they all       gone home to dinner   answered mr  st  george  who was a hanger on of  sir philip s   but they left me to bring you after them  faith  clary   you ve had a squeak for your life   pon my honour  we thought at one  time it was all over with you  but you re a rough one  we shan t have to   pour over your grave a full bottle of red  as yet  my boy  you ll do as  well as ever  so i ll step and call a coach for you  clary  and we shall  be at dinner as soon as the best of  em after all  by jingo  i leave you  in good hands with the doctor here  that brought you to life  and the  gentleman that dragged you out of the water  here s a note for you    whispered mr  st  george  as he leaned over clarence hervey   here s  a note for you from sir philip and rochfort  read it  do you mind  to   yourself        if i can   said clarence   but sir philip writes a  bloody bad hand             oh  he s a  baronet    said st  george   ha  ha  ha   and  charmed with  his own wit  he left the boat house     clarence with some difficulty deciphered the note  which contained these  words      quiz the doctor  clary  as soon as you are up to it  he s an author  so  fair game  quiz the doctor  and we ll drink your health with three times  three in rochfort s burgundy      yours   c      phil  baddely      p s  burn this when read      with the request contained in the postscript clarence immediately  complied  he threw the note into the fire with indignation the moment  that he had read it  and turning towards the gentleman to whom it  alluded  he began to express  in the strongest terms  his gratitude  for their benevolence  but he stopped short in the midst of his  acknowledgments  when he discovered to whom he was speaking      dr  x       cried he   is it possible  how rejoiced i am to see you   and how rejoiced i am to be obliged to you  there is not a man in  england to whom i would rather be obliged       you are not acquainted with mr  percival  i believe   said dr  x        give me leave  mr  percival  to introduce to you the young gentleman  whose life you have saved  and whose life  though  by the company in  which you found him  you might not think so  is worth saving  this  sir   is no less a man than mr  clarence hervey  of whose universal genius you  have just had a specimen  for which he was crowned with sedges  as he  well deserved  by the god of the serpentine river  do not be so unjust  as to imagine that he has any of the presumption which is sometimes the  chief characteristic of a man of universal genius  mr  clarence hervey  is  without exception  the most humble man of my acquaintance  for  whilst all good judges would think him fit company for mr  percival  he  has the humility to think himself upon a level with mr  rochfort and sir  philip baddely       you have lost as little of your satirical wit  dr  x      as of your  active benevolence  i perceive   said clarence hervey   since i met you  abroad  but as i cannot submit to your unjust charge of humility  will  you tell me where you are to be found in town  and to morrow            to morrow  and to morrow  and to morrow   said dr  x       why not  to day       i am engaged   said clarence  hesitating and laughing    i am  unfortunately engaged to day to dine with mr  rochfort and sir philip  baddely  and in the evening i am to be at lady delacour s       lady delacour  not the same lady delacour whom four years ago  when we  met at florence  you compared to the venus de medici  no  no  it cannot  be the same  a goddess of four years  standing   incredible       incredible as it seems   said clarence   it is true  i admire her  ladyship more than ever i did       like a true connoisseur   said dr  x       you admire a fine picture  the older it grows  i hear that her ladyship s face is really one of the  finest pieces of painting extant  with the advantage of         ev ry grace which time alone can grant        come  come  dr  x       cried mr  percival   no more wit at lady  delacour s expense  i have a fellow feeling for mr  hervey       why  you are not in love with her ladyship  are you   said dr  x        i am not in love with lady delacour s picture of herself   replied mr   percival   but i was once in love with the original       how   when   where   cried clarence hervey  in a tone totally different  from that in which he had first addressed mr  percival      to morrow you shall know the how  the when  and the where   said mr   percival   here s your friend  mr  st  george  and his coach       the deuce take him   said clarence   but tell me  is it possible that  you are not in love with her still   and why       why   said mr  percival   why  come to morrow  as you have promised  to  upper grosvenor street  and let me introduce you to lady anne percival   she can answer your question better than i can  if not entirely to your  satisfaction  at least entirely to mine  which is more surprising  as  the lady is my wife      by this time clarence hervey was equipped in a dry suit of clothes   and by the strength of an excellent constitution  which he had never  injured  even amongst his dissipated associates  he had recovered from  the effects of his late imprudence    clary  let s away  here s the  coach   said mr  st  george   why  my boy  that s a famous fellow   faith   why  you look the better for being drowned   pon honour  if i  were you  i would jump into the serpentine river once a day       if i could always be sure of such good friends to pull me out   said  hervey    pray  st  george  by the bye  what were you  and rochfort   and sir philip  and all the rest of my friends doing  whilst i was  drowning       i can t say particularly  upon my soul   replied mr  st  george   for  my own part  i was in boots  so you know i was out of the question  but  what signifies all that now  come  come  we had best think of looking  after our dinners      clarence hervey  who had very quick feelings  was extremely hurt by  the indifference which his dear friends had shown when his life was in  danger  he was apt to believe that he was really an object of affection  and admiration amongst his companions  and that though they were neither  very wise  nor very witty  they were certainly very good natured  when  they had forfeited  by their late conduct  these claims to his regard   his partiality for them was changed into contempt      you had better come home and dine with me  mr  hervey   said mr   percival   if you be not absolutely engaged  for here is your physician   who tells me that temperance is necessary for a man just recovered from  drowning  and mr  rochfort keeps too good a table  i am told  for one in  your condition      clarence accepted of this invitation with a degree of pleasure which  perfectly astonished mr  st  george      every man knows his own affairs best   said he to clarence  as he  stepped into his hackney coach   but for my share  i will do my friend  rochfort the justice to say that no one lives as well as he does       if to live well mean nothing but to eat   said clarence      now   said dr  x      looking at his watch   it will be eight o clock  by the time we get to upper grosvenor street  and lady anne will  probably have waited dinner for us about two hours  which i apprehend  is sufficient to try the patience of any woman but griselda  do  not   continued he  turning to clarence hervey   expect to see an  old fashioned  spiritless  patient griselda  in lady anne percival  i  can assure you that she is  but i will neither tell you what she is   nor what she is not  every man who has any abilities  likes to have the  pleasure and honour of finding out a character by his own penetration   instead of having it forced upon him at full length in capital  letters of gold  finely emblazoned and illuminated by the hand of some  injudicious friend  every child thinks the violet of his own finding the  sweetest  i spare you any farther allusion and illustrations   concluded  dr  x       for here we are  thank god  in upper grosvenor street            chapter viii     a family party       they found lady anne percival in the midst of her children  who all  turned their healthy  rosy  intelligent faces towards the door  the  moment that they heard their father s voice  clarence hervey was so much  struck with the expression of happiness in lady anne s countenance  that  he absolutely forgot to compare her beauty with lady delacour s  whether  her eyes were large or small  blue or hazel  he could not tell  nay   he might have been puzzled if he had been asked the colour of her hair   whether she were handsome by the rules of art  he knew not  but he felt  that she had the essential charm of beauty  the power of prepossessing  the heart immediately in her favour  the effect of her manners  like  that of her beauty  was rather to be felt than described  every body  was at ease in her company  and none thought themselves called upon to  admire her  to clarence hervey  who had been used to the brilliant and   exigeante  lady delacour  this respite from the fatigue of admiration  was peculiarly agreeable  the unconstrained cheerfulness of lady anne  percival spoke a mind at ease  and immediately imparted happiness by  exacting sympathy  but in lady delacour s wit and gaiety there was an  appearance of art and effort  which often destroyed the pleasure that  she wished to communicate  mr  hervey was  perhaps unusually  disposed  to reflection  by having just escaped from drowning  for he had made all  these comparisons  and came to this conclusion  with the accuracy of a  metaphysician  who has been accustomed to study cause and effect  indeed  there was no species of knowledge for which he had not taste and  talents  though  to please fools  he too often affected  the bliss of  ignorance      the children at lady anne percival s happened to be looking at some gold  fish  which were in a glass globe  and dr  x      who was a general  favourite with the younger as well as with the elder part of the family   was seized upon the moment he entered the room  a pretty little girl of  five years old took him prisoner by the flap of the coat  whilst two of  her brothers assailed him with questions about the ears  eyes  and  fins of fishes  one of the little boys filliped the glass globe  and  observed  that the fish immediately came to the surface of the water   and seemed to hear the noise very quickly  but his brother doubted  whether the fish heard the noise  and remarked  that they might be  disturbed by seeing or feeling the motion of the water  when the glass  was struck     dr  x     observed  that this was a very learned dispute  and that the  question had been discussed by no less a person than the abbe nollet   and he related some of the ingenious experiments tried by that  gentleman  to decide whether fishes can or cannot hear  whilst the  doctor was speaking  clarence hervey was struck with the intelligent  countenance of one of the little auditors  a girl of about ten or twelve  years old  he was surprised to discover in her features  though not in  their expression  a singular resemblance to lady delacour  he remarked  this to mr  percival  and the child  who overheard him  blushed as red  as scarlet  dinner was announced at this instant  and clarence hervey  thought no more of the circumstance  attributing the girl s blush  to confusion at being looked at so earnestly  one of the little boys  whispered as they were going down to dinner   helena  i do believe that  this is the good natured gentleman who went out of the path to make room  for us  instead of running over us as the other man did   the children  agreed that clarence hervey certainly was the  good natured gentleman    and upon the strength of this observation  one of the boys posted  himself next to clarence at dinner  and by all the little playful  manoeuvres in his power endeavoured to show his gratitude  and to  cultivate a friendship which had been thus auspiciously commenced   mr  hervey  who piqued himself upon being able always to suit his  conversation to his companions  distinguished himself at dinner by an  account of the chinese fishing bird  from which he passed to the various  ingenious methods of fishing practised by the russian cossacks  from  modern he went to ancient fish  and he talked of that which was so much  admired by the roman epicures for exhibiting a succession of beautiful  colours whilst it is dying  and which was  upon that account   always suffered to die in the presence of the guests  as part of the  entertainment   clarence was led on by the questions of the children  from fishes to birds  he spoke of the roman aviaries  which were  so constructed as to keep from the sight of the prisoners that they  contained   the fields  woods  and every object which might remind them  of their former liberty    from birds he was going on to beasts  when he  was nearly struck dumb by the forbidding severity with which an elderly  lady  who sat opposite to him  fixed her eyes upon him  he had not   till this instant  paid the smallest attention to her  but her stern  countenance was now so strongly contrasted with the approving looks of  the children who sat next to her  that he could not help remarking it   he asked her to do him the honour to drink a glass of wine with him  she  declined doing him that honour  observing that she never drank more than  one glass of wine at dinner  and that she had just taken one with mr   percival  her manner was well bred  but haughty in the extreme  and  she was so passionate  that her anger sometimes conquered even her  politeness  her dislike to clarence hervey was apparent  even in her  silence   if the old gentlewoman has taken an antipathy to me at first  sight  i cannot help it   thought he  and he went on to the beasts  the  boy  who sat next him  had asked some questions about the proboscis of  the elephant  and mr  hervey mentioned ives s account of the elephants  in india  who have been set to watch young children  and who draw them  back gently with their trunks  when they go out of bounds  he talked  next of the unicorn  and addressing himself to dr  x     and mr   percival  he declared that in his opinion herodotus did not deserve to  be called the father of lies  he cited the mammoth to prove that  the apocryphal chapter in the history of beasts should not be  contemned  that it would in all probability be soon established as true  history  the dessert was on the table before clarence had done with the  mammoth     as the butler put a fine dish of cherries upon the table  he said      my lady  these cherries are a present from the old gardener to miss  delacour       set them before miss delacour then   said lady anne   helena  my dear   distribute your own cherries      at the name of delacour  clarence hervey  though his head was still half  full of the mammoth  looked round in astonishment  and when he saw  the cherries placed before the young lady  whose resemblance to lady  delacour he had before observed  he could not help exclaiming      that young lady then is not a daughter of your ladyship s       no  but i love her as well as if she were   replied lady anne    what  were you saying about the mammoth       that the mammoth is supposed to be              but interrupting  himself  clarence said in an inquiring tone   a  niece  of lady  delacour s       her ladyship s  daughter   sir   said the severe old lady  in a voice  more terrific than her looks      shall i give you some strawberries  mr  hervey   said lady anne   or  will you let helena help you to some cherries       her ladyship s  daughter    exclaimed clarence hervey in a tone of  surprise      some cherries  sir   said helena  but her voice faltered so much  that  she could hardly utter the words     clarence perceived that he had been the cause of her agitation  though  he knew not precisely by what means  and he now applied himself in  silence to the picking of his strawberries with great diligence     the ladies soon afterwards withdrew  and as mr  percival did not touch  upon the subject again  clarence forbore to ask any further questions   though he was considerably surprised by this sudden discovery  when he  went into the drawing room to tea  he found his friend  the stern old  lady  speaking in a high declamatory tone  the words which he heard as  he came into the room were       if there were no clarence herveys  there would be no lady  delacours    clarence bowed as if he had received a high compliment  the  old lady walked away to an antechamber  fanning herself with great  energy      mrs  margaret delacour   said lady anne  in a low voice to hervey    is an aunt of lord delacour s  a woman whose heart is warmer than her  temper       and that is never cool   said a young lady  who sat next to lady anne    i call mrs  margaret delacour the volcano  i m sure i am never in her  company without dreading an eruption  every now and then out comes with  a tremendous noise  fire  smoke  and rubbish       and precious minerals   said lady anne   amongst the rubbish       but the best of it is   continued the young lady   that she is seldom  in a passion without making a hundred mistakes  for which she is usually  obliged afterwards to ask a thousand pardons       by that account   said lady anne   which i believe to be just  her  contrition is always ten times as great as her offence       now you talk of contrition  lady anne   said mr  hervey   i should  think of my own offences  i am very sorry that my indiscreet questions  gave miss delacour any pain  my head was so full of the mammoth  that i  blundered on without seeing what i was about till it was too late       pray  sir   said mrs  margaret delacour  who now returned  and took her  seat upon a sofa  with the solemnity of a person who was going to sit in  judgment upon a criminal   pray  sir  may i ask how long you have been  acquainted with my lady delacour      clarence hervey took up a book  and with great gravity kissed it  as if  he had been upon his oath in a court of justice  and answered      to the best of my recollection  madam  it is now four years since i had  first the pleasure and honour of seeing lady delacour       and in that time  intimately as you have had the pleasure of being  acquainted with her ladyship  you have never discovered that she had a  daughter       never   said mr  hervey      there  lady anne   there   cried mrs  delacour   will you tell me after  this  that lady delacour is not a monster       every body says that she s a prodigy   said lady anne   and prodigies  and monsters are sometimes thought synonymous terms       such a mother was never heard of   continued mrs  delacour   since the  days of savage and lady macclesfield  i am convinced that she  hates   her daughter  why she never speaks of her  she never sees her  she never  thinks of her       some mothers speak more than they think of their children  and others  think more than they speak of them   said lady anne      i always thought   said mr  hervey   that lady delacour was a woman of  great sensibility       sensibility   exclaimed the indignant old lady   she has no  sensibility  sir  none  none  she who lives in a constant round of  dissipation  who performs no one duty  who exists only for herself  how  does she show her sensibility   has she sensibility for her husband  for  her daughter  for any one useful purpose upon earth   oh  how i hate the  cambric handkerchief sensibility that is brought out only to weep at a  tragedy   yes  lady delacour has sensibility enough  i grant ye  when  sensibility is the fashion  i remember well her performing the part of  a nurse with vast applause  and i remember  too  the sensibility  she showed  when the child that she nursed fell a sacrifice to her  dissipation  the second of her children  that she killed        killed   oh  surely  my dear mrs  delacour  that is too strong a word    said lady anne   you would not make a medea of lady delacour       it would have been better if i had   cried mrs  delacour   i can  understand that there may be such a thing in nature as a jealous wife   but an unfeeling mother i cannot comprehend  that passes my powers of  imagination       and mine  so much   said lady anne   that i cannot believe such a being  to exist in the world  notwithstanding all the descriptions i have  heard of it  as you say  my dear mrs  delacour  it passes my powers  of imagination  let us leave it in mr  hervey s apocryphal chapter of  animals  and he will excuse us if i never admit it into true history  at  least without some better evidence than i have yet heard       why  my dear  dear lady anne   cried mrs  delacour   i ve made this  coffee so sweet  there s no drinking it  what evidence would you have       none   said lady anne  smiling   i would have none    that is to say   you will take none   said mrs  delacour   but can any thing be stronger  evidence than her ladyship s conduct to  my  poor helen  to  your   helen  i should say  for you have educated  you have protected her  you  have been a mother to her  i am an infirm  weak  ignorant  passionate  old woman  i could not have been what you have been to that child  god  bless you   god will bless you      she rose as she spoke  to set down her coffee cup on the table  clarence  hervey took it from her with a look which said much  and which she was  perfectly capable of understanding      young man   said she   it is very unfashionable to treat age and  infirmity with politeness  i wish that your friend  lady delacour   may at my time of life meet with as much respect  as she has met  with admiration and gallantry in her youth  poor woman  her head has  absolutely been turned with admiration  and if fame say true  mr  hervey  has had his share in turning that head by his flattery       i am sure her ladyship has turned mine by her charms   said clarence    and i certainly am not to be blamed for admiring what all the world  admires       i wish   said the old lady   for her own sake  for the sake of her  family  and for the sake of her reputation  that my lady delacour had  fewer admirers  and more friends       women who have met with so many admirers  seldom meet with many  friends   said lady anne      no   said mrs  delacour   for they seldom are wise enough to know their  value       we learn the value of all things  but especially of friends  by  experience   said lady anne   and it is no wonder  therefore  that those  who have little experience of the pleasures of friendship should not be  wise enough to know their value       this is very good natured sophistry  but lady delacour is too vain ever  to have a friend   said mrs  delacour   my dear lady anne  you don t  know her as well as i do  she has more vanity than ever woman had       that is certainly saying a great deal   said lady anne   but then we  must consider  that lady delacour  as an heiress  a beauty  and a wit   has a right to a triple share at least       both her fortune and her beauty are gone  and if she had any wit left   it is time it should teach her how to conduct herself  i think   said  mrs  delacour   but i give her up  i give her up       oh  no   said lady anne   you must not give her up yet  i have been  informed  and upon  the best authority   that lady delacour was not  always the unfeeling  dissipated fine lady that she now appears to be   this is only one of the transformations of fashion  the period of her  enchantment will soon be at an end  and she will return to her natural  character  i should not be at all surprised  if lady delacour were to  appear at once  la femme comme il y en a pen        or  la bonne mere    said mrs  delacour  sarcastically   after thus  leaving her daughter           pour bonne bouche    interrupted lady anne   when she is tired of  the insipid taste of other pleasures  she will have a higher relish for  those of domestic life  which will be new and fresh to her       and so you really think  my dear lady anne  that my lady delacour will  end by being a domestic woman  well   said mrs  margaret  after taking  two pinches of snuff   some people believe in the millennium  but i  confess i am not one of them  are you  mr  hervey       if it were foretold to me by a good angel   said clarence  smiling   as his eye glanced at lady anne   if it were foretold to me by a good  angel  how could i doubt it      here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of one of lady  anne s little boys  who came running eagerly up to his mother  to ask  whether he might have  the sulphurs to show to helena delacour  i  want to show her vertumnus and pomona  mamma   said he   were not the  cherries that the old gardener sent very good       what is this about the cherries and the old gardener  charles   said  the young lady who sat beside lady anne   come here and tell me the  whole story       i will  but i should tell it you a great deal better another time    said the boy   because now helena s waiting for vertumnus and pomona       go then to helena   said lady anne   and i will tell the story for  you      then turning to the young lady she began   once upon a time there lived  an old gardener at kensington  and this old gardener had an aloe  which  was older than himself  for it was very near a hundred years of age  and  it was just going to blossom  and the old gardener calculated how much  he might make by showing his aloe  when it should be in full blow  to  the generous public  and he calculated that he might make a    l   and  with this    l  he determined to do more than was ever done with a    l   before  but  unluckily  as he was thus reckoning his blossoms before  they were blown  he chanced to meet with a fair damsel  who ruined all  his calculations       ay  mrs  stanhope s maid  was not it   interrupted mrs  margaret  delacour   a pretty damsel she was  and almost as good a politician as  her mistress  think of that jilt s tricking this poor old fellow out of  his aloe  and  oh  the meanness of lady delacour  to accept of that aloe  for one of her extravagant entertainments       but i always understood that she paid fifty guineas for it   said lady  anne      whether she did or not   said mrs  delacour   her ladyship and mrs   stanhope between them were the ruin of this poor old man  he was taken  in to marry that jade of a waiting maid  she turned out just as you  might expect from a pupil of mrs  stanhope s  the match making mrs   stanhope  you know  sir    clarence hervey changed colour    she turned  out   continued mrs  delacour   every thing that was bad  ruined her  husband  ran away from him  and left him a beggar       poor man   said clarence hervey      but now   said lady anne   let s come to the best part of the  story  mark how good comes out of evil  if this poor man had not lost  his aloe and his wife  i probably should never have been acquainted with  mrs  delacour  or with my little helena  about the time that the old  gardener was left a beggar  as i happened to be walking one fine evening  in sloane street  i met a procession of school girls  an old man begged  from them in a most moving voice  and as they passed  several of the  young ladies threw halfpence to him  one little girl  who observed that  the old man could not stoop without great difficulty  stayed behind  the rest of her companions  and collected the halfpence which they had  thrown to him  and put them into his hat  he began to tell his story  over again to her  and she stayed so long listening to it  that her  companions had turned the corner of the street  and were out of sight   she looked about in great distress  and i never shall forget the  pathetic voice with which she said   oh  what will become of me  every  body will be angry with me   i assured her that nobody should be angry  with her  and she gave me her little hand with the utmost innocent  confidence  i took her home to her schoolmistress  and i was so pleased  with the beginning of this acquaintance  that i was determined to  cultivate it  one good acquaintance i have heard always leads to  another  helena introduced me to her aunt delacour as her best friend   mrs  margaret delacour has had the goodness to let her little niece  spend the holidays and all her leisure time with me  so that our  acquaintance has grown into friendship  helena has become quite one of  my family       and i am sure she has become quite a different creature since she has  been so much with you   cried mrs  delacour   her spirits were quite  broken by her mother s neglect of her  young as she is  she has a great  deal of real sensibility  but as to her mother s sensibility       at the recollection of lady delacour s neglect of her child  mrs   delacour was going again to launch forth into indignant invective  but  lady anne stopped her  by whispering       take care what you say of the mother  for here is the daughter coming   and she has  indeed  a great deal of real sensibility      helena and her young companions now came into the room  bringing with  them the sulphurs at which they had been looking      mamma   said little charles percival   we have brought the sulphurs to  you  because there are some of them that i don t know       wonderful   said lady anne   and what is not quite so wonderful  there  are some of them that i don t know      the children spread the sulphurs upon a little table  and all the  company gathered round it      here are all the nine muses for you   said the least of the boys  who  had taken his seat by clarence hervey at dinner   here are all the muses  for you  mr  hervey  which do you like best   oh  that s the tragic muse  that you have chosen   you don t like the tragic better than the comic  muse  do you      clarence hervey made no answer  for he was at that instant recollecting  how belinda looked in the character of the tragic muse      has your ladyship ever happened to meet with the young lady who has  spent this winter with lady delacour   said clarence to lady anne      i sat near her one night at the opera   said lady anne   she has a  charming countenance       who   belinda portman  do you mean   said mrs  delacour   i am sure if  i were a young man  i would not trust to the charming countenance of a  young lady who is a pupil of mrs  stanhope s  and a friend of  helena   my dear  shut the door  the most dissipated woman in london       indeed   said lady anne   miss portman is in a dangerous situation   but some young people learn prudence by being placed in dangerous  situations  as some young horses  i have heard mr  percival say  learn  to be sure footed  by being left to pick their own way on bad roads      here mr  percival  dr  x      and some other gentlemen  came up  stairs to tea  and the conversation took another turn  clarence hervey  endeavoured to take his share in it with his usual vivacity  but he was  thinking of belinda portman  dangerous situations  stumbling horses   c   and he made several blunders  which showed his absence of mind      what have you there  mr  hervey   said dr  x      looking over his  shoulder   the tragic muse  this tragic muse seems to rival lady  delacour in your admiration       oh   said clarence  smiling   you know i was always a votary of the  muses       and a favoured votary   said dr  x       i wish for the interests of  literature  that poets may always be lovers  though i cannot say that  i desire lovers should always be poets  but  mr  hervey  you must never  marry  remember   continued dr  x       never  for your true poet must  always be miserable  you know petrarch tells us  he would not have been  happy if he could  he would not have married his mistress if it had been  in his power  because then there would have been an end of his beautiful  sonnets       every one to his taste   said clarence   for my part i have even less  ambition to imitate the heroism than hope of being inspired with the  poetic genius of petrarch  i have no wish to pass whole nights composing  sonnets  i would  am i not right  mr  percival   infinitely rather be a  slave of the ring than a slave of the lamp      here the conversation ended  clarence took his leave  and mrs  margaret  delacour said  the moment he had left the room   quite a different sort  of young man from what i had expected to see            chapter ix     advice       the next morning mr  hervey called on dr  x      and begged that he  would accompany him to lady delacour s      to be introduced to your tragic muse   said the doctor      yes   said mr  hervey   i must have your opinion of her before i devote  myself       my opinion  but of whom   of lady delacour       no  but of a young lady whom you will see with her       is she handsome       beautiful       and young       and young       and graceful       the most graceful person you ever beheld       young  beautiful  graceful  then the deuce take me   said dr  x        if i give you my opinion of her  for the odds are  that she has a  thousand faults  at least  to balance these perfections       a thousand faults  a charitable allowance   said clarence  smiling      there now   said dr  x             touch him  and no minister s so sore      to punish you for wincing at my first setting out  i promise you  that  if the lady have a million of faults  each of them high as huge olympus   i will see them as with the eye of a flatterer  not of a friend       i defy you to be so good or so bad as your word  doctor   said hervey    you have too much wit to make a good flatterer       and perhaps you think too much to make a good friend   said dr  x          not so   said clarence   i would at any time rather be cut by a sharp  knife than by a blunt one  but  my dear doctor  i hope you will not be  prejudiced against belinda  merely because she is with lady delacour   for to my certain knowledge  she in not under her ladyship s influence   she judges and acts for herself  of which i have had an instance       very possibly   interrupted dr  x       but before we go any farther   will you please to tell me of what belinda you are talking       belinda portman  i forgot that i had not told you       miss portman  a niece of mrs  stanhope s       yes  but do not be prejudiced against her on that account   said  clarence  eagerly   though i was at first myself       then you will excuse my following your example instead of your  precepts       no   said clarence   for my precepts are far better than my example      lady delacour received dr  x     most courteously  and thanked mr   hervey for introducing to her a gentleman with whom she had long desired  to converse  dr  x     had a great literary reputation  and she saw  that he was a perfectly well bred man  consequently she was ambitious  of winning his admiration  she perceived also that he had considerable  influence with clarence hervey  and this was a sufficient reason to make  her wish for his good opinion  belinda was particularly pleased with his  manners and conversation  she saw that he paid her much attention  and  she was desirous that he should think favourably of her  but she had  the good sense and good taste to avoid a display of her abilities and  accomplishments  a sensible man  who has any knowledge of the world and  talents for conversation  can easily draw out the knowledge of those  with whom he converses  dr  x     possessed this power in a superior  degree      well   cried clarence  when their visit was over   what is your opinion  of lady delacour       i am  blasted with excess of light    said the doctor      her ladyship is certainly very brilliant   said clarence   but i hope  that miss portman did not overpower you       no  i turned my eyes from lady delacour upon miss portman  as a painter  turns his eyes upon mild green  to rest them  when they have been  dazzled by glaring colours         she yields her charms of mind with sweet delay        i was afraid   said hervey   that you might think her manners too  reserved and cold  they are certainly become more so than they used to  be  but so much the better  by and by we shall find beautiful flowers  spring up from beneath the snow        a very poetical hope   said dr  x       but in judging of the human  character  we must not entirely trust to analogies and allusions taken  from the vegetable creation       what   cried clarence hervey  looking eagerly in the doctor s eyes    what do you mean  i am afraid you do not approve of belinda       your fears are almost as precipitate as your hopes  my good sir  but to  put you out of pain  i will tell you  that i approve of all i have seen  of this young lady  but that it is absolutely out of my power to form a  decisive judgment of a woman s temper and character in the course of a  single morning visit  women  you know  as well as men  often speak with  one species of enthusiasm  and act with another  i must see your belinda  act  i must study her  before i can give you my final judgment  lady  delacour has honoured me with her commands to go to her as often as  possible  for your sake  my dear hervey  i shall obey her ladyship most  punctually  that i may have frequent opportunities of seeing your miss  portman      clarence expressed his gratitude with much energy  for this instance  of the doctor s friendship  belinda  who had been entertained by dr   x     s conversation during this first visit  was more and more  delighted with his company as she became more acquainted with his  understanding and character  she felt that he unfolded her powers  and  that with the greatest politeness and address he raised her confidence  in herself  without ever descending to flattery  by degrees she  learned to look upon him as a friend  she imparted to him with great  ingenuousness her opinions on various subjects  and she was both amused  and instructed by his observations on the characters and manners of the  company who frequented lady delacour s assemblies  she did not judge of  the doctor s sincerity merely by the kindness he showed her  but by his  conduct towards others     one night  at a select party at lady delacour s  a spanish gentleman  was amusing the company with some anecdotes  to prove the extraordinary  passion which some of his countrymen formerly showed for the game of  chess  he mentioned families  in which unfinished games  bequeathed by  will  had descended from father to son  and where victory was doubtful  for upwards of a century     mr  hervey observed  that gaining a battle was  at that time  so common  to the court of spain  that a victory at chess seemed to confer more   eclat   for that an abbe  by losing adroitly a game at chess to the  spanish minister  obtained a cardinal s hat     the foreigner was flattered by the manner in which hervey introduced  this slight circumstance  and he directed to him his conversation   speaking in french and italian successively  he was sufficiently skilled  in both languages  but clarence spoke them better  till he appeared   the foreigner was the principal object of attention  but he was soon  eclipsed by mr  hervey  nothing amusing or instructive that could be  said upon the game of chess escaped him  and the literary ground  which  the slow don would have taken some hours to go regularly over  our  hero traversed in a few minutes  from twiss to vida  from irwin to sir  william jones  from spain to india  he passed with admirable celerity   and seized all that could adorn his course from indian antiquities or  asiatic researches     by this display of knowledge he surprised even his friend dr  x       the ladies admired his taste as a poet  the gentlemen his accuracy as a  critic  lady delacour loudly applauded  and belinda silently approved   clarence was elated  the spanish gentleman  to whom he had just quoted  a case in point from vida s scacchia  asked him if he were as perfect  in the practice as in the theory of the game  clarence was too proud of  excelling in every thing to decline the spaniard s challenge  they sat  down to chess  lady delacour  as they ranged the pieces on the board   cried   whoever wins shall be my knight  and a silver chess man shall be  his prize  was it not queen elizabeth who gave a silver chess man to one  of her courtiers as a mark of her royal favour  i am ashamed to imitate  such a pedantic coquet  but since i have said it  how can i retract       impossible  impossible   cried clarence hervey   a silver chess man be  our prize  and if i win it  like the gallant raleigh  i will wear it in  my cap  and what proud essex shall dare to challenge it      the combat now began  the spectators were silent  clarence made an error  in his first move  for his attention was distracted by seeing belinda  behind his adversary s chair  the spaniard was deceived by this mistake  into a contemptuous opinion of his opponent  belinda changed her  place  clarence recovered his presence of mind  and convinced him that  he was not a man to be despised  the combat was long doubtful  but at  length to the surprise of all present  clarence hervey was victorious     exulting in his success  he looked round for lady delacour  from whom he  expected the honours of his triumph  she had left the room  but soon she  returned  dressed in the character of queen elizabeth  in which she had  once appeared at a masquerade  with a large ruff  and all the costume of  the times     clarence hervey  throwing himself at her feet  addressed her in that  high flown style which her majesty was wont to hear from the gallant  raleigh  or the accomplished essex     soon the coquetry of the queen entirely conquered her prudery  and  the favoured courtier  evidently elated by his situation  was as  enthusiastic as her majesty s most insatiable vanity could desire  the  characters were well supported  both the actor and actress were  highly animated  and seemed so fully possessed by their parts as to  be insensible to the comments that were made upon the scene  clarence  hervey was first recalled to himself by the deep blush which he saw on  belinda s cheek  when queen elizabeth addressed her as one of her maids  of honour  of whom she affected to be jealous  he was conscious that he  had been hurried by the enthusiasm of the moment farther than he either  wished or intended  it was difficult to recede  when her majesty seemed  disposed to advance  but sir walter raleigh  with much presence of mind   turned to the foreigner  whom he accosted as the spanish ambassador      your excellency sees   said he   how this great queen turns the heads  of her faithful subjects  and afterwards has the art of paying them  with nothing but words  has the new world afforded you any coin half so  valuable      the spanish gentleman s grave replies to this playful question gave  a new turn to the conversation  and relieved clarence hervey from his  embarrassment  lady delacour  though still in high spirits  was easily  diverted to other objects  she took the spaniard with her to the  next room  to show him a picture of mary  queen of scots  the company  followed her  clarence hervey remained with dr  x     and belinda  who  had just asked the doctor  to teach her the moves at chess      lady delacour has charming spirits   said clarence hervey   they  inspire every body with gaiety       every body  they incline me more to melancholy than mirth   said dr   x       these high spirits do not seem quite natural  the vivacity of  youth and of health  miss portman  always charms me  but this gaiety of  lady delacour s does not appear to me that of a sound mind in a sound  body      the doctor s penetration went so near the truth  that belinda  afraid  of betraying her friend s secrets  never raised her eyes from the  chess board whilst he spoke  but went on setting up the fallen castles   and bishops  and kings  with expeditious diligence      you are putting the bishop into the place of the knight   said  clarence      lady delacour   continued the doctor   seems to be in a perpetual  fever  either of mind or body  i cannot tell which  and as a  professional man  i really have some curiosity to determine the  question  if i could feel her pulse  i could instantly decide  but i  have heard her say that she has a horror against having her pulse felt   and a lady s horror is invincible  by reason        but not by address   said clarence   i can tell you a method of  counting her pulse  without her knowing it  without her seeing you   without your seeing her       indeed   said dr  x      smiling   that may be a useful secret in my  profession  pray impart it to me  you who excel in every thing       are you in earnest  mr  hervey   said belinda      perfectly in earnest  my secret is quite simple  look through the door  at the shadow of queen elizabeth s ruff  observe how it vibrates  the  motion as well as the figure is magnified in the shadow  cannot you  count every pulsation distinctly       i can   said dr  x       and i give you credit for making an ingenious  use of a trifling observation   the doctor paused and looked round    those people cannot hear what we are saying  i believe       oh  no   said belinda   they are intent upon themselves   doctor  x    fixed his eyes mildly upon clarence hervey  and exclaimed in an  earnest friendly tone   what a pity  mr  hervey  that a young man  of your talents and acquirements  a man who might be any thing   should  pardon the expression  choose to be  nothing  should waste upon  petty objects powers suited to the greatest  should lend his soul  to every contest for frivolous superiority  when the same energy  concentrated might ensure honourable pre eminence among the first men  in his country  shall he who might not only distinguish himself in any  science or situation  who might not only acquire personal fame  but   oh  far more noble motive  who might be permanently useful to his  fellow creatures  content himself with being the evanescent amusement  of a drawing room   shall one  who might be great in public  or happy  in private life  waste in this deplorable manner the best years of his  existence  time that can never be recalled   this is declamation   no   it is truth put into the strongest language that i have power to use  in  the hope of making some impression  i speak from my heart  for i have a  sincere regard for you  mr  hervey  and if i have been impertinent  you  must forgive me       forgive you   cried clarence hervey  taking dr  x     by the hand   i  think you a real friend  you shall have the best thanks not in words   but in actions  you have roused my ambition  and i will pursue noble  ends by noble means  a few years have been sacrificed  but the lessons  that they have taught me remain  i cannot  presumptuous as i am   flatter myself that my exertions can be of any material utility to my  fellow creatures  but what i can do i will  my excellent friend  if i be  hereafter either successful in public  or happy in private life  it is  to you i shall owe it      belinda was touched by the candour and good sense with which clarence  hervey spoke  his character appeared in a new light  she was proud of  her own judgment  in having discerned his merit  and for a moment she  permitted herself to feel  unreproved pleasure in his company      the next morning  sir philip baddely and mr  rochfort called at lady  delacour s  mr  hervey was present  her ladyship was summoned to mrs   franks  and belinda was left with these gentlemen      why  damme  clary  you have been a lost man   cried sir philip   ever  since you were drowned  damme  why did not you come to dine with us  that day  now i recollect it  we were all famously merry  but for your  comfort  clarence  we missed you cursedly  and were damned sorry you  ever took that unlucky jump into the serpentine river  damned sorry   were not we  rochfort       oh   said clarence  in an ironical tone   you need no vouchers to  convince me of the reality of your sorrow  you know i can never forget  your jumping so courageously into the river  to save the life of your  friend       oh  pooh  damn it   said sir philip   what signifies who pulled you  out  now you are safe and sound  by the bye  clary  did you ever quiz  that doctor  as i desired you  no  that i m sure you didn t  but i think  he has made a quiz of you  for  damme  i believe you have taken such a  fancy to the old quizzical fellow  that you can t live without him  miss  portman  don t you admire hervey s taste       in this instance i certainly do admire mr  hervey s taste   said  belinda   for the best of all possible reasons  because it entirely  agrees with my own       very extraordinary  faith   said sir philip      and what the devil can you find to like in him  clary   continued mr   rochfort   for one wouldn t be so rude to put that question to a lady   ladies  you know  are never to be questioned about their likings and  dislikings  some have pet dogs  some have pet cats  then why not a  pet  quiz        ha  ha  ha  that s a good one  rochfort  a pet quiz   ha  ha  ha  dr   x     shall be miss portman s pet quiz  put it about  put it about   rochfort   continued the witty baronet  and he and his facetious  companion continued to laugh as long as they possibly could at this  happy hit     belinda  without being in the least discomposed by their insolent folly   as soon as they had finished laughing  very coolly observed  that she  could have no objection to give her reasons for preferring dr  x     s  company but for fear they might give offence to sir philip and his  friends  she then defended the doctor with so much firmness  and yet  with so much propriety  that clarence hervey was absolutely enchanted  with her  and with his own penetration in having discovered her real  character  notwithstanding her being mrs  stanhope s niece      i never argue  for my part   cried mr  rochfort    pon honour   tis a  deal too much trouble  a lady  a handsome lady  i mean  is always in the  right with me       but as to you  hervey   said sir philip   damme  do you know  my boy   that our club has come to a determination to black ball you  if you keep  company with this famous doctor       your club  sir philip  will do me honour by such an ostracism       ostracism   repeated sir philip    in plain english  does that mean  that you choose to be black balled by us  why  damn it  clary  you ll  be nobody  but follow your own genius  damn me  if i take it upon me to  understand your men of genius  they are in the serpentine river one day   and in the clouds the next  so fare ye well  clary  i expect to see you  a doctor of physic  or a methodist parson  soon  damn me if i don t   so fare ye well  clary  is black ball your last word  or will you think  better on t  and give up the doctor       i can never give up dr  x     s friendship  i would sooner be  black balled by every club in london  the good lesson you gave me  sir  philip  the day i was fool enough to jump into the serpentine river  has  made me wiser for life  i know  for i have felt  the difference between  real friends and fashionable acquaintance  give up dr  x      never   never       then fare you well  clary   said sir philip   you re no longer one of  us       then fare ye well  clary  you re no longer the man for me   said  rochfort       tant pis   and  tant mieux   said clarence  and so they parted     as they left the room  clarence hervey involuntarily turned to belinda   and he thought that he read in her ingenuous  animated countenance  full  approbation of his conduct      hist  are they gone  quite gone   said lady delacour  entering the room  from an adjoining apartment   they have stayed an unconscionable time   how much i am obliged to mrs  franks for detaining me  i have escaped  their vapid impertinence  and in truth  this morning i have such a  multiplicity of business  that i have scarcely a moment even for wit  and clarence hervey  belinda  my dear  will you have the charity to look  over some of these letters for me  which  as marriott tells me  have  been lying in my writing table this week  expecting  most unreasonably   that i should have the grace to open them  we are always punished for  our indolence  as your friend dr  x     said the other day  if we suffer  business to accumulate  it drifts with every ill wind like snow  till  at last an avalanche of it comes down at once  and quite overwhelms us   excuse me  clarence   continued her ladyship  as she opened her letters    this is very rude  but i know i have secured my pardon from you by  remembering your friend s wit  wisdom  i should say  how seldom are  wit and wisdom joined  they might have been joined in lady delacour   perhaps  there s vanity   if she had early met with such a friend as dr   x      but it s too late now   said she  with a deep sigh     clarence hervey heard it  and it made a great impression upon his  benevolent imagination   why too late   said he to himself   mrs   margaret delacour is mistaken  if she thinks this woman wants  sensibility       what have you got there  miss portman   said lady delacour  taking from  belinda s hand one of the letters which she had begged her to look  over   something wondrous pathetic  i should guess  by your countenance     helena delacour    oh  read it to yourself  my dear  a school girl s  letter is a thing i abominate  i make it a rule never to read helena s  epistles       let me prevail upon your ladyship to make an exception to the general  rule then   said belinda   i can assure you this is not a common  school girl s letter  miss delacour seems to inherit her mother s    eloquence de billet         miss portman seems to possess  by inheritance  by instinct  by magic   or otherwise  powers of persuasion  which no one can resist  there s  compliment for compliment  my dear  is there any thing half so well  turned in helena s letter  really   tis vastly well   continued her  ladyship  as she read the letter   where did the little gipsy learn to  write so charmingly  i protest i should like of all things to have her  at home with me this summer  the   st of june  well  after the birthday   i shall have time to think about it  but then  we shall be going out of  town  and at harrowgate i should not know what to do with her  she had  better  much better  go to her humdrum aunt margaret s  as she always  does  she is a fixture in grosvenor square  these stationary good  people  these zoophite friends  are sometimes very convenient  and mrs   margaret delacour is the most unexceptionable zoophite in the creation   she has  it is true  an antipathy to me  because i m of such a different  nature from herself  but then her antipathy does not extend to my  offspring  she is kind beyond measure to helena  on purpose  i believe   to provoke me  now i provoke her in my turn  by never being provoked   and she saves me a vast deal of trouble  for which she is overpaid by  the pleasure of abusing me  this is the way of the world  clarence   don t look so serious  you are not come yet to daughters and sons  and  schools and holidays  and all the evils of domestic life       evils   repeated clarence hervey  in a tone which surprised her  ladyship  she looked immediately with a significant smile at belinda    why do not you echo  evils   miss portman       pray  lady delacour   interrupted clarence hervey   when do you go to  harrowgate       what a sudden transition   said lady delacour   what association of  ideas could just at that instant take you to harrowgate  when do i go to  harrowgate  immediately after the birthday  i believe we shall  i advise  you to be of the party       your ladyship does me a great deal of honour   said hervey   i shall   if it be possible  do myself the honour of attending you      and soon after this arrangement was made  mr  hervey took his leave      well  my dear  are you still poring over that letter of helena s   said  lady delacour to miss portman      i fancy your ladyship did not quite finish it   said belinda      no  i saw something about the leverian museum  and a swallow s nest in  a pair of garden shears  and i was afraid i was to have a catalogue of  curiosities  for which i have little taste and less time       you did not see  then  what miss delacour says of the lady who took her  to that museum       not i  what lady  her aunt margaret       no  mrs  margaret delacour  she says  has been so ill for some time  past  that she goes no where but to lady anne percival s       poor woman   said lady delacour   she will die soon  and then i shall  have helena upon my hands  unless some other kind friend takes a fancy  to her  who is this lady that has carried her to the leverian museum       lady anne percival  of whom she speaks with so much gratitude and  affection  that i quite long          lord bless me   interrupted lady delacour   lady anne percival  helena  has mentioned this lady anne percival to me before  i recollect  in some  of her letters       then you did read some of her letters       half   i never read more than half  upon my word   said lady delacour   laughing      why will you delight in making yourself appear less good than you are   my dear lady delacour   said belinda  taking her hand      because i hate to be like other people   said her ladyship   who  delight in making themselves appear better than they are  but i was  going to tell you  that i do believe i did provoke percival by marrying  lord delacour  i cannot tell you how much this mea delights me  i am  sure that the man has a lively remembrance of me  or else he would never  make his wife take so much notice of my daughter       surely  your ladyship does not think   said belinda   that a wife is a  being whose actions are necessarily governed by a husband       not necessarily  but accidentally  when a lady accidentally sets up for  being a good wife  she must of course love  honour  and obey  now  you  understand  i am not in the least obliged to lady anne for her kindness  to helena  because it all goes under the head of obedience  in my  imagination  and her ladyship is paid for it by an accession of  character  she has the reward of having it said   oh  lady anne percival  is the best wife in the world     oh  lady anne percival is quite a  pattern woman   i hate pattern women  i hope i may never see lady  anne  for i m sure i should detest her beyond all things living  mrs   luttridge not excepted      belinda was surprised and shocked at the malignant vehemence with which  her ladyship uttered these words  it was in vain  however  that she  remonstrated on the injustice of predetermining to detest lady anne   merely because she had shown kindness to helena  and because she bore a  high character  lady delacour was a woman who never listened to reason   or who listened to it only that she might parry it by wit  upon this  occasion  her wit had not its usual effect upon miss portman  instead of  entertaining  it disgusted her      you have called me your friend  lady delacour   said she   i should but  ill deserve that name  if i had not the courage to speak the truth to  you  if i had not the courage to tell you when i think you are wrong       but i have not the courage to hear you  my dear   said lady delacour   stopping her ears   so your conscience may be at ease  you may suppose  that you have said every thing that is wise  and good  and proper  and  sublime  and that you deserve to be called the best of friends  you  shall enjoy the office of censor to lady delacour  and welcome  but  remember  it is a sinecure place  though i will pay you with my love and  esteem to any extent you please  you sigh  for my folly  alas  my dear    tis hardly worth while  my follies will soon be at an end  of what use  could even the wisdom of solomon be to me now  if you have any humanity   you will not force me to reflect  whilst i yet live  i must  keep it  up  with incessant dissipation  the teetotum keeps upright only while it  spins  so let us talk of the birthnight  or the new play that we are to  see to night  or the ridiculous figure lady h     made at the concert   or let us talk of harrowgate  or what you will      pity succeeded to disgust and displeasure in belinda s mind  and she  could hardly refrain from tears  whilst she saw this unhappy creature   with forced smiles  endeavour to hide the real anguish of her soul  she  could only say   but  my dear lady delacour  do not you think that your  little helena  who seems to have a most affectionate disposition  would  add to your happiness at home       her affectionate disposition can be nothing to me   said lady delacour     belinda felt a hot tear drop upon her hand  which lay upon lady  delacour s lap      can you wonder   continued her ladyship  hastily wiping away the tear  which she had let fall   can you wonder that i should talk of detesting  lady anne percival  you see she has robbed me of the affections of my  child  helena asks to come home  yes  but how does she ask it  coldly   formally   as a duty  but look at the end of her letter  i have read  it all  every bitter word of it i have tasted  how differently she  writes  look even at the flowing hand  the moment she begins to speak of  lady anne percival  then her soul breaks out   lady anne has offered  to take her to oakly park  she should be extremely happy to go  if i  please   yes  let her go  let her go as far from me as possible  let her  never  never see her wretched mother more   write   said lady delacour   turning hastily to belinda   write in my name  and tell her to go to  oakly park  and to be happy       but why should you take it for granted that she cannot be happy with  you   said belinda   let us see her  let us try the experiment       no   said lady delacour   no  it is too late  i will never condescend  in my last moments to beg for that affection to which it may be thought  i have forfeited my natural claim      pride  anger  and sorrow  struggled in her countenance as she spoke  she  turned her face from belinda  and walked out of the room with dignity     nothing remains for me to do  thought belinda  but to sooth this haughty  spirit  all other hope  i see  is vain     at this moment clarence hervey  who had no suspicion that the gay   brilliant lady delacour was sinking into the grave  had formed a design  worthy of his ardent and benevolent character  the manner in which her  ladyship had spoken of his friend dr  x      the sigh which she gave  at the reflection that she might have been a very different character  if she had early had a sensible friend  made a great impression upon mr   hervey  till then  he had merely considered her ladyship as an object  of amusement  and an introduction to high life  but he now felt so much  interested for her  that he determined to exert all his influence to  promote her happiness  he knew  that  influence to be considerable  not  that he was either coxcomb or dupe enough to imagine that lady delacour  was in love with him  he was perfectly sensible that her only wish was  to obtain his admiration  and he resolved to show her that it could no  longer be secured without deserving his esteem  clarence hervey was  a thoroughly generous young man  capable of making the greatest  sacrifices  when encouraged by the hope of doing good  he determined  to postpone the declaration of his attachment to belinda  that he might  devote himself entirely to his new project  his plan was to wean lady  delacour by degrees from dissipation  by attaching her to her daughter   and to lady anne percival  he was sanguine in all his hopes  and rapid   but not unthinking  in all his decisions  from lady delacour he went  immediately to dr  x      to whom he communicated his designs      i applaud your benevolent intentions   said the doctor   but have  you really the presumption to hope  that an ingenuous young man of  four and twenty can reform a veteran coquet of four and thirty       lady delacour is not yet thirty   said clarence   but the older she  is  the better the chance of her giving up a losing game  she has an  admirable understanding  and she will soon  i mean as soon as she is  acquainted with lady anne percival  discover that she has mistaken  the road to happiness  all the difficulty will be to make them fairly  acquainted with each other  for this  my dear doctor  i must trust to  you  do you prepare lady anne to tolerate lady delacour s faults  and i  will prepare lady delacour to tolerate lady anne s virtues       you have generously taken the more difficult task of the two   replied  dr  x       well  we shall see what can be done  after the birthday   lady delacour talks of going to harrowgate  you know  oakly park is  not far from harrowgate  so they will have frequent opportunities of  meeting  but  take my word for it  nothing can be done till after  the birthday  for lady delacour s head is at present full of crape  petticoats  and horses  and carriages  and a certain mrs  luttridge   whom she hates with a hatred passing that of women            chapter x     the mysterious boudoir       accustomed to study human nature  dr  x     had acquired peculiar  sagacity in judging of character  notwithstanding the address with which  lady delacour concealed the real motives for her apparently thoughtless  conduct  he quickly discovered that the hatred of mrs  luttridge was her  ruling passion  above nine years of continual warfare had exasperated  the tempers of both parties  and no opportunities of manifesting their  mutual antipathy were ever neglected  extravagantly as lady delacour  loved admiration  the highest possible degree of positive praise was  insipid to her taste  if it did not imply some superiority over the  woman whom she considered as a perpetual rival     now it had been said by the coachmaker  that mrs  luttridge would sport  a most elegant new vis a vis on the king s birthday  lady delacour  was immediately ambitious to outshine her in equipage  and it was this  paltry ambition that made her condescend to all the meanness of the  transaction by which she obtained miss portman s draft  and clarence  hervey s two hundred guineas  the great  the important day  at length  arrived  her ladyship s triumph in the morning at the drawing room  was complete  mrs  luttridge s dress  mrs  luttridge s vis a vis  mrs   luttridge s horses were nothing  absolutely nothing  in comparison with  lady delacour s  her ladyship enjoyed the full exultation of vanity  and  at night she went in high spirits to the ball      oh  my dearest belinda   said she  as she left her dressing room   how  terrible a thing it is that you cannot go with me   none of the joys of  this life are without alloy    twould be too much to see in one night  mrs  luttridge s mortification  and my belinda s triumph  adieu   my love  we shall live to see another birthday  it is to be hoped   marriott  my drops  oh  i have taken them      belinda  after her ladyship s departure  retired to the library  her  time passed so agreeably during lady delacour s absence  that she was  surprised when she heard the clock strike twelve      is it possible   thought she   that i have spent two hours by myself  in a library without being tired of my existence   how different are my  feelings now from what they would have been in the same circumstances  six months ago   i should then have thought the loss of a birthnight  ball a mighty trial of temper  it is singular  that my having spent  a winter with one of the most dissipated women in england should have  sobered my mind so completely  if i had never seen the utmost extent  of the pleasures of the world  as they are called  my imagination might  have misled me to the end of my life  but now i can judge from my own  experience  and i am convinced that the life of a fine lady would never  make me happy  dr  x     told me  the other day  that he thinks me  formed for something better  and he is incapable of flattery      the idea of clarence hervey was so intimately connected with that of his  friend  that miss portman could seldom separate them in her imagination   and she was just beginning to reflect upon the manner in which clarence  looked  whilst he declared to sir philip baddely  that he would never  give up dr  x      when she was startled by the entrance of marriott      oh  miss portman  what shall we do  what shall we do  my lady  my poor  lady   cried she      what is the matter   said belinda      the horses  the young horses   oh  i wish my lady had never seen them   oh  my lady  my poor lady  what will become of her      it was some minutes before belinda could obtain from marriott any  intelligible account of what had happened      all i know  ma am  is what james has just told me   said marriott   my  lady gave the coachman orders upon no account to let mrs  luttridge s  carriage get before hers  mrs  luttridge s coachman would not give up  the point either  my lady s horses were young and ill broke  they tell  me  and there was no managing of them no ways  the carriages got somehow  across one another  and my lady was overturned  and all smashed to  atoms  oh  ma am   continued marriott   if it had not been for mr   hervey  they say  my lady would never have been got out of the crowd  alive  he s bringing her home in his own carriage  god bless him       but is lady delacour hurt   cried belinda      she  must    to be sure  she must  ma am   cried marriott  putting her  hand upon her bosom   but let her be ever so much hurt  my lady will  keep it to herself  the footmen swear she did not give a scream  not a  single scream  so it s their opinion she was no ways hurt  but that   i know  can t be  and  indeed  they are thinking so much about the  carriage  that they can t give one any rational account of any thing   and  as for myself  i m sure i m in such a flutter  lord knows  i  advised my lady not to go with the young horses  no later than        hark   cried belinda   here they are   she ran down stairs instantly   the first object that she saw was lady delacour in convulsions  the  street door was open  the hall was crowded with servants  belinda made  her way through them  and  in a calm voice  requested that lady delacour  might immediately be brought to her own dressing room  and that she  should there be left to marriott s care and hers  mr  hervey assisted in  carrying lady delacour  she came to her senses as they were taking her  up stairs   set me down  set me down   she exclaimed   i am not hurt  i  am quite well   where s marriott  where s miss portman       here we are  you shall be carried quite safely  trust to me   said  belinda  in a firm tone   and do not struggle      lady delacour submitted  she was in agonizing pain  but her fortitude  was so great that she never uttered a groan  it was the constraint which  she had put upon herself  by endeavouring not to scream  which threw her  into convulsions   she is hurt  i am sure she is hurt  though she will  not acknowledge it   cried clarence hervey   my ankle is sprained   that s all   said lady delacour   lay me on this sofa  and leave me to  belinda       what s all this   cried lord delacour  staggering into the room  he was  much intoxicated  and in this condition had just come home  as they were  carrying lady delacour up stairs  he could not be made to understand the  truth  but as soon as he heard clarence hervey s voice  he insisted upon  going up to  his wife s  dressing room  it was a very unusual thing  but  neither champfort nor any one else could restrain him  the moment that  he had formed this idea  he forced his way into the room      what s all this   colonel lawless   said he  addressing himself to  clarence hervey  whom  in the confusion of his mind  he mistook for the  colonel  the first object of his jealousy   colonel lawless   cried his  lordship   you are a villain  i always knew it       softly   she s in great pain  my lord   said belinda  catching lord  delacour s arm  just as he was going to strike clarence hervey  she led  him to the sofa where lady delacour lay  and uncovering her ankle  which  was much swelled  showed it to him  his lordship  who was a humane man   was somewhat moved by this appeal to his remaining senses  and he began  roaring as loud as he possibly could for arquebusade     lady delacour rested her head upon the back of the sofa  her hands moved  with convulsive twitches  she was perfectly silent  marriott was in a  great bustle  running backwards and forwards for she knew not what   and continually repeating   i wish nobody would come in here but miss  portman and me  my lady says nobody must come in  lord bless me  my lord  here too       have you any arquebusade  marriott  arquebusade  for your lady   directly   cried his lordship  following her to the door of the boudoir   where she was going for some drops      oh  my lord  you can t come in  i assure you  my lord  there s nothing  here  my lord  nothing of the sort   said marriott  setting her back  against the door  her terror and embarrassment instantly recalled all  the jealous suspicions of lord delacour   woman   cried he   i  will   see whom you have in this room   you have some one concealed there  and  i  will  go in   then with brutal oaths he dragged marriott from the  door  and snatched the key from her struggling hand     lady delacour started up  and gave a scream of agony   my lord   lord  delacour   cried belinda  springing forward   hear me      lord delacour stopped short   tell me  then   cried lord delacour    is not a lover of lady delacour s concealed there    no   no   no    answered belinda   then a lover of miss portman   said lord delacour    gad  we have hit it now  i believe       believe whatever you please  my lord   said belinda  hastily   but give  me the key      clarence hervey drew the key from lord delacour s hand  gave it to miss  portman without looking at her  and immediately withdrew  lord delacour  followed him with a sort of drunken laugh  and no one remained in the  room but marriott  belinda  and lady delacour  marriott was so much   fluttered   as she said  that she could do nothing  miss portman locked  the room door  and began to undress lady delacour  who lay motionless    are we by ourselves   said lady delacour  opening her eyes      yes  are you much hurt   said belinda   oh  you are a charming girl    said lady delacour   who would have thought you had so much presence of  mind and courage  have you the key safe    here it is   said belinda   producing it  and she repeated her question   are you much hurt    i am  not in pain now   said lady delacour   but i  have  suffered terribly   if i could get rid of all this finery  if you could put me to bed  i  could sleep perhaps      whilst belinda was undressing lady delacour  she shrieked several times   but between every interval of pain she repeated   i shall be better  to morrow   as soon as she was in bed  she desired marriott to give  her double her usual quantity of laudanum  for that all the inclination  which she had felt to sleep was gone  and that she could not endure the  shooting pains that she felt in her breast      leave me alone with your lady  marriott   said miss portman  taking  the bottle of laudanum from her trembling hand   and go to bed  for i am  sure you are not able to sit up any longer      as she spoke  she took marriott into the adjoining dressing room   oh   dear miss portman   said marriott  who was sincerely attached to her  lady  and who at this instant forgot all her jealousies  and all her  love of power   i ll do any thing you ask me  but pray let me stay in  the room  though i know i m quite helpless  it will be too much for you  to be here all night by yourself  the convulsions may take my lady   what shrieks she gives every now and then   and nobody knows what s the  matter but ourselves  and every body in the house is asking me why a  surgeon is not sent for  if my lady is so much hurt  oh  i can t answer  for it to my conscience  to have kept the matter secret so long  for to  be sure a physician  if had in time  might have saved my lady  but now  nothing can save her   and here marriott burst into tears      why don t you give me the laudanum   cried lady delacour  in a loud  peremptory voice   give it to me instantly     no   said miss portman   firmly    hear me  lady delacour  you must allow me to judge  for you  know that you are not in a condition to judge for yourself  or rather  you must allow me to send for a physician  who may judge for us both       a physician   cried lady delacour   never  never  i charge you let  no physician be sent for  remember your promise  you  cannot  betray  me  you  will  not betray me       no   said belinda   of that i have given sufficient proof  but you will  betray yourself  it is already known by your servants that you have  been hurt by the overturn of your carriage  if you do not let either a  surgeon or physician see you it will excite surprise and suspicion   it is not in your power  when violent pain seizes you  to refrain  from               it is   interrupted lady delacour   not another scream shall you  hear  only do not  do not  my dear belinda  send for a physician       you will throw yourself again into convulsions   said belinda    marriott  you see  has lost all command of herself  i shall not have  strength to manage you   perhaps i may lose my presence of mind  i  cannot answer for myself  your husband may desire to see you       no danger of that   said lady delacour   tell him my ankle is  sprained  tell him i am bruised all over  tell him any thing you  will  he will not trouble himself any more about me  he will forget all  that passed to night by the time he is sober  oh  give me the laudanum   dearest belinda  and say no more about physicians      it was in vain to reason with lady delacour  belinda attempted to  persuade her   for my sake  dear lady delacour   said she   let me send  for dr  x      he is a man of honour  your secret will be perfectly  safe with him       he will tell it to clarence hervey   said lady delacour   of all men  living  i would not send for dr  x      i will not see him if he  comes       then   said belinda  calmly  but with a fixed determination of  countenance   i must leave you to morrow morning  i must return to  bath       leave me  remember your promise       circumstances have occurred  about which i have made no promise   said  belinda   i must leave you  unless you will now give me your permission  to send for dr  x          lady delacour hesitated   you see   continued belinda   that i am in  earnest  when i am gone  you will have no friend left  when i am gone   your secret will inevitably be discovered  for without me  marriott will  not have sufficient strength of mind to keep it       do you think we might trust dr  x       said lady delacour      i am sure you may trust him   said belinda  with energy   i will pledge  my life upon his honour       then send for him  since it must be so   said lady delacour     no sooner had the words passed lady delacour s lips than belinda flew  to execute her orders  marriott recovered her senses when she heard that  her ladyship had consented to send for a physician  but she declared  that she could not conceive how any thing less than the power of magic  could have brought her lady to such a determination     belinda had scarcely despatched a servant for dr  x      when lady  delacour repented of the permission she had given  and all that could  be said to pacify only irritated her temper  she became delirious   belinda s presence of mind never forsook her  she remained quietly  beside the bed waiting for the arrival of dr  x      and she absolutely  refused admittance to the servants  who  drawn by their lady s  outrageous cries  continually came to her door with offers of  assistance     about four o clock the doctor arrived  and miss portman was relieved  from some of her anxiety  he assured her that there was no immediate  danger  and he promised that the secret which she had entrusted to him  should be faithfully kept  he remained with her some hours  till lady  delacour became more quiet and fell asleep  exhausted with delirious  exertions    i think i may now leave you   said dr  x      but as he was  going through the dressing room  belinda stopped him    now that i have  time to think of myself   said she   let me consult you as my friend  i  am not used to act entirely for myself  and i shall be most grateful if  you will assist me with your advice  i hate all mysteries  but i feel  myself bound in honour to keep the secret with which lady delacour  has entrusted me  last night i was so circumstanced  that i could not  extricate her ladyship without exposing myself to  to suspicion      miss portman then related all that had passed about the mysterious door   which lord delacour  in his fit of drunken jealousy  had insisted upon  breaking open      mr  hervey   continued belinda   was present when all this happened  he  seemed much surprised  i should be sorry that he should remain in an  error which might be fatal to my reputation  you know a woman ought  not even to be suspected  yet how to remove this suspicion i know not   because i cannot enter into any explanation  without betraying lady  delacour  she has  i know  a peculiar dread of mr  hervey s discovering  the truth       and is it possible   cried dr  x       that any woman should be so  meanly selfish  as thus to expose the reputation of her friend merely to  preserve her own vanity from mortification       hush  don t speak so loud   said belinda   you will awaken her  and at  present she is certainly more an object of pity than of indignation   if  you will have the goodness to come with me  i will take you by a back  staircase up to the  mysterious boudoir   i am not too proud to give  positive proofs of my speaking truth  the key of that room now lies on  lady delacour s bed  it was that which she grasped in her hand during  her delirium  she has now let it fall  it opens both the doors of the  boudoir  you shall see   added miss portman  with a smile   that i am  not afraid to let you unlock either of them       as a polite man   said dr  x       i believe that i should  absolutely refuse to take any external evidence of a lady s truth  but  demonstration is unanswerable even by enemies  and i will not sacrifice  your interests to the foppery of my politeness  so i am ready to follow  you  the curiosity of the servants may have been excited by last night s  disturbance  and i see no method so certain as that which you propose of  preventing busy rumour  that goddess  let ovid say what he pleases  was  born and bred in a kitchen  or a servants  hall   but   continued  dr  x       my dear miss portman  you will put a stop to a number  of charming stories by this prudence of yours  a romance called the  mysterious boudoir  of nine volumes at least  might be written on this  subject  if you would only condescend to act like almost all other  heroines  that is to say  without common sense      the doctor now followed belinda  and satisfied himself by ocular  demonstration  that this cabinet was the retirement of disease  and not  of pleasure     it was about eight o clock in the morning when dr  x     got home  he  found clarence hervey waiting for him  clarence seemed to be in great  agitation  though he endeavoured  with all the power which he possessed  over himself  to suppress his emotion      you have been to see lady delacour   said he  calmly   is she much  hurt   it was a terrible accident       she has been much hurt   said dr  x       and she has been for some  hours delirious  but ask me no more questions now  for i am asleep  and  must go to bed  unless you have any thing to say that can waken me  you  look as if some great misfortune had befallen you  what is the matter       oh  my dear friend   said hervey  taking his hand   do not jest with  me  i am not able to bear your raillery in my present temper  in one  word  i fear that belinda is unworthy of my esteem  i can tell you no  more  except that i am more miserable than i thought any woman could  make me       you are in a prodigious hurry to be miserable   said dr  x       upon  my word i think you would make a mighty pretty hero in a novel  you take  things very properly for granted  and  stretched out upon that sofa  you  act the distracted lover vastly well  and to complete the matter  you  cannot tell me why you are more miserable than ever man or hero was  before  i must tell you  then  that you have still more cause for  jealousy than you suspect  ay  start  every jealous man starts at the  sound of the word jealousy  a certain symptom this of the disease       you mistake me   cried clarence hervey   no man is less disposed to  jealousy than i am  but          but your mistress  no  not your mistress  for you have never yet  declared to her your attachment  but the lady you admire will not let a  drunken man unlock a door  and you immediately suppose        she has mentioned the circumstance to you   exclaimed hervey  in a  joyful tone   then she  must  be innocent       admirable reasoning   i was going to have told you just now  if you  would have suffered me to speak connectedly  that you have more reason  for jealousy than you suspect  for miss portman has actually unlocked  for me  for me  look at me  the door  the mysterious door  and whilst i  live  and whilst she lives  we can neither of us ever tell you the cause  of the mystery  all i can tell you is  that no lover is in the case   upon my honour  and now  if you should ever mistake curiosity in your  own mind for jealousy  expect no pity from me       i should deserve none   said clarence hervey   you have made me the  happiest of men       the happiest of men   no  no  keep that superlative exclamation for  a future occasion  but now you behave like a reasonable creature  you  deserve to hear the praises of your belinda  i am so much charmed with  her  that i wish        when can i see her   interrupted hervey   i ll go to her this instant       gently   said dr  x       you forget what time of the day it is  you  forget that miss portman has been up all night  that lady delacour is  extremely ill  and that this would be the most unseasonable opportunity  you could possibly choose for your visit      to this observation clarence hervey assented  but he immediately seized  a pen from the doctor s writing table  and began a letter to belinda   the doctor threw himself upon the sofa  saying   waken me when you want  me   and in a few minutes he was fast asleep      doctor  upon second thoughts   said clarence  rising suddenly  and  tearing his letter down the middle   i cannot write to her yet  i forgot  the reformation of lady delacour  how soon do you think she will be  well  besides  i have another reason for not writing to belinda at  present  you must know  my dear doctor  that i have  or had  another  mistress       another mistress  indeed   cried dr  x      trying to waken himself      good heavens  i do believe you ve been asleep       i do believe i have       but is it possible that you could fall sound asleep in that time       very possible   said the doctor   what is there so extraordinary in  a man s falling asleep  men are apt to sleep sometime within the  four and twenty hours  unless they have half a dozen mistresses to keep  them awake  as you seem to have  my good friend      a servant now came into the room with a letter  that had just arrived  express from the country for dr  x          this is another affair   cried he  rousing himself     the letter required the doctor s immediate attendance  he shook hands  with clarence hervey   my dear friend  i am really concerned that i  cannot stay to hear the history of your six mistresses  but you see that  this is an affair of life and death       farewell   said clarence   i have not six  i have only three goddesses   even if you count lady delacour for one  but i really wanted your advice  in good earnest       if your case be desperate  you can write  cannot you  direct to me at  horton hall  cambridge  in the mean time  as far as general rules go  i  can give you my advice gratis  in the formula of an old scotch song              tis good to be merry and wise        tis good to be honest and true        tis good to be off with the old love      before you be on with the new             chapter xi     difficulties       before he left town  dr  x     called in berkeley square  to see lady  delacour  he found that she was out of all immediate danger  miss  portman was sorry that he was obliged to quit her at this time  but she  felt the necessity for his going  he was sent for to attend mr  horton   an intimate friend of his  a gentleman of great talents  and of the most  active benevolence  who had just been seized with a violent fever  in  consequence of his exertions in saving the poor inhabitants of a village  in his neighbourhood from the effects of a dreadful fire  which broke  out in the middle of the night     lady delacour  who heard dr  x     giving this account to belinda  drew  back her curtain  and said   go this instant  doctor  i am out of all  immediate danger  you say  but if i were not  i must die in the course  of a few months  you know  and what is my life  compared with the chance  of saving your excellent friend  he is of some use in the world  i am of  none  go this instant  doctor       what a pity   said dr  x      as he left the room   that a woman who  is capable of so much magnanimity should have wasted her life on petty  objects       her life is not yet at an end  oh  sir  if you  could  save her   cried  belinda     doctor x     shook his head  but returning to belinda  after going half  way down stairs  he added   when you read this paper  you will know all  that i can tell you upon the subject      belinda  the moment the doctor was gone  shut herself up in her own room  to read the paper which he had given to her  dr  x     first stated that  he was by no means certain that lady delacour really had the complaint  which she so much dreaded  but it was impossible for him to decide  without farther examination  to which her ladyship could not be  prevailed upon to submit  then he mentioned all that he thought would be  most efficacious in mitigating the pain that lady delacour might feel   and all that could be done  with the greatest probability of prolonging  her life  and he concluded with the following words   these are all  temporizing expedients  according to the usual progress of the disease   lady delacour may live a year  or perhaps two      it is possible that her life might be saved by a  skilful  surgeon  by  a few words that dropped from her ladyship last night  i apprehend  that she has some thoughts of submitting to an operation  which will  be attended with much pain and danger  even if she employ the most  experienced surgeon in london  but if she put herself  from a vain hope  of secrecy  into ignorant hands  she will inevitably destroy herself      after reading this paper  belinda had some faint hopes that lady  delacour s life might be saved  but she determined to wait till dr   x    should return to town  before she mentioned his opinion to his  patient  and she earnestly hoped that no idea of putting herself into  ignorant hands would recur to her ladyship     lord delacour  in the morning  when he was sober  retained but a  confused idea of the events of the preceding night  but he made an  awkwardly good natured apology to miss portman for his intrusion  and  for the disturbance he had occasioned  which  he said  must be laid  to the blame of lord studley s admirable burgundy  he expressed much  concern for lady delacour s terrible accident  but he could not help  observing  that if his advice had been taken  the thing could not have  happened  that it was the consequence of her ladyship s self willedness  about the young horses      how she got the horses without paying for them  or how she got money to  pay for them  i know not   said his lordship   for i said i would have  nothing to do with the business  and i have kept to my resolution      his lordship finished his morning visit to miss portman  by observing  that  the house would now be very dull for her  that the office of a  nurse was ill suited to so young and beautiful a lady  but that her  undertaking it with so much cheerfulness was a proof of a degree  of good nature that was not always to be met with in the young and  handsome      the manner in which lord delacour spoke convinced belinda that he was in  reality attached to his wife  however the fear of being  or of appearing  to be  governed by her ladyship might have estranged him from her  and  from home  she now saw in him much more good sense  and symptoms of a  more amiable character  than his lady had described  or than she ever  would allow that he possessed     the reflections  however  which miss portman made upon the miserable  life this ill matched couple led together  did not incline her in favour  of marriage in general  great talents on one side  and good nature  on the other  had  in this instance  tended only to make each party  unhappy  matches of interest  convenience  and vanity  she was  convinced  diminished instead of increasing happiness  of domestic  felicity she had never  except during her childhood  seen examples  she  had  indeed  heard from dr  x     descriptions of the happy family of  lady anne percival  but she feared to indulge the romantic hope of ever  being loved by a man of superior genius and virtue  with a temper and  manners suited to her taste  the only person she had seen  who at all  answered this description  was mr  hervey  and it was firmly fixed in  her mind  that he was not a marrying man  and consequently not a man of  whom any prudent woman would suffer herself to think with partiality   she could not doubt that he liked her society and conversation  his  manner had sometimes expressed more than cold esteem  lady delacour had  assured her that it expressed love  but lady delacour was an imprudent  woman in her own conduct  and not scrupulous as to that of others   belinda was not guided by  her  opinions of propriety  and now that her  ladyship was confined to her bed  and not in a condition to give her  either advice or protection  she felt that it was peculiarly incumbent  on her to guard  not only her conduct from reproach  but her heart from  the hopeless misery of an ill placed attachment  she examined herself  with firm impartiality  she recollected the excessive pain that she had  endured  when she first heard clarence hervey say  that belinda portman  was a compound of art and affectation  but this she thought was only  the pain of offended pride  of proper pride  she recollected the extreme  anxiety she had felt  even within the last four and twenty hours   concerning the opinion which he might form of the transaction about the  key of the boudoir  but this anxiety she justified to herself  it was  due  she thought  to her reputation  it would have been inconsistent  with female delicacy to have been indifferent about the suspicions that  necessarily arose from the circumstances in which she was placed  before  belinda had completed her self examination  clarence hervey called to  inquire after lady delacour  whilst he spoke of her ladyship  and of his  concern for the dreadful accident of which he believed himself to be  in a great measure the cause  his manner and language were animated and  unaffected  but the moment that this subject was exhausted  he became  embarrassed  though he distinctly expressed perfect confidence and  esteem for her  he seemed to wish  and yet to be unable  to support  the character of a friend  contradistinguished to an admirer  he seemed  conscious that he could not  with propriety  advert to the suspicions  and jealousy which he had felt the preceding night  for a man who has  never declared love would be absurd and impertinent  were he to betray  jealousy  clarence was destitute neither of address nor presence of  mind  but an accident happened  when he was just taking leave of miss  portman  which threw him into utter confusion  it surprised  if it  did not confound  belinda  she had forgotten to ask dr  x     for his  direction  and as she thought it might be necessary to write to him  concerning lady delacour s health  she begged of mr  hervey to give it  to her  he took a letter out of his pocket  and wrote the direction with  a pencil  but as he opened the paper  to tear off the outside  on  which he had been writing  a lock of hair dropped out of the letter  he  hastily stooped for it  and as he took it up from the ground the lock  unfolded  belinda  though she cast but one involuntary  hasty glance at  it  was struck with the beauty of its colour  and its uncommon length   the confusion of clarence hervey convinced her that he was extremely  interested about the person to whom the hair belonged  and the  species of alarm which she had felt at this discovery opened her eyes  effectually to the state of her own heart  she was sensible that the  sight of a lock of hair  however long  or however beautiful  in the  hands of any man but clarence hervey  could not possibly have excited  any emotion in her mind   fortunately   thought she   i have discovered  that he is attached to another  whilst it is yet in my power to command  my affections  and he shall see that i am not so weak as to form any  false expectations from what i must now consider as mere common place  flattery   belinda was glad that lady delacour was not present at the  discovery of the lock of hair  as she was aware that she would have  rallied her unmercifully upon the occasion  and she rejoiced that she  had not been prevailed upon to give  madame la comtesse de pomenars   a lock of her  belle chevelure   she could not help thinking  from the  recollection of several minute circumstances  that clarence hervey had  endeavoured to gain an interest in her affections  and she felt that  there would be great impropriety in receiving his ambiguous visits  during lady delacour s confinement to her room  she therefore gave  orders that mr  hervey should not in future be admitted  till her  ladyship should again see company  this precaution proved totally  superfluous  for mr  hervey never called again  during the whole course  of lady delacour s confinement  though his servant regularly came every  morning with inquiries after her ladyship s health  she kept her room  for about ten days  a confinement to which she submitted with extreme  impatience  bodily pain she bore with fortitude  but constraint and  ennui she could not endure     one morning as she was sitting up in bed  looking over a large  collection of notes  and cards of inquiry after her health  she  exclaimed       these people will soon be tired of    bidding their footman put it into  their heads to inquire whether i am alive or dead  i must appear amongst  them again  if it be only for a few minutes  or they will forget me   when i am fatigued  i will retire  and you  my dear belinda  shall  represent me  so tell them to open my doors  and unmuffle the knocker   let me hear the sound of music and dancing  and let the house be filled  again  for heaven s sake  dr  zimmermann should never have been my  physician  for he would have prescribed solitude  now solitude and  silence are worse for me than poppy and mandragora  it is impossible to  tell how much silence tires the ears of those who have not been used  to it  for mercy s sake  marriott   continued her ladyship  turning to  marriott  who just then came softly into the room   for mercy s sake   don t walk to all eternity on tiptoes  to see people gliding about like  ghosts makes me absolutely fancy myself amongst the shades below  i  would rather be stunned by the loudest peal that ever thundering footman  gave at my door  than hear marriott lock that boudoir  as if my life  depended on my not hearing the key turned       dear me  i never knew any lady that was ill  except my lady  complain  of one s not making a noise to disturb her   said marriott      then to please you  marriott  i will complain of the only noise that  does  or ever did disturb me  the screaming of your odious macaw      now marriott had a prodigious affection for this macaw  and she defended  it with as much eagerness as if it had been her child      odious  o dear  my lady  to call my poor macaw odious   i didn t expect  it would ever have come to this  i am sure i don t deserve it  i m sure  i don t deserve that my lady should have taken such a dislike to me      and here marriott actually burst into tears   but  my dear marriott    said lady delacour   i only object to your macaw  may not i dislike your  macaw without disliking you   i have heard of  love me  love my dog    but i never heard of  love me  love my bird   did you  miss portman      marriott turned sharply round upon miss portman  and darted a fiery look  at her through the midst of her tears   then  tis plain   said she    who i m to thank for this   and as she left the room her lady could not  complain of her shutting the door after her too gently      give her three minutes  grace and she will come to her senses   said  lady delacour   for she is not a bankrupt in sense  oh  three minutes  won t do  i must allow her three days  grace  i perceive   said lady  delacour when marriott half an hour afterward reappeared  with a face  which might have sat for the picture of ill humour  her ill humour   however  did not prevent her from attending her lady as usual  she  performed all her customary offices with the most officious zeal but  in profound silence  except every now and then she would utter a sigh   which seemed to say   see how much i m attached to my lady  and yet my  lady hates my macaw   her lady  who perfectly understood the language of  sighs  and felt the force of marriott s  forbore to touch again on the  tender subject of the macaw  hoping that when her house was once more  filled with company  she should be relieved by more agreeable noises  from continually hearing this pertinacious tormentor     as soon as it was known that lady delacour was sufficiently recovered to  receive company  her door was crowded with carriages  and as soon as  it was understood that balls and concerts were to go on as usual at  her house  her  troops of friends  appeared to congratulate her  and to  amuse themselves      how stupid it is   said lady delacour to belinda   to hear  congratulatory speeches from people  who would not care if i were in  the black hole at calcutta this minute  but we must take the world as it  goes  dirt and precious stones mixed together  clarence hervey  however    n a pas une ame de boue   he  i am sure  has been really concerned for  me  he thinks that his young horses were the sole cause of the whole  evil  and he blames himself so sincerely  and so unjustly  that i really  was half tempted to undeceive him  but that would have been doing him  an injury  for you know great philosophers tell us that there is no  pleasure in the world equal to that of being well deceived  especially  by the fair sex  seriously  belinda  is it my fancy  or is not clarence  wonderfully changed  is not he grown pale  and thin  and serious  not to  say melancholy  what have you done to him since i have been ill       nothing  i have never seen him       no  then the thing is accounted for very naturally  he is in despair  because he has been banished from your divine presence       more likely because he has been in anxiety about your ladyship   said  belinda      i will find out the cause  let it be what it may   said lady delacour    luckily my address is equal to my curiosity  and that is saying a great  deal      notwithstanding all her ladyship s address  her curiosity was baffled   she could not discover clarence hervey s secret  and she began to  believe that the change which she had noticed in his looks and manner  was imaginary or accidental  had she seen more of him at this time  she  would not have so easily given up her suspicions  but she saw him only  for a few minutes every day  and during that time he talked to her with  all his former gaiety  besides  lady delacour had herself a daily part  to perform  which occupied almost her whole attention  notwithstanding  the vivacity which she affected  belinda perceived that she was now more  seriously alarmed than she had ever been about her health  it was all  that her utmost exertions could accomplish  to appear for a short time  in the day  some evenings she came into company only for half an hour   on other days only for a few minutes  just walked through the rooms   paid her compliments to every body  complained of a nervous head ache   left belinda to do the honours for her  and retired     miss portman was now really placed in a difficult and dangerous  situation  and she had ample opportunities of learning and practising  prudence  all the fashionable dissipated young men in london frequented  lady delacour s house  and it was said that they were drawn thither by  the attractions of her fair representative  the gentlemen considered a  niece of mrs  stanhope as their lawful prize  the ladies wondered that  the men could think belinda portman a beauty  but whilst they affected  to scorn  they sincerely feared her charms  thus left entirely to her  own discretion  she was exposed at once to the malignant eye of envy   and the insidious voice of flattery  she had no friend  no guide  and  scarcely a protector  her aunt stanhope s letters  indeed  continually  supplied her with advice  but with advice which she could not follow  consistently with her own feelings and principles  lady delacour  even  if she had been well  was not a person on whose counsels she could rely   our heroine was not one of those daring spirits  who are ambitious of  acting for themselves  she felt the utmost diffidence of her own powers   yet at the same time a firm resolution not to be led even by timidity  into follies which the example of lady delacour had taught her to  despise  belinda s prudence seemed to increase with the necessity for  its exertion  it was not the mercenary wily prudence of a young lady   who has been taught to think it virtue to sacrifice the affections of  her heart to the interests of her fortune  it was not the prudence of a  cold and selfish  but of a modest and generous woman  she found it most  difficult to satisfy herself in her conduct towards clarence hervey   he seemed mortified and miserable if she treated him merely as a  common acquaintance  yet she felt the danger of admitting him to the  familiarity of friendship  had she been thoroughly convinced that he was  attached to some other woman  she hoped that she could freely converse  with him  and look upon him as a married man  but notwithstanding the  lock of beautiful hair  she could not entirely divest herself of the  idea that she was beloved  when she observed the extreme eagerness with  which clarence hervey watched all her motions  and followed her with his  eye as if his fate depended upon her  she remarked that he endeavoured  as much as possible to prevent this species of attention from being  noticed  either by the public or by herself  his manner towards her  every day became more distant and respectful  more constrained and  embarrassed  but now and then a different look and expression escaped   she had often heard of mr  hervey s great  address  in affairs of  gallantry  and she was sometimes inclined to believe that he was  trifling with her  merely for the glory of a conquest over her heart  at  other times she suspected him of deeper designs upon her  such as would  deserve contempt and detestation  but upon the whole she was disposed  to believe that he was entangled by some former attachment from which he  could not extricate himself with honour  and upon this supposition she  thought him worthy of her esteem  and of her pity     about this time sir philip baddely began to pay a sort of lounging  attention to belinda  he knew that clarence hervey liked her  and this  was the principal cause of his desire to attract her attention   belinda  portman  became his favourite toast  and amongst his companions he gave  himself the air of talking of her with rapture      rochfort   said he  one day  to his friend   damme  if i was to think  of belinda portman in  any way   you take me  clary would look damned  blue  hey   damned blue  and devilish small  and cursed silly too  hey        pon honour  i should like to see him   said rochfort    pon honour  he  deserves it from us  sir phil  and i ll stand your friend with the girl   and it will do no harm to give her a hint of clary s windsor flame  as a  dead secret   pon honour  he deserves it from us      now it seems that sir philip baddely and mr  rochfort  during the time  of clarence hervey s intimacy with them  observed that he paid frequent  visits at windsor  and they took it into their heads that he kept a  mistress there  they were very curious to see her  and  unknown to  clarence  they made several attempts for this purpose  at last one  evening  when they were certain that he was not at windsor  they scaled  the high garden wall of the house which he frequented  and actually  obtained a sight of a beautiful young girl and an elderly lady  whom  they took for her gouvernante  this adventure they kept a profound  secret from clarence  because they knew that he would have quarrelled  with them immediately  and would have called them to account for their  intrusion  they now determined to avail themselves of their knowledge   and of his ignorance of this circumstance  but they were sensible  that it was necessary to go warily to work  lest they should betray  themselves  accordingly they began by dropping distant mysterious  hints about clarence hervey to lady delacour and miss portman  such  for instance as   damme  we all know clary s a perfect connoisseur in  beauty  hey  rochfort   one beauty at a time is not enough for him  hey   damme  and it is not fashion  nor wit  nor elegance  and all that  that  he looks for  always       these observations were accompanied with the most significant looks   belinda heard and saw all this in painful silence  but lady delacour  often used her address to draw some farther explanation from sir philip   his regular answer was   no  no  your ladyship must excuse me there  i  can t peach  damme  hey  rochfort      he was in hopes  from the reserve with which miss portman began to treat  clarence  that he should  without making any distinct charge  succeed  in disgusting her with his rival  mr  hervey was about this time less  assiduous than formerly in his visits at lady delacour s  sir philip  was there every day  and often for miss portman s entertainment exerted  himself so far as to tell the news of the town  one morning  when  clarence hervey happened to be present  the baronet thought it incumbent  upon him to eclipse his rival in conversation  and he began to talk of  the last fete champetre at frogmore      what a cursed unlucky overturn that was of yours  lady delacour  with  those famous young horses  why  what with this sprain  and this nervous  business  you ve not been able to stir out since the birthday  and  you ve missed the breakfast  and all that  at frogmore  why  all the  world stayed broiling in town on purpose for it  and you that had a card  too  how damned provoking       i regret extremely that my illness prevented me from being at this  charming fete  i regret it more on miss portman s account than on  my own   said her ladyship  belinda assured her that she felt no  mortification from the disappointment      o  damme  but i would have driven you in my curricle   said sir philip    it was the finest sight and best conducted i ever saw  and only wanted  miss portman to make it complete  we had gipsies  and mrs  mills the  actress for the queen of the gipsies  and she gave us a famous good  song  rochfort  you know  and then there  was  two children upon an   ass   damme  i don t know how they came there  for they re things one  sees every day  and belonged only to two of the soldiers  wives  for we  had the whole band of the staffordshire playing at dinner  and we had  some famous glees  and fawcett gave us his laughing song  and then we  had the launching of the ship  and only it was a boat  it would have  been well enough  but damme  the song of polly oliver was worth the  whole  except the flemish hercules  ducrow  you know  dressed in light  blue and silver  and  miss portman  i wish you had seen this  three  great coach wheels on his chin  and a ladder and two chairs and two  children on them  and after that  he sported a musquet and bayonet with  the point of the bayonet on his chin  faith  that was really famous   but i forgot the pyrrhic dance  miss portman  which was damned fine  too   danced in boots and spurs by those hungarian fellows  they  jump and turn about  and clap their knees with their hands  and put  themselves in all sorts of ways  and then we had that song of polly  oliver  as i told you before  and mrs  mills gave us  no  no  it was  a drummer of the staffordshire dressed as a gipsy girl  gave us  the  cottage on the moor   the most charming thing  and would suit your  voice  miss portman  damme  you d sing it like an angel    but where  was i   oh  then they had tea  and fireplaces built of brick  out in  the air  and then the entrance to the ball room was all a colonnade  done with lamps and flowers  and that sort of thing  and there was  some bon mot  but that was in the morning  amongst the gipsies about an  orange and the stadtholder  and then there was a turkish dance  and a  polonese dance  all very fine  but nothing to come up to the  pyrrhic touch  which was a great deal the most knowing  in boots and  spurs  damme  now  i can t describe the thing to you   tis a cursed pity  you weren t there  damme      lady delacour assured sir philip that she had been more entertained by  the description than she could have been by the reality    clarence  was  not it the best description you ever heard  but pray favour us with  a  touch  of the pyrrhic dance  sir philip      lady delacour spoke with such polite earnestness  and the baronet had so  little penetration and so much conceit  that he did not suspect her  of irony  he eagerly began to exhibit the pyrrhic dance  but in such  a manner that it was impossible for human gravity to withstand the  sight  rochfort laughed first  lady delacour followed him  and clarence  hervey and belinda could no longer restrain themselves      damme  now i believe you ve all been quizzing me   cried the baronet   and he fell into a sulky silence  eyeing clarence hervey and miss  portman from time to time with what he meant for a  knowing  look   his silence and sulkiness lasted till clarence took his leave  soon  afterward belinda retired to the music room  sir philip then begged to  speak a few words to lady delacour  with a face of much importance  and  after a preamble of nonsensical expletives  he said that his regard for  her ladyship and miss portman made him wish to explain hints which had  been dropped from him at times  and which he could not explain to her  satisfaction  without a promise of inviolable secresy   as hervey is or  was a sort of a friend  i can t mention this sort of thing without such  a preliminary    lady delacour gave the preliminary promise  and sir  philip informed her  that people began to take notice that hervey was  an admirer of miss portman  and that it might be a disadvantage to the  young lady  as mr  hervey could have no serious intentions  because he  had an attachment  to his certain knowledge  elsewhere      a matrimonial attachment   said lady delacour      why  damme  as to matrimony  i can t say  but the girl s so famously  beautiful  and clary has been constant to her so many years          many years  then she is not young       oh  damme  yes  she is not more than seventeen   and  let her be what  else she will  she s a famous fine girl  i had a sight of her once at  windsor  by stealth      and then the baronet described her after his manner    where clary keeps  her now  i can t make out  but he has taken her away from windsor  she  was then with a gouvernante  and is as proud as the devil  which smells  like matrimony for clary       and do you know this peerless damsel s name       i think the old jezebel called her miss st  pierre  ay  damme  it was  virginia too  virginia st  pierre       virginia st  pierre  a pretty romantic name   said lady delacour    miss portman and i are extremely obliged by your attention to the  preservation of our hearts  and i promise you we shall keep your counsel  and our own      sir philip then  with more than his usual complement of oaths   pronounced miss portman to be the finest girl he had ever seen  and took  his leave     when lady delacour repeated this story to belinda  she concluded by  saying   now  my dear  you know sir philip baddely has his own views  in telling us all this  in telling  you   all this  for evidently he  admires you  and consequently hates clarence  so i believe only half the  man says  and the other half  though it has made you turn so horribly  pale  my love  i consider as a thing of no manner of consequence to  you       of no manner of consequence to me  i assure your ladyship   said  belinda   i have always considered mr  hervey as        oh  as a common acquaintance  no doubt  but we ll pass over all those  pretty speeches  i was going to say that this  mistress in the wood  can  be of no consequence to your happiness  because  whatever that fool sir  philip may think  clarence hervey is not a man to go and marry a  girl who has been his mistress for half a dozen years  do not look so  shocked  my dear  i really cannot help laughing  i congratulate  you  however  that the thing is no worse  it is all in rule and in  course  when a man marries  he sets up new equipages  and casts off  old mistresses  or if you like to see the thing as a woman of sentiment  rather than as a woman of the world  here is the prettiest opportunity  for your lover s making a sacrifice  i am sorry i cannot make you smile   my dear  but consider  as nobody knows this naughty thing but ourselves   we are not called upon to bristle up our morality  and the most moral  ladies in the world do not expect men to be as moral as themselves   so we may suit the measure of our external indignation to our real  feelings  sir philip cannot stir in the business  for he knows clarence  would call him out if his secret visit to virginia were to come to light   i advise you  d aller votre train  with clarence  without seeming to  suspect him in the least  there is nothing like innocence in these  cases  my dear  but i know by the spanish haughtiness of your air  at this instant  that you would sooner die the death of the  sentimental  than follow my advice      belinda  without any haughtiness  but with firm gentleness  replied   that she had no designs whatever upon mr  hervey  and that therefore  there could be no necessity for any manoeuvring on her part   that the  ambiguity of his conduct towards her had determined her long since to  guard her affections  and that she had the satisfaction to feel that  they were entirely under her command      that is a great satisfaction  indeed  my dear   said lady delacour    it is a pity that your countenance  which is usually expressive  enough  should not at this instant obey your wishes and express perfect  felicity  but though you feel no pain from disappointed affection   doubtless the concern that you show arises from the necessity you are  under of withdrawing a portion of your esteem from mr  hervey  this  is the style for you  is it not  after all  my dear  the whole maybe  a quizzification of sir philip s  and yet he gave me such a minute  description of her person  i am sure the man has not invention or taste  enough to produce such a fancy piece       did he mention   said belinda  in a low voice   the colour of her  hair       yes  light brown  but the colour of this hair seems to affect you more  than all the rest      here  to belinda s great relief  the conversation was interrupted by the  entrance of marriott  from all she had heard  but especially from the  agreement between the colour of the hair which dropped from hervey s  letter with sir philip s description of virginia s  miss portman was  convinced that clarence had some secret attachment  and she could not  help blaming him in her own mind for having  as she thought  endeavoured  to gain her affections  whilst he knew that his heart was engaged to  another  mr  hervey  however  gave her no farther reason to suspect him  of any design to win her love  for about this time his manner towards  her changed   he obviously endeavoured to avoid her  his visits were  short  and his attention was principally directed to lady delacour  when  she retired  he took his leave  and sir philip baddely had the field to  himself  the baronet  who thought that he had succeeded in producing a  coldness between belinda and his rival  was surprised to find that he  could not gain any advantage for himself  for some time he had not the  slightest thoughts of any serious connexion with the lady  but at last  he was piqued by her indifference  and by the raillery of his friend  rochfort       pon honour   said rochfort   the girl must be in love with clary  for  she minds you no more than if you were nobody       i could make her sing to another tune  if i pleased   said sir philip    but  damme  it would cost me too much  a wife s too expensive a thing   now a days  why  a man could have twenty curricles  and a fine stud  and  a pack of hounds  and as many mistresses as he chooses into the bargain   for what it would cost him to take a wife  oh  damme  belinda portman s  a fine girl  but not worth so much as that comes to  and yet  confound  me  if i should not like to see how blue clary would look  if i were to  propose for her in good earnest  hey  rochfort   i should like to pay  him for the way he served us about that quiz of a doctor  hey       ay   said rochfort   you know he told us there was a  tant pis  and a   tant mieux  in every thing  he s not come to the  tant pis  yet   pon  honour  sir philip  the thing rests with you      the baronet vibrated for some time between the fear of being taken in by  one of mrs  stanhope s nieces  and the hope of triumphing over clarence  hervey  at last  what he called love prevailed over prudence  and he was  resolved  cost him what it would  to have belinda portman  he had not  the least doubt of being accepted  if he made a proposal of marriage   consequently  the moment that he came to this determination  he could  not help assuming  d avance  the tone of a favoured lover      damme   cried sir philip  one night  at lady delacour s concert    i think that mr  hervey has taken out a patent for talking to miss  portman  but damme if i give up this place  now i have got it   cried  the baronet  seating himself beside belinda     mr  hervey did not contest his seat  and sir philip kept his post during  the remainder of the concert  but  though he had the field entirely to  himself  he could not think of any thing more interesting  more amusing   to whisper in belinda s ear  than   don t you think the candles want  snuffing famously            chapter xii     the macaw       the baronet determined the next day upon the grand attack  he waited  upon miss portman with the certainty of being favourably received  but  he was  nevertheless  somewhat embarrassed to know how to begin the  conversation  when he found himself alone with the lady     he twirled and twisted a short stick that he held in his hand  and  put it into and out of his boot twenty times  and at last he began  with   lady delacour s not gone to harrowgate yet       no  her ladyship has not yet felt herself well enough to undertake the  journey       that was a cursed unlucky overturn  she may thank clarence hervey for  that  it s like him   he thinks he s a better judge of horses  and wine   and every thing else  than any body in the world  damme  now if i don t  believe he thinks nobody else but himself has eyes enough to see that a  fine woman s a fine woman  but i d have him to know  that miss belinda  portman has been sir philip baddely s toast these two months      as this intelligence did not seem to make the expected impression upon  miss belinda portman  sir philip had recourse again to his little stick   with which he went through the sword exercise  after a silence of some  minutes  and after walking to the window  and back again  as if to look  for sense  he exclaimed   how is mrs  stanhope now  pray  miss portman   and your sister  mrs  tollemache  she was the finest woman  i thought   the first winter she came out  that ever i saw  damme  have you ever  been told that you re like her       never  sir       oh  damn it then  but you are  only ten times handsomer       ten times handsomer than the finest woman you ever saw  sir philip    said belinda  smiling      than the finest woman i had ever seen  then    said sir philip   for   damme  i did not know what it was to be in love  then    here the  baronet heaved an audible sigh    i always laughed at love  and all  that   then   and marriage particularly  i ll trouble you for mrs   stanhope s direction  miss portman  i believe  to do the thing in style   i ought to write to her before i speak to you      belinda looked at him with astonishment  and laying down the pencil  with which she had just begun to write a direction to mrs  stanhope   she said   perhaps  sir philip  to  do the thing in style   i ought to  pretend at this instant not to understand you  but such false delicacy  might mislead you  permit me  therefore  to say  that if i have  any concern in the letter which you  are going to write to my aunt  stanhope          well guessed   interrupted sir philip   to be sure you have  and you re  a charming girl  damn me if you aren t  for meeting my ideas in this  way  which will save a cursed deal of trouble   added the polite lover   seating himself on the sofa  beside belinda      to prevent your giving yourself any further trouble then  sir  on my  account   said miss portman         nay  damme  don t catch at that unlucky word  trouble  nor look so  cursed angry  though it becomes you  too  uncommonly  and i like pride  in a handsome woman  if it was only for variety s sake  for it s not  what one meets with often  now a days  as to trouble  all i meant was   the trouble of writing to mrs  stanhope  which of course i thank you for  saving me  for to be sure  i d rather  and you can t blame me for that   have my answer from your own charming lips  if it was only for the  pleasure of seeing you blush in this heavenly sort of style       to put an end to this heavenly sort of style  sir   said belinda   withdrawing her hand  which the baronet took as if he was confident of  its being his willing prize   i must explicitly assure you  that it is  not in my power to encourage your addresses  i am fully sensible   added  miss portman   of the honour sir philip baddely has done me  and i hope  he will not be offended by the frankness of my answer       you can t be in earnest  miss portman   exclaimed the astonished  baronet      perfectly in earnest  sir philip       confusion seize me   cried he  starting up   if this isn t the most  extraordinary thing i ever heard  will you do me the honour  madam  to  let me know your particular objections to sir philip baddely       my objections   said belinda   cannot be obviated  and therefore it  would be useless to state them       nay  pray  ma am  do me the favour  i only ask for information sake  is  it to sir philip baddely s fortune        l  a year  you object  or  to his family  or to his person   oh  curse it   said he  changing his  tone   you re only quizzing me to see how i should look  damn me  you  did it too well  you little coquet      belinda again assured him that she was entirely in earnest  and that she  was incapable of the sort of coquetry which he ascribed to her      oh  damme  ma am  then i ve no more to say  a coquet is a thing i  understand as well as another  and if we had been only talking in the  air  it would have been another thing  but when i come at once to a  proposal in form  and a woman seriously tells me she has objections that  cannot be obviated  damme  what must i  or what must the world conclude   but that she s very unaccountable  or that she s engaged  which last i  presume to be the case  and it would have been a satisfaction to me to  have known it sooner  at any rate  it is a satisfaction to me to know it  now       i am sorry to deprive you of so much satisfaction   said miss portman    by assuring you  that i am not engaged to any one      here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of lord delacour   who came to inquire of miss portman how his lady did  the baronet  after  twisting his little black stick into all manner of shapes  finished by  breaking it  and then having no other resource  suddenly wished miss  portman a good morning  and decamped with a look of silly ill humour  he  was determined to write to mrs  stanhope  whose influence over her niece  he had no doubt would be decisive in his favour   sir philip seems to  be a little out of sorts this morning   said lord delacour   i am afraid  he s angry with me for interrupting his conversation  but really i did  not know he was here  and i wanted to catch you a moment alone  that  i might  in the first place  thank you for all your goodness to lady  delacour  she has had a tedious sprain of it  these nervous fevers  and convulsions  i don t understand them  but i think dr  x     s  prescriptions seem to have done her good  for she is certainly better of  late  and i am glad to hear music and people again in the house   because i know all this is what my lady delacour likes  and there is  no reasonable indulgence that i would not willingly allow a wife  but i  think there is a medium in all things  i am not a man to be governed  by a wife  and when i have once said a thing  i like to be steady and  always shall  and i am sure miss portman has too much good sense to  think me wrong  for now  miss portman  in that quarrel about the coach  and horses  which you heard part of one morning at breakfast  i must  tell you the beginning of that quarrel       excuse me  my lord  but i would rather hear of the end than of the  beginning of quarrels       that shows your good sense as well as your good nature  i wish you  could make my lady delacour of your taste  she does not want sense  but  then  i speak to you freely of all that lies upon my mind  miss portman   for i know  i  know  you have no delight in making mischief in a house    between you and me  her sense is not of the right kind  a woman may  have too much wit  now too much is as bad as too little  and in a woman   worse  and when two people come to quarrel  then wit on either side   but more especially on the wife s  you know is very provoking   tis like  concealed weapons  which are wisely forbidden by law  if a person kill  another in a fray  with a concealed weapon  ma am  by a sword in a cane   for instance   tis murder by the law  now even if it were not contrary  to law  i would never have such a thing in my cane to carry about with  me  for when a man s in a passion he forgets every thing  and would as  soon lay about him with a sword as with a cane  so it is better such  a thing should not be in his power  and it is the same with wit  which  would be safest and best out of the power of some people       but is it fair  my lord  to make use of wit yourself to abuse wit in  others   said belinda with a smile  which put his lordship into perfect  good humour with both himself and his lady      why  really   said he   there would be no living with lady delacour  if  i did not come out with a little sly bit of wit now and then  but it is  what i am not in the habit of doing  i assure you  except when very  hard pushed  but  miss portman  as you like so much to hear the end of  quarrels  here s the end of one which you have a particular right to  hear something of   continued his lordship  taking out his pocket book  and producing some bank notes   you should have received this before   madam  if i had known of the transaction sooner  of your part of it  i  mean       milord  de man call to speak about de burgundy you order  milord   said  champfort  who came into the room with a sly  inquisitive face      tell him i ll see him immediately  show him into the parlour  and give  him a newspaper to read       yes  milord  milord has it in his pocket since he dress       here it is   said his lordship  and as champfort came forward to  receive the newspaper  his eye glanced at the bank notes  and then at  miss portman      here   continued lord delacour  as champfort had left the room   here  are your two hundred guineas  miss portman  and as i am going to this  man about my burgundy  and shall be out all the rest of the day  let  me trouble you the next time you see lady delacour to give her this  pocket book from me  i should be sorry that miss portman  from any thing  that has passed  should run away with the idea that i am a niggardly  husband  or a tyrant  though i certainly like to be master in my own  house  what are you doing  madam   that is your note  that does not go  into the pocket book  you know       permit me to put it in  my lord   said belinda  returning the  pocket book to him   and to beg you will give lady delacour the pleasure  of seeing you  she has inquired several times whether your lordship were  at home  i will run up to her dressing room  and tell her that you are  here       how lightly she goes on the wings of good nature   said lord delacour    i can do no less than follow her  for though i like to be treated with  respect in my own house  there is a time for every thing  i would  not give lady delacour the trouble of coming down here to me with her  sprained ankle  especially as she has inquired for me several times      his lordship s visit was not of unseasonable length  for he recollected  that the man who came about the burgundy was waiting for him  but   perhaps  the shortness of the visit rendered it the more pleasing  for  lady delacour afterward said to belinda   my dear  would you believe  it  my lord delacour was absolutely a perfect example of the useful  and agreeable this morning  who knows but he may become the sublime and  beautiful in time   en attendant  here are your two hundred guineas   my dear belinda  a thousand thanks for the thing  and a million for the  manner  manner is all in all in conferring favours  my lord  who  to do  him justice  has too much honesty to pretend to more delicacy than he  really possesses  told me that he had been taking a lesson from miss  portman this morning in the art of obliging  and really  for a grown  gentleman  and for the first lesson  he comes on surprisingly  i do  think  that by the time he is a widower his lordship will be quite  another thing  quite an agreeable man  not a genius  not a clarence  hervey  that you cannot expect  apropos  what is the reason that we have  seen so little of clarence hervey lately  he has certainly some secret  attraction elsewhere  it cannot be that girl sir philip mentioned  no   she s nothing new  can it be at lady anne percival s   or where can it  be  whenever he sees me  i think he asks when we go to harrowgate  now  oakly park is within a few miles of harrowgate  i will not go there   that s decided  lady anne is an exemplary matron  so she is out of the  case  but i hope she has no  sister excellence   no niece  no cousin  to  entangle our hero       ours   said belinda      well   yours   then   said lady delacour      mine       yes  yours  i never in my life saw a better struggle between a sigh  and a smile  but what have you done to poor sir philip baddely  my lord  delacour told me  you know all people who have nothing else to say   tell news quicker than others  my lord delacour told me  that he saw sir  philip part from you this morning in a terrible bad humour  come  whilst  you tell your story  help me to string these pearls  that will save you  from the necessity of looking at me  and will conceal your blushes  you  need not be afraid of betraying sir philip s secrets  for i could have  told you long ago  that he would inevitably propose for you  the fact  is nothing new or surprising to me  but i should really like to hear how  ridiculous the man made himself       and that   said belinda   is the only thing which i do not wish to tell  your ladyship       lord  my dear  surely it is no secret that sir philip baddely is  ridiculous  but you are so good natured that i can t be out of humour  with you  if you won t gratify my curiosity  will you gratify my taste   and sing for me once more that charming song which none but you  can   sing to please me   i must learn it from you  absolutely      just as belinda was beginning to sing  marriott s macaw began to scream   so that lady delacour could not hear any thing else      oh  that odious macaw   cried her ladyship   i can endure it no longer    and she rang her bell violently    it kept me from sleeping all last  night  marriott must give up this bird  marriott  i cannot endure that  macaw  you must part with it for my sake  marriott  it cost you four  guineas  i am sure i would give five with the greatest pleasure to get  rid of it  for it is the torment of my life       dear  my lady  i can assure you it is only because they will not shut  the doors after them below  as i desire  i am certain mr  champfort  never shut a door after him in his life  nor never will if he was to  live to the days of methuselah       that is very little satisfaction to me  marriott   said lady delacour      and indeed  my lady  it is very little satisfaction to me  to hear my  macaw abused as it is every day of my life  for mr  champfort s fault       but it cannot be champfort s fault that i have ears       but if the doors were shut  my lady  you wouldn t or couldn t hear  as  i ll prove immediately   said marriott  and she ran directly and shut   according to her own account   eleven doors which were stark staring  wide open     now  my lady  you can t hear a single syllable of the  macaw       no  but one of the eleven doors will open presently   said lady  delacour   you will observe it is always more than ten to one against  me      a door opened  and the macaw was heard to scream   the macaw must go   marriott  that is certain   said her ladyship  firmly      then  i  must go  my lady   said marriott  angrily   that is certain   for to part with my macaw is a thing i cannot do to please  any  body    her eyes turned with indignation upon belinda  from association merely   because the last time that she had been angry about her macaw  she had  also been angry with miss portman  whom she imagined to be the secret  enemy of her favourite      to stay another week in the house after my macaw s discarded in  disgrace is a thing nothing shall prevail upon me to do   she flung out  of the room in a fury      good heavens  am i reduced to this   said lady delacour   she thinks  that she has me in her power  no  i can die without her  i have but a  short time to live  i will not live a slave  let the woman betray me   if she will  follow her this moment  my dear generous friend  tell  her never to come into this room again  take this pocket book  pay  her whatever is due to her in the first place  and give her fifty  guineas  observe   not as a bribe  but as a reward      it was a delicate and difficult commission  belinda found marriott at  first incapable of listening to reason   i am sure there is nobody in  the world that would treat me and my macaw in this manner  except my  lady   cried she   and somebody must have set her against me  for it is  not natural to her  but since she can t bear me about her any longer    tis time i should be gone       the only thing of which lady delacour complained was the noise of this  macaw   said belinda   it was a pretty bird  how long have you had it       scarcely a month   said marriott  sobbing      and how long have you lived with your lady       six years   and to part with her after all         and for the sake of a macaw  and at a time when your lady is so much in  want of you  marriott  you know she cannot live long  and she has much  to suffer before she dies  and if you leave her  and if in a fit of  passion you betray the confidence she has placed in you  you will  reproach yourself for it ever afterward  this bird  or all the birds  in the world  will not be able to console you  for you are of an  affectionate disposition  i know  and sincerely attached to your poor  lady       that i am   and to betray her   oh  miss portman  i would sooner cut  off my hand than do it  and i have been tried more than my lady knows  of  or you either  for mr  champfort  who is the greatest mischief maker  in the world  and is the cause  by not shutting the door  of all this  dilemma  for now  ma am  i m convinced  by the tenderness of your  speaking  that you are not the enemy to me i supposed  and i beg your  pardon  but i was going to say that mr  champfort  who saw the  fracas   between my lord and me  about the key and the door  the night of my  lady s accident  has whispered it about at lady singleton s and every  where  mrs  luttridge s maid  ma am  who is my cousin  has pestered me  with so many questions and offers  from mrs  luttridge and mrs  freke   of any money  if i would only tell who was in the boudoir  and i have  always answered  nobody  and i defy them to get any thing out of me   betray my lady  i d sooner cut my tongue out this minute  can she have  such a base opinion of me  or can you  ma am       no  indeed  i am convinced that you are incapable of betraying her   marriott  but in all probability after you have left her          if my lady would let me keep my macaw   interrupted marriott   i should  never think of leaving her       the macaw she will not suffer to remain in the house  nor is it  reasonable that she should  it deprives her of sleep  it kept her awake  three hours this morning      marriott was beginning the history of champfort and the doors again  but  miss portman stopped her by saying   all this is past now  how much is  due to you  mrs  marriott  lady delacour has commissioned me to pay you  every thing that is due to you       due to me  lord bless me  ma am  am i to go       certainly  it was your own desire  it is consequently your lady s  she  is perfectly sensible of your attachment to her  and of your services   but she cannot suffer herself to be treated with disrespect  here are  fifty guineas  which she gives you as a reward for your past fidelity   not as a bribe to secure your future secresy  you are at liberty  she  desires me to say  to tell her secret to the whole world  if you choose  to do so       oh  miss portman  take my macaw  do what you will with it  only make my  peace with my lady   cried marriott  clasping her hands  in an agony of  grief   here are the fifty guineas  ma am  don t leave them with me  i  will never be disrespectful again  take my macaw and all  no  i will  carry it myself to my lady      lady delacour was surprised by the sudden entrance of marriott  and her  macaw  the chain which held the bird marriott put into her ladyship s  hand without being able to say any thing more than   do what you please   my lady  with it  and with me      pacified by this submission  lady delacour granted marriott s pardon   and she most sincerely rejoiced at this reconciliation     the next day belinda asked the dowager lady boucher  who was going to a  bird fancier s  to take her with her  in hopes that she might be able to  meet with some bird more musical than a macaw  to console marriott for  the loss of her screaming favourite  lady delacour commissioned miss  portman to go to any price she pleased   if i were able  i would  accompany you myself  my dear  for poor marriott s sake  though i would  almost as soon go to the augean stable      there was a bird fancier in high holborn  who had bought several of the  hundred and eighty beautiful birds  which  as the newspapers of the  day advertised  had been  collected  after great labour and expense   by mons  marten and co  for the republican museum at paris  and lately  landed out of the french brig urselle  taken on her voyage from cayenne  to brest  by his majesty s ship unicorn      when lady boucher and belinda arrived at this bird fancier s  they were  long in doubt to which of the feathered beauties they should give  the preference  whilst the dowager was descanting upon their various  perfections  a lady and three children came in  she immediately  attracted belinda s attention  by her likeness to clarence hervey s  description of lady anne percival  it was lady anne  as lady boucher   who was slightly acquainted with her  informed belinda in a whisper     the children were soon eagerly engaged looking at the birds      miss portman   said lady boucher   as lady delacour is so far from  well  and wishes to have a bird that will not make any noise in the  house  suppose you were to buy for mrs  marriott this beautiful pair of  green parroquets  or  stay  a goldfinch is not very noisy  and here is  one that can play a thousand pretty tricks  pray  sir  make it draw up  water in its little bucket for us       oh  mamma   said one of the little boys   this is the very thing that  is mentioned in bewick s history of birds  pray look at this goldfinch   helena  now it is drawing up its little bucket  but where is helena   here s room for you  helena      whilst the little boys were looking at the goldfinch  belinda felt  somebody touch her gently  it was helena delacour      can i speak a few words to you   said helena     belinda walked to the farthest end of the shop with her      is my mamma better   said she  in a timid tone   i have some gold fish   which you know cannot make the least noise  may i send them to her  i  heard that lady call you miss portman  i believe you are the lady who  wrote such a kind postscript to me in mamma s last letter  that is the  reason i speak so freely to you now  perhaps you would write to tell me  if mamma will see me  and lady anne percival would take me at any time   i am sure  but she goes to oakly park in a few days  i wish i might  be with mamma whilst she is ill  i would not make the least noise  but  don t ask her  if you think it will be troublesome  only let me send the  gold fish      belinda was touched by the manner in which this affectionate little girl  spoke to her  she assured her that she would say all she wished to  her mother  and she begged helena to send the gold fish whenever she  pleased      then   said helena   i will send them as soon as i go  home  as soon  as i go back to lady anne percival s  i mean   belinda  when she had  finished speaking to helena  heard the man who was showing the birds   lament that he had not a blue macaw  which lady anne percival was  commissioned to procure for mrs  margaret delacour      red macaws  my lady  i have in abundance  but unfortunately  a blue  macaw i really have not at present  nor have i been able to get one   though i have inquired amongst all the bird fanciers in town  and i went  to the auction at haydon square on purpose  but could not get one      belinda requested lady boucher would tell her servants to bring in the  cage that contained marriott s blue macaw  and as soon as it was brought  she gave it to helena  and begged that she would carry it to her aunt  delacour      lord  my dear miss portman   said lady boucher  drawing her aside   i  am afraid you will get yourself into a scrape  for lady delacour is not  upon speaking terms with this mrs  margaret delacour  she cannot endure  her  you know she is my lord delacour s aunt      belinda persisted in sending the macaw  for she was in hopes that  these terrible family quarrels might be made up  if either party would  condescend to show any disposition to oblige the other     lady anne percival understood miss portman s civility as it was meant      this is a bird of good omen   said she   it augurs family peace       i wish you would do me the favour  lady boucher  to introduce me to  miss portman   continued lady anne      the very thing i wished   cried helena     a few minutes  conversation passed afterward upon different subjects   and lady anne percival and belinda parted with a mutual desire to see  more of each other           chapter xiii     sortes virgilianae       when belinda got home  lady delacour was busy in the library looking  over a collection of french plays with the  ci devant  count de n       a gentleman who possessed such singular talents for reading dramatic  compositions  that many people declared that they would rather hear him  read a play than see it performed at the theatre  even those who were  not judges of his merit  and who had little taste for literature   crowded to hear him  because it was the fashion  lady delacour engaged  him for a reading party at her house  and he was consulting with her  what play would be most amusing to his audience   my dear belinda  i am  glad you are come to give us your opinion   said her ladyship   no one  has a better taste  but first i should ask you what you have done at  your bird fancier s  i hope you have brought home some  horned cock       or some  monstrously  beautiful creature for marriott  if it has not a  voice like the macaw i shall be satisfied  but even if it be the bird  of paradise  i question whether marriott will like it as well as its  screaming predecessor       i am sure she will like what is coming for her   said belinda   and  so will your ladyship  but do not let me interrupt you and monsieur le  comte   and as she spoke  she took up a volume of plays which lay upon  the table      nanine  or la prude  which shall we have   said lady delacour   or what  do you think of l ecossaise       the scene of l ecossaise is laid in london   said belinda   i should  think with an english audience it would therefore be popular       yes  so it will   said lady delacour   then let it be l ecossaise  m   le comte i am sure will do justice to the character of  friport  the  englishman   qui scait donner  mais qui ne scait pas vivre   my dear  i  forgot to tell you that clarence hervey has been here  it is a pity you  did not come a little sooner  you would have heard a charming scene of  the school for scandal read by him  m  le comte was quite delighted  but  clarence was in a great hurry  he would only give us one scene  he was  going to mr  percival s on business  i am sure what i told you the other  day is true  but  however  he has promised to come back to dine with  me  m  le comte  you will dine with us  i hope      the count was extremely sorry that it was impossible  he was engaged   belinda suddenly recollected that it was time to dress for dinner  but  just as the count took his leave  and as she was going up stairs  a  footman met her  and told her that mr  hervey was in the drawing room   and wished to speak to her  many conjectures were formed in belinda s  mind as she passed on to the drawing room  but the moment that she  opened the door  she knew the nature of mr  hervey s business  for she  saw the glass globe containing helena delacour s gold fishes standing on  the table beside him   i have been commissioned to present these to  you for lady delacour   said mr  hervey   and i have seldom received  a commission that has given me so much pleasure  i perceive that miss  portman is indeed a real friend to lady delacour  how happy she is to  have such a friend      after a pause mr  hervey went on speaking of lady delacour  and of his  earnest desire to see her as happy in domestic life as she  appeared   to be in public  he frankly confessed  that when he was first acquainted  with her ladyship  he had looked upon her merely as a dissipated woman  of fashion  and he had considered only his own amusement in cultivating  her society   but   continued he   of late i have formed a different  opinion of her character  and i think  from what i have observed  that  miss portman s ideas on this subject agree with mine  i had laid a plan  for making her ladyship acquainted with lady anne percival  who  appears to me one of the most amiable and one of the happiest of women   oakly park is but a few miles from harrowgate   but i am disappointed in  this scheme  lady delacour has changed her mind  she says  and will not  go there  lady anne  however  has just told me  that  though it is july   and though she loves the country  she will most willingly stay in town  a month longer  as she thinks that  with your assistance  there is some  probability of her effecting a reconciliation between lady delacour  and her husband s relations  with some of whom lady anne is intimately  acquainted  to begin with my friend  mrs  margaret delacour  the macaw  was most graciously received  and i flatter myself that i have prepared  mrs  delacour to think somewhat more favourably of her niece than she  was wont to do  all now depends upon lady delacour s conduct towards  her daughter  if she continues to treat her with neglect  i shall be  convinced that i have been mistaken in her character      belinda was much pleased by the openness and the unaffected good nature  with which clarence hervey spoke  and she certainly was not sorry  to hear from his own lips a distinct explanation of his views and  sentiments  she assured him that no effort that she could make with  propriety should be wanting to effect the desirable reconciliation  between her ladyship and her family  as she perfectly agreed with him in  thinking that lady delacour s character had been generally misunderstood  by the world      yes   said mr  hervey   her connexion with that mrs  freke hurt her  more in the eyes of the world than she was aware of  it is tacitly  understood by the public  that every lady goes bail for the character  of her female friends  if lady delacour had been so fortunate as to meet  with such a friend as miss portman in her early life  what a different  woman she would have been  she once said some such thing to me herself   and she never appeared to me so amiable as at that moment      mr  hervey pronounced these last words in a manner more than usually  animated  and whilst he spoke  belinda stooped to gather a sprig from a  myrtle  which stood on the hearth  she perceived that the myrtle  which  was planted in a large china vase  was propped up on one side with the  broken bits of sir philip baddely s little stick  she took them up  and  threw them out of the window   lady delacour stuck those fragments there  this morning   said clarence smiling   as trophies  she told me of miss  portman s victory over the heart of sir philip baddely  and miss portman  should certainly have allowed them to remain there  as indisputable  evidence in favour of the baronet s taste and judgment      clarence hervey appeared under some embarrassment  and seemed to be  restrained by some secret cause from laying open his real feelings   his manner varied continually  belinda could not avoid seeing his  perplexity  she had recourse again to the gold fishes and to helena   upon these subjects they could both speak very fluently  lady delacour  made her appearance by the time that clarence had finished repeating  the abbe nollet s experiments  which he had heard from his friend doctor  x          now  miss portman  the transmission of sound in water   said  clarence         deep in philosophy  i protest   said lady delacour  as she came in    what is this about the transmission of sound in water   ha  whence come  these pretty gold fishes       these gold fishes   said belinda   are come to console marriott for the  loss of her macaw       thank you  my dear belinda  for these mute comforters   said her  ladyship   the very best things you could have chosen       i have not the merit of the choice   said belinda   but i am heartily  glad that you approve of it       pretty creatures   said lady delacour   no fish were ever so pretty  since the days of the prince of the black islands in the arabian tales   and am i obliged to you  clarence  for these subjects       no  i have only had the honour of bringing them to your ladyship  from          from whom   amongst all my numerous acquaintance  have i one in the  world who cares a gold fish about me   stay  don t tell me  let  me guess    lady newland   no  you shake your heads  i guessed her  ladyship  merely because i know she wants to bribe me some way or other  to go to one of her stupid entertainments  she wants to pick out of  me taste enough to spend a fortune  but you say it was not lady  newland   mrs  hunt then perhaps  for she has two daughters whom she  wants me to ask to my concerts  it was not mrs  hunt   well  then  it  was mrs  masterson  for she has a mind to go with me to harrowgate   where  by the bye  i shall not go  so i won t cheat her out of her gold  fishes  it was mrs  masterson  hey       no  but these little gold fishes came from a person who would be very  glad to go with you to harrowgate   said clarence hervey   or who would  be very glad to stay with you in town   said belinda   from a person who  wants nothing from you but  your love       male or female   said lady delacour      female       female  i have not a female friend in the world but yourself  my dear  belinda  nor do i know another female in the world  whose love i should  think about for half an instant  but pray tell me the name of this  unknown friend of mine  who wants nothing from me but love       excuse me   said belinda   i cannot tell her name  unless you will  promise to see her       you have really made me impatient to see her   said lady delacour   but  i am not able to go out  you know  yet  and with a new acquaintance  one  must go through the ceremony of a morning visit  now   en conscience    is it worth while       very well worth while   cried belinda and clarence hervey  eagerly      ah  pardi  as m  le comte exclaims continually  ah  pardi  you are both  wonderfully interested in this business  it is some sister  niece   or cousin of lady anne percival s  or  no  belinda looks as if i were  wrong  then  perhaps  it is lady anne herself   well  take me where you  please  my dear belinda  and introduce me where you please  i depend on  your taste and judgment in all things  but i really am not yet able to  pay morning visits       the ceremony of a morning visit is quite unnecessary here   said  belinda   i will introduce the unknown friend to you to morrow  if you  will let me invite her to your reading party       with pleasure  she is some charming emigree of clarence hervey s  acquaintance  but where did you meet with her this morning  you have  both of you conspired to puzzle me  take it upon yourselves  then  if  this new acquaintance should not  as ninon de l enclos used to say    quit cost   if she be half as agreeable and  graceful   clarence  as  madame la comtesse de pomenars  i should not think her acquaintance too  dearly purchased by a dozen morning visits      here the conversation was interrupted by a thundering knock at the door      whose carriage is it   said lady delacour   oh  lady newland s  ostentatious livery  and here is her ladyship getting out of her  carriage as awkwardly as if she had never been in one before   overdressed  like a true city dame  pray  clarence  look at her   entangled in her bale of gold muslin  and conscious of her bulse of  diamonds    worth  if i m worth a farthing  five hundred thousand pounds  bank currency   she says or seems to say  whenever she comes into a  room  now let us see her entree        but  my dear   cried lady delacour  starting at the sight of belinda   who was still in her morning dress   absolutely below par   make your  escape to marriott  i conjure you  by all your fears of the contempt  of a lady  who will at the first look estimate you   au juste   to a  farthing a yard      as she left the room  belinda heard clarence hervey repeat to lady  delacour           give me a look  give me a face       that makes simplicity a grace       robes loosely flowing  hair as free       he paused  but belinda recollected the remainder of the stanza           such sweet neglect more taketh me      than all th adulteries of art       that strike mine eyes  but not mine heart      it was observed  that miss portman dressed herself this day with the  most perfect simplicity     lady delacour s curiosity was raised by the description which belinda  and clarence hervey had given of the new acquaintance who sent her the  gold fishes  and who wanted nothing from her but her love     miss portman told her that the  unknown  would probably come half an  hour earlier to the reading party than any of the rest of the company   her ladyship was alone in the library  when lady anne percival brought  helena  in consequence of a note from belinda     miss portman ran down stairs to the hall to receive her  the little girl  took her hand in silence   your mother was much pleased with the pretty  gold fishes   said belinda   and she will be still more pleased  when  she knows that they came from you   she does not know  that  yet       i hope she is better to day  i will not make the least noise    whispered helena  as she went up stairs on tiptoe      you need not be afraid to make a noise  you need not walk on tiptoe   nor shut the doors softly  for lady delacour seems to like all noises  except the screaming of the macaw  this way  my dear       oh  i forgot  it is so long since   is mamma up and dressed       yes  she has had concerts and balls since her illness  you will hear a  play read to night   said belinda   by that french gentleman whom lady  anne percival mentioned to me yesterday       but there is a great deal of company  then  with mamma       nobody is with her now  so come into the library with me   said  belinda   lady delacour  here is the young lady who sent you the gold  fishes       helena   cried lady delacour      you must  i am sure  acknowledge that mr  hervey was in the right  when  he said that the lady was a striking resemblance of your ladyship       mr  hervey knows how to flatter  i never had that ingenuous  countenance  even in my best days  but certainly the hair of her head  is like mine  and her hands and arms  but why do you tremble  helena  is  there any thing so very terrible in the looks of your mother       no  only            only what  my dear       only  i was afraid  you might not like me       who has filled your little foolish head with these vain fears  come   simpleton  kiss me  and tell me how comes it that you are not at  oakly hall  or  what s the name of the place   oakly park       lady anne percival would not take me out of town  she said  whilst you  were ill  because she thought that you might wish  i mean she thought  that i should like to see you  if you pleased       lady anne is very good  very obliging  very considerate       she is  very  good natured   said helena      you love this lady anne percival  i perceive       oh  yes  that i do  she has been so kind to me  i love her as if she  were          as if she  were   what  finish your sentence       my mother   said helena  in a low voice  and she blushed      you love her as well as if she were your mother   repeated lady  delacour   that is intelligible  speak intelligibly whatever you say   and never leave a sentence unfinished       no  ma am       nothing can be more ill bred  nor more absurd  for it shows that you  have the wish without the power to conceal your sentiments  pray  my  dear   continued lady delacour   go to oakly park immediately  all  farther ceremony towards me may be spared       ceremony  mamma   said the little girl  and the tears came into her  eyes  belinda sighed  and for some moments there was a dead silence      i mean only to say  miss portman   resumed lady delacour   that i hate  ceremony  but i know that there are people in the world who love it  who  think all virtue  and all affection  depend on ceremony  who are         content to dwell in  decencies  for ever      i shall not dispute their merits  verily  they have their reward in the  good opinion and good word of all little minds  that is to say  of above  half the world  i envy them not their hard earned fame  let ceremony  curtsy to ceremony with chinese decorum  but  when ceremony expects to  be paid with affection  i beg to be excused       ceremony sets no value upon affection  and therefore would not desire  to be paid with it   said belinda      never yet   continued lady delacour  pursuing the train of her own  thoughts without attending to belinda   never yet was any thing like  real affection won by any of these ceremonious people       never   said miss portman  looking at helena  who  having quickness  enough to perceive that her mother aimed this  tirade  against ceremony  at lady anne percival  sat in the most painful embarrassment  her eyes  cast down  and her face and neck colouring all over   never yet   said  miss portman   did mere ceremonious person win any thing like real  affection  especially from children  who are often excellent  because  unprejudiced  judges of character       we are all apt to think  that an opinion that differs from our own is a  prejudice   said lady delacour   what is to decide       facts  i should think   said belinda      but it is so difficult to get at facts  even about the merest trifles    said lady delacour   actions we see  but their causes we seldom see  an  aphorism worthy of confucius himself  now to apply  pray  my dear  helena  how came you by the pretty gold fishes that you were so good as  to send to me yesterday       lady anne percival gave them to me  ma am       and how came her ladyship to give them to you  ma am       she gave them to me   said helena  hesitating      you need not blush  nor repeat to me that she gave them to you  that i  have heard already  that is the fact  now for the cause  unless it be a  secret  if it be a secret which you have been desired to keep  you  are quite right to keep it  i make no doubt of its being necessary   according to some systems of education  that children should be taught  to keep secrets  and i am convinced  for lady anne percival is  i have  heard  a perfect judge of propriety  that it is peculiarly proper that a  daughter should know how to keep secrets from her mother  therefore   my dear  you need not trouble yourself to blush or hesitate any more  i  shall ask no farther questions  i was not aware that there was any  secret in the case       there is no secret in the world in the case  mamma   said helena   i  only hesitated because        you hesitated  only  because  i suppose you mean  i presume lady anne  percival will have no objection to your speaking good english       i hesitated only because i was afraid it would not be right to praise  myself  lady anne percival one day asked us all        us all       i mean charles  and edward  and me  to give her an account of some  experiments  on the hearing of fishes  which dr  x     had told to us   she promised to give the gold fishes  of which we were all very fond  to  whichever of us should give the best account of them  lady anne gave the  fishes to me       and is this all the secret  so it was real modesty made her hesitate   belinda  i beg your pardon  my dear  and lady anne s  you see how candid  i am  belinda  but one question more  helena  who put it into your head  to send me your gold fishes       nobody  mamma  no one put it into my head  but i was at the  bird fancier s yesterday  when miss portman was trying to get some bird  for mrs  marriott  that could not make any noise to disturb you  so  i thought my fishes would be the nicest things for you in the world   because they cannot make the least noise  and they are as pretty as any  birds in the world  prettier  i think  and i hope mrs  marriott thinks  so too       i don t know what marriott thinks about the matter  but i can tell you  what i think   said lady delacour   that you are one of the sweetest  little girls in the world  and that you would make me love you if i  had a heart of stone  which i have not  whatever some people may  think   kiss me  my child      the little girl sprang forwards  and threw her arms round her mother   exclaiming   oh  mamma  are you in earnest   and she pressed close to  her mother s bosom  clasping her with all her force     lady delacour screamed  and pushed her daughter away      she is not angry with you  my love   said belinda   she is in sudden  and violent pain  don t be alarmed  she will be better soon  no  don t  ring the bell  but try whether you can open these window shutters  and  throw up the sash      whilst belinda was supporting lady delacour  and whilst helena was  trying to open the window  a servant came into the room to announce the  count de n          show him into the drawing room   said belinda  lady delacour  though in  great pain  rose and retired to her dressing room   i shall not be able  to go down to these people yet   said she   you must make my excuses  to the count and to every body  and tell poor helena i was not angry   though i pushed her away  keep her below stairs  i will come as soon as  i am able  send marriott  do not forget  my dear  to tell helena i was  not angry      the reading party went on  and lady delacour made her appearance as the  company were drinking orgeat  between the fourth and fifth act   helena    my dear    said she   will you bring me a glass of orgeat      clarence hervey looked at belinda with a congratulatory smile   do not  you think   whispered he   that we shall succeed  did you see that look  of lady delacour s      nothing tends more to increase the esteem and affection of two people  for each other than their having one and the same benevolent object   clarence hervey and belinda seemed to know one another s thoughts and  feelings this evening better than they had ever done before during the  whole course of their acquaintance     after the play was over  most of the company went away  only a select  party of  beaux esprits  stayed to supper  they were standing at the  table at which the count had been reading  several volumes of french  plays and novels were lying there  and clarence hervey  taking up one of  them  cried   come  let us try our fate by the sortes virgilianae      lady delacour opened the book  which was a volume of marmontel s tales      la femme comme il y en a peu   exclaimed hervey      who will ever more have faith in the sortes virgilianae   said lady  delacour  laughing  but whilst she laughed she went closer to a candle   to read the page which she had opened  belinda and clarence hervey  followed her   really  it is somewhat singular  belinda  that i should  have opened upon this passage   continued she  in a low voice  pointing  it out to miss portman     it was a description of the manner in which la femme comme il y en a  peu managed a husband  who was excessively afraid of being thought to  be governed by his wife  as her ladyship turned over the page  she saw  a leaf of myrtle which belinda  who had been reading the story the  preceding day  had put into the book for a mark      whose mark is this  yours  belinda  i am sure  by its elegance   said  lady delacour   so  this is a concerted plan between you two  i see    continued her ladyship  with an air of pique   you have contrived  prettily de me dire des verites  one says   let us try our fate by the  sortes virgilianae   the other has dexterously put a mark in the book   to make it open upon a lesson for the naughty child      belinda and mr  hervey assured her that they had used no such mean arts   that nothing had been concerted between them      how came this leaf of myrtle here  then   said lady delacour      i was reading that story yesterday  and left it as my mark       i cannot help believing you  because you never yet deceived me  even  in the merest trifle  you are truth itself  belinda  well  you see that   you  were the cause of my drawing such an extraordinary lot  the book  would not have opened here but for your mark  my fate  i find  is in  your hands  if lady delacour is ever to be la femme comme il y en a peu   which is the most  improbable  thing in the world  miss portman will be  the cause of it       which is the most probable thing in the world   said clarence hervey    this myrtle has a delightful perfume   added he  rubbing the leaf  between his fingers      but  after all   said lady delacour  throwing aside the book   this  heroine of marmontel s is not la femme comme il y en a peu  but la femme  comme il n y en a  point        mrs  margaret delacour s carriage  my lady  for miss delacour   said a  footman to her ladyship      helena stays with me to night  my compliments   said lady delacour      how pleased the little gipsy looks   added she  turning to helena  who  heard the message   and how handsome she looks when she is pleased   do  these auburn locks of yours  helena  curl naturally or artificially       naturally  mamma       naturally  so much the better  so did mine at your age      some of the company now took notice of the astonishing resemblance  between helena and her mother  and the more lady delacour considered her  daughter as a part of herself  the more she was inclined to be pleased  with her  the glass globe containing the gold fishes was put in the  middle of the table at supper  and clarence hervey never paid her  ladyship such respectful attention in his life as he did this evening     the conversation at supper turned upon a magnificent and elegant  entertainment which had lately been given by a fashionable duchess   and some of the company spoke in high terms of the beauty and  accomplishments of her grace s daughter  who had for the first time  appeared in public on that occasion      the daughter will eclipse  totally eclipse  the mother   said lady  delacour   that total eclipse has been foretold by many knowing people    said clarence hervey   but how can there be an eclipse between two  bodies which never cross one another and that i understand to be the  case between the duchess and her daughter      this observation seemed to make a great impression upon lady delacour   clarence hervey went on  and with much eloquence expressed his  admiration of the mother who had stopped short in the career of  dissipation to employ her inimitable talents in the education of  her children  who had absolutely brought virtue into fashion by the  irresistible powers of wit and beauty      really  clarence   said lady delacour  rising from table   vous parlez  avec beaucoup d onction  i advise you to write a sentimental comedy   a comedie larmoyante  or a drama on the german model  and call it the  school for mothers  and beg her grace of      to sit for your heroine       your ladyship  surely  would not be so cruel as to send a faithful  servant a begging for a heroine   said clarence hervey     lady delacour smiled at first at the compliment  but a few minutes  afterwards she sighed bitterly   it is too late for me to think of being  a heroine   said she      too late   cried hervey  following her eagerly as she walked out of  the supper room   too late  her grace of      is  some  years older than  your ladyship       well  i did not mean to say  too late    said lady delacour   but let  us go on to something else  why were you not at the fete champetre the  other day  and where were you all this morning  and pray can you tell me  when your friend doctor x     returns to town       mr  horton is getting better   said clarence   and i hope that we shall  have dr  x     soon amongst us again  i hear that he is to be in town in  the course of a few days       did he inquire for me   did he ask how i did       no  i fancy he took it for granted that your ladyship was quite well   for i told him you were getting better every day  and that you were in  charming spirits       yes   said lady delacour   but i wear myself out with these charming  spirits  i am very nervous still  i assure you  and sitting up late is  not good for me  so i shall wish you and all the world a good night  you  see i am absolutely a reformed rake            chapter xiv     the exhibition       two hours after her ladyship had retired to her room  as belinda was  passing by the door to go to her own bedchamber  she heard lady delacour  call to her      belinda  you need not walk so softly  i am not asleep  come in  will  you  my dear  i have something of consequence to say to you  is all the  world gone       yes  and i thought that you were asleep  i hope you are not in pain       not just at present  thank you  but that was a terrible embrace of  poor little helena s  you see to what accidents i should be continually  exposed  if i had that child always about me  and yet she seems of such  an affectionate disposition  that i wish it were possible to keep her at  home  sit down by my bedside  my dear belinda  and i will tell you what  i have resolved upon      belinda sat down  and lady delacour was silent for some minutes      i am resolved   said she   to make one desperate effort for my life   new plans  new hopes of happiness  have opened to my imagination  and   with my hopes of being happy  my courage rises  i am determined to  submit to the dreadful operation which alone can radically cure me  you  understand me  but it must be kept a profound secret  i know of a person  who could be got to perform this operation with the utmost secrecy       but  surely   said belinda   safety must be your first object       no  secrecy is my first object  nay  do not reason with me  it is a  subject on which i cannot  will not  reason  hear me  i will keep helena  with me for a few days  she was surprised by what passed in the library  this evening  i must remove all suspicion from her mind       there is no suspicion in her mind   said belinda      so much the better  she shall go immediately to school  or to  oakly park  i will then stand my trial for life or death  and if i live  i will be  what i have never yet been  a mother to helena  if i die  you  and clarence hervey will take care of her  i know you will  that young  man is worthy of you  belinda  if i die  i charge you to tell him that  i knew his value  that i had a soul capable of being touched by the  eloquence of virtue   lady delacour  after a pause  said  in an altered  tone   do you think  belinda  that i shall survive this operation       the opinion of dr  x       said belinda   must certainly be more  satisfactory than mine   and she repeated what the doctor had left with  her in writing upon this subject   you see   said belinda   that dr   x    is by no means certain that you have the complaint which you  dread       i am certain of it   said lady delacour  with a deep sigh  then  after  a pause  she resumed   so it is the doctor s opinion  that i shall  inevitably destroy myself if  from a vain hope of secrecy  i put myself  into ignorant hands  these are his own words  are they  very strong  and  he is prudent to leave that opinion in writing  now  whatever happens   he cannot be answerable for  measures which he does not guide   nor you  either  my dear  you have done all that is prudent and proper  but i  must beg you to recollect  that i am neither a child nor a fool  that i  am come to years of discretion  and that i am not now in the delirium  of a fever  consequently  there can be no pretence for  managing  me  in  this particular i must insist upon managing myself  i have confidence  in the skill of the person whom i shall employ  dr  x      very likely   would have none  because the man may not have a diploma for killing  or curing in form  that is nothing to the purpose  it is i that am to  undergo the operation  it is  my  health   my  life  that is risked  and  if i am satisfied  that is enough  secrecy  as i told you before  is my  first object       and cannot you   said belinda   depend with more security upon the  honour of a surgeon who is at the head of his profession  and who has a  high reputation at stake  than upon a vague promise of secrecy from some  obscure quack  who has no reputation to lose       no   said lady delacour   i tell you  my dear  that i cannot depend  upon any of these  honourable men   i have taken means to satisfy myself  on this point  their honour and foolish delicacy would not allow them  to perform such an operation for a wife  without the knowledge  privity   consent   c   c   c  of her husband  now lord delacour s knowing the  thing is quite out of the question       why  my dear lady delacour  why   said belinda  with great earnestness    surely a husband has the strongest claim to be consulted upon such an  occasion  let me entreat you to tell lord delacour your intention  and  then all will be right  say yes  my dear friend  let me prevail upon  you   said belinda  taking her ladyship s hand  and pressing it between  both of hers with the most affectionate eagerness     lady delacour made no answer  but fixed her eyes upon belinda s      lord delacour   continued miss portman   deserves this from you  by the  great interest  the increasing interest  that he has shown of late  about your health  his kindness and handsome conduct the other morning  certainly pleased you  and you have now an opportunity of showing that  confidence in him  which his affection and constant attachment to you  merit       i trouble myself very little about the constancy of lord delacour s  attachment to me   said her ladyship coolly  withdrawing her hand from  belinda   whether his lordship s affection for me has of late increased  or diminished  is an object of perfect indifference to me  but if i were  inclined to reward him for his late attentions  i should apprehend that  we might hit upon some better reward than you have pitched upon   unless you imagine that lord delacour has a peculiar taste for surgical  operations  i cannot conceive how his becoming my confidant upon this  occasion could have an immediate tendency to increase his affection for  me  about which affection i don t care a straw  as you  better than any  one else  must know  for i am no hypocrite  i have laid open my whole  heart to you  belinda       for that very reason   said miss portman   i am eager to use the  influence which i know i have in your heart for your happiness  i am  convinced that it will be absolutely impossible that you should carry on  this scheme in the house with your husband without its being discovered   if he discover it by accident  he will feel very differently from what  he would do if he were trusted by you       for heaven s sake  my dear   cried lady delacour   let me hear no more  about lord delacour s feelings       but allow me then to speak of my own   said belinda   i cannot be  concerned in this affair  if it is to be concealed from your husband       you will do about that as you think proper   said lady delacour  haughtily   your sense of propriety towards lord delacour is  i observe   stronger than your sense of honour towards me  but i make no doubt that  you act upon principle  just principle  you promised never to  abandon me  but when i most want your assistance  you refuse it  from  consideration for lord delacour  a scruple of delicacy absolves a person  of nice feelings  i find  from a positive promise  a new and convenient  code of morality      belinda  though much hurt by the sarcastic tone in which her ladyship  spoke  mildly answered  that the promise she had made to stay with her  ladyship during her illness was very different from an engagement to  assist her in such a scheme as she had now in contemplation     lady delacour suddenly drew the curtain between her and belinda  saying    well  my dear  at all events  i am glad to hear you don t forget your  promise of  staying  with me  you are  perhaps  prudent to refuse me  your assistance  all circumstances considered  good night  i have kept  you up too long  good night       good night   said belinda  drawing aside the curtain   you will not be  displeased with me  when you reflect coolly       the light blinds me   said lady delacour  and she turned her face away  from miss portman  and added  in a drowsy voice   i will  think of what  has been said  some time or other  but just now i would rather go  to sleep than say or hear any more  for i am more than half asleep  already      belinda closed the curtains and left the room  but lady delacour   notwithstanding the drowsy tone in which she pronounced these last  words  was not in the least inclined to sleep  a passion had taken  possession of her mind  which kept her broad awake the remainder of the  night  the passion of jealousy  the extreme eagerness with which belinda  had urged her to consult lord delacour  and to trust him with her  secret  displeased her  not merely as an opposition to her will  and  undue attention to his lordship s feelings  but as  confirmation strong   of a hint which had been dropped by sir philip baddely  but which never  till now had appeared to her worthy of a moment s consideration  sir  philip had observed  that   if a young lady had any hopes of being a  viscountess  it was no wonder she thought a baronet beneath her notice     now   thought lady delacour   this is not impossible  in the first  place  belinda portman is niece to mrs  stanhope  she may have all her  aunt s art  and the still greater art to conceal it under the mask of  openness and simplicity   volto sciolto  pensieri stretti   is the grand  maxim of the stanhope school   the moment lady delacour s mind turned  to suspicion  her ingenuity rapidly supplied her with circumstances and  arguments to confirm and justify her doubts      miss portman fears that my husband is growing too fond of me  she says   he has been very attentive to me of late  yes  so he has  and on purpose  to disgust him with me  she immediately urges me to tell him that i have  a loathsome disease  and that i am about to undergo a horrid operation   how my eyes have been blinded by her artifice  this last stroke was  rather too bold  and has opened them effectually  and now i see a  thousand things that escaped me before  even to night  the sortes  virgilianae  the myrtle leaf  miss portman s mark  left in the book  exactly at the place where marmontel gives a receipt for managing a  husband of lord delacour s character  ah  ah  by her own confession  she  had been reading this  studying it  yes  and she has studied it to some  purpose  she has made that poor weak lord of mine think her an angel   how he ran on in her praise the other day  when he honoured me with a  morning visit  that morning visit  too  was of her suggestion  and  the bank notes  as he  like a simpleton  let out in the course of the  conversation  had been offered to her first  she  with a delicacy that  charmed my short sighted folly  begged that they might go through my  hands  how artfully managed  mrs  stanhope herself could not have done  better  so  she can make lord delacour do whatever she pleases  and  she condescends to make him behave  prettily  to me  and desires him  to bring me peace offerings of bank notes  she is  in fact  become my  banker  mistress of my house  my husband  and myself  ten days i have  been confined to my room  truly  she has made a good use of her time   and i  fool that i am  have been thanking her for all her disinterested  kindness      then her attention to my daughter  disinterested  too  as i  thought   but  good heavens  what an idiot i have been  she looks  forward to be the step mother of helena  she would win the simple  child s affections even before my face  and show lord delacour what a  charming wife and mother she would make  he said some such thing to me   as well as i remember  the other day  then her extreme prudence  she  never coquets  not she  with any of the young men who come here on  purpose to see her  is this natural  absolutely unnatural  artifice   artifice  to contrast herself with me in lord delacour s opinion is  certainly her object  even to clarence hervey  with whom she was  or  pretended to be  smitten  how cold and reserved she is grown of late   and how haughtily she rejected my advice  when i hinted that she was  not taking the way to win him  i could not comprehend her  she had no  designs on clarence hervey  she assured me  immaculate purity  i believe  you      then her refusal of sir philip baddely   a baronet with fifteen  thousand a year to be refused by a girl who has nothing  and merely  because he is a fool  how could i be such a fool as to believe it   worthy niece of mrs  stanhope  i know you now  and now i recollect that  extraordinary letter of mrs  stanhope s which i snatched out of miss  portman s hands some months ago  full of blanks  and inuendoes  and  references to some letter which belinda had written about my disputes  with my husband  from that moment to this  miss portman has never let me  see another of her aunt s letters  so i may conclude they are all in the  same style  and i make no doubt that she has instructed her niece   all this time  how to proceed  now i know why she always puts mrs   stanhope s letters into her pocket the moment she receives them  and  never opens them in my presence  and i have been laying open my whole  heart  telling my whole history  confessing all my faults and follies   to this girl  and i have told her that i am dying  i have taught her  to look forward with joy and certainty to the coronet  on which she has  fixed her heart      on my knees i conjured her to stay with me to receive my last breath   oh  dupe  miserable dupe  that i am  could nothing warn me  in the  moment that i discovered the treachery of one friend  i went and  prostrated myself to the artifices of another  of another a thousand  times more dangerous  ten thousand times more beloved  for what was  harriot freke in comparison with belinda portman  harriot freke  even  whilst she diverted me most  i half despised  but belinda   oh  belinda   how entirely have i loved  trusted  admired  adored  respected  revered  you      exhausted by the emotions to which she had worked herself up by the  force of her powerful imagination  lady delacour  after passing several  restless hours in bed  fell asleep late in the morning  and when she  awaked  belinda was standing by her bedside   what could you be dreaming  of   said belinda  smiling   you started  and looked at me with such  horror  when you opened your eyes  as if i had been your evil genius    it is not in human nature  thought lady delacour  suddenly overcome by  the sweet smile and friendly tone of belinda  it is not in human nature  to be so treacherous  and she stretched out both her arms to belinda   saying   you my evil genius  no  my guardian angel  my dearest belinda   kiss me  and forgive me       forgive you for what   said belinda   i believe you are dreaming still   and i am sorry to awaken you  but i am come to tell you a wonderful  thing  that lord delacour is up  and dressed  and actually in the  breakfast room  and that he has been talking to me this half hour  of  what do you think   of helena  he was quite surprised  he said  to see  her grown such a fine girl  and he declares that he no longer regrets  that she was not a boy  and he says that he will dine at home to day  on  purpose to drink helena s health in his new burgundy  and  in short  i  never saw him in such good spirits  or so agreeable  i always thought he  was one of the best natured men i had ever seen  will not you get up to  breakfast  lord delacour has asked for you ten times within these five  minutes       indeed   said lady delacour  rubbing her eyes   all this is vastly  wonderful  but i wish you had not awakened me so soon       nay  nay   said belinda   i know by the tone of your voice  that you  do not mean what you say  i know you will get up  and come down to us  directly  so i will send marriott      lady delacour got up  and went down to breakfast  in much uncertainty  what to think of miss portman  but ashamed to let her into her mind  and  still more afraid that lord delacour should suspect her of doing him the  honour to be jealous  belinda had not the least guess of what was really  passing in her ladyship s heart  she implicitly believed her expressions  of complete indifference to her lord  and jealousy was the last feeling  which miss portman would have attributed to lady delacour  because she  unfortunately was not sufficiently aware that jealousy can exist without  love  the idea of lord delacour as an object of attachment  or of a  coronet as an object of ambition  or of her friend s death as an object  of joy  were so foreign to belinda s innocent mind  that it was scarcely  possible she could decipher lady delacour s thoughts  her ladyship  affected to be in  remarkable good spirits this morning   declared that  she had never felt so well since her illness  ordered her carriage  as soon as breakfast was over  and said she would take helena to  maillardet s  to see the wonders of his little conjuror and his  singing bird   nothing equal to maillardet s singing bird has ever been  seen or heard of  my dear helena  since the days of aboulcasem s peacock  in the persian tales  since lady anne percival has not shown you these  charming things  i must       but i hope you won t tire yourself  mamma   said the little girl      i m afraid you will   said belinda   and you know  my dear   added lord  delacour   that miss portman  who is so very obliging and good natured    could  go just as well with helena  and i am sure   would   rather than  that you should tire yourself  or give yourself an unnecessary trouble       miss portman is very good   answered lady delacour  hastily   but i  think it no unnecessary trouble to give my daughter any pleasure in my  power  as to its tiring me  i am neither dead  nor dying   yet   for the  rest  miss portman  who understands what is proper  blushes for you  as  you see  my lord  when you propose that she  who is not  yet  a married  woman  should  chaperon  a young lady  it is quite out of rule  and mrs   stanhope would be shocked if her niece could  or would  do such a thing  to oblige any body      lord delacour was too much in the habit of hearing sarcastic  and to him  incomprehensible speeches from her ladyship  to take any extraordinary  notice of this  and if belinda blushed  it was merely from the confusion  into which she was thrown by the piercing glance of lady delacour s  black eyes  a glance which neither guilt nor innocence could withstand   belinda imagined that her ladyship still retained some displeasure from  the conversation that had passed the preceding night  and the first  time that she was alone with lady delacour  she again touched upon the  subject  in hopes of softening or convincing her   at all events   my dear friend   said she   you will not  i hope  be offended by the  sincerity with which i speak  i  can  have no object but your safety and  happiness       sincerity never offends me   was her ladyship s cold answer  and all  the time that they were out together  she was unusually ceremonious  to miss portman  and there would have been but little conversation   if helena had not been present  to whom her mother talked with fluent  gaiety  when they got to spring gardens  helena exclaimed   oh  there s  lady anne percival s carriage  and charles and edward with her  they are  going to the same place that we are  i dare say  for i heard charles  ask lady anne to take him to see maillardet s little bird  mr  hervey  mentioned it to us  and he said it was a curious piece of machinery       i wish you had told me sooner that lady anne was likely to be there  i  don t wish to meet her so awkwardly  i am not well enough yet  indeed   to go to these odious  hot  close places  and  besides  i hate seeing  sights      helena  with much good humour  said that she would rather give up  seeing the sight than be troublesome to her mother  when they came to  maillardet s  however  lady delacour saw mrs       getting out of her  carriage  and to her she consigned helena and miss portman  saying that  she would take a turn or two in the park  and call for them in half  an hour  when the half hour was over  and her ladyship returned  she  carelessly asked  as they were going home  whether they had been pleased  with their visit to the bird and the conjuror   oh  yes  mamma   said  helena   and do you know  that one of the questions that the people  ask the conjuror is   where is the happiest family to be found    and  charles and edward immediately said   if he is a good conjuror  if he  tells truth  he ll answer   at oakly park        miss portman  had you any conversation with lady anne percival   said  lady delacour  coldly      a great deal   said belinda   and such as i am sure you would have  liked  and so far from being a ceremonious person  i think i never saw  any body who had such easy engaging manners       and did she ask you  helena  again to go with her to that place where  the happiest family in the world is to be found       oakly park   no  mamma  she said that she was very glad that i was with  you  but she asked miss portman to come to see her whenever it was in  her power       and could miss portman withstand such a temptation       you know that i am engaged to your ladyship   said belinda     lady delacour bowed   but from what passed last night   said she   i was  afraid that you might repent your engagement to me  and if so  i give up  my bond  i should be miserable if i apprehended that any one  but more  especially miss portman  felt herself a prisoner in my house       dear lady delacour  i do not feel myself a prisoner  i have always till  now felt myself a friend in your house  but we ll talk of this another  time  do not look at me with so much coldness  do not speak to me with  so much politeness  i will not let you forget that i am your friend       i do not wish to forget it  belinda   said lady delacour  with emotion    i am not ungrateful  though i may seem capricious  bear with me       there now  you look like yourself again  and i am satisfied   cried  belinda   as to going to oakly park  i give you my word i have not the  most distant thoughts of it  i stay with you from choice  and not from  compulsion  believe me       i  do  believe you   said lady delacour  and for a moment she was  convinced that belinda stayed with her for her own sake alone  but the  next minute she suspected that lord delacour was the secret cause of her  refusing to go to oakly park  his lordship dined at home this day  and  two or three succeeding days  and he was not intoxicated from  monday till thursday  these circumstances appeared to his lady very  extraordinary  in fact  he was pleased and amused with his little  daughter  helena  and whilst she was yet almost a stranger to him  he  wished to appear to her in the most agreeable and respectable light  possible  one day after dinner  lord delacour  who was in a remarkably  good humour  said to her ladyship   my dear  you know that your new  carriage was broken almost to pieces the night when you were overturned   well  i have had it all set to rights again  and new painted  and it is  all complete  except the hammer cloth  which must have new fringe  what  colour will you have the fringe       what do you say  miss portman   said her ladyship      black and orange would look well  i think   said belinda   and would  suit the lace of your liveries  would not it       certainly  black and orange then   said lord delacour   it shall be       if you ask my opinion   said lady delacour   i am for blue and white   to match the cloth of the liveries       blue and white then it shall be   said lord delacour      nay  miss portman has a better taste than i have  and she says black  and orange  my lord       then you ll have it black and orange  will you   said lord delacour      just as you please   said lady delacour  and no more passed     soon afterward a note came from lady anne percival  with some trifles  belonging to helena  for which her mother had sent  the note was for  belinda  another pressing invitation to oakly park  and a very civil  message from mrs  margaret delacour  and thanks to lady delacour for  the macaw  ay  thought lady delacour  miss portman wants to ingratiate  herself in time with all my husband s relations   mrs  margaret delacour  should have addressed these thanks to you  miss portman  for i had not  the grace to think of sending her the macaw   lord delacour  who was  very fond of his aunt  immediately joined his thanks  and observed that  miss portman was always considerate  always obliging  always kind   then he drank her health in a bumper of burgundy  and insisted upon his  little helena s drinking her health   i am sure you ought  my dear  for  miss portman is very good  too good to you  child       very good  not too good  i hope   said lady delacour   miss portman   your health       and i hope   continued his lordship  after swallowing his bumper   that  my lady anne percival does not mean to inveigle you away from us  miss  portman  you don t think of leaving us  miss portman  i hope  here s  helena would break her little heart   i say nothing for my lady  delacour  because she can say every thing so much better for herself   and i say nothing for myself  because i am the worst man in the world  at making speeches  when i really have a thing at heart  as i have your  staying with us  miss portman      belinda assured him that there was no occasion to press her to do what  was perfectly agreeable to her  and said that she had no thoughts of  leaving lady delacour  her ladyship  with some embarrassment  expressed  herself  extremely obliged  and gratified  and happy   helena  with  artless joy  threw her arms about belinda  and exclaimed   i am glad  you are not going  for i never liked any body so much  of whom i knew so  little       the more you know of miss portman the more you will like her  child  at  least i have found it so   said lord delacour      clarence hervey would  i am sure  have given the pigot diamond  if it  were in his gift  for such a smile as you bestowed on lord delacour just  now   whispered lady delacour  for an instant belinda was struck with  the tone of pique and reproach  in which  her ladyship spoke   nay   my dear  i did not mean to make you blush so piteously   pursued her  ladyship   i really did not think it a blushing matter  but you know  best  believe me  i spoke without malice  we are so apt to judge from  our own feelings  and i could as soon blush about the old man of the  mountains as about my lord delacour       lord delacour   said belinda  with a look of such unfeigned surprise   that her ladyship instantly changed countenance  and  taking her hand  with gaiety  said   so  my little belinda  i have caught you  the blush  belongs then to clarence hervey  well  any man of common sense would  rather have one blush than a thousand smiles for his share  now we  understand one another  and will you go with me to the exhibition  to morrow  i am told there are some charming pictures this year  helena   who really has a genius for drawing  should see these things  and whilst  she  is  with me  i will make her as happy as possible  you see the  reformation is beginning  clarence hervey and miss portman can do  wonders  if it be my fate  at last  to be  la bonne mere   or  la femme  comme il y en a peu   how can i help it  there is no struggling against  fate  my dear      whenever lady delacour s suspicions of belinda were suspended  all her  affections returned with double force  she wondered at her own folly   she was ashamed that she could have let such ideas enter her mind   and she was beyond measure astonished that any thing relative to lord  delacour could so far have interested her attention   luckily   said she  to herself   he has not the penetration of a blind beetle  and  besides   he has little snug jealousies of his own  so he will never find me  out  it would be an excellent thing indeed  if he were to turn my    master torment   against myself  it would be a judgment upon me  the  manes of poor lawless would then be appeased  but it is impossible i  should ever be a jealous wife  i am only a jealous friend  and i  must satisfy myself about belinda  to be a second time a dupe to  the treachery of a friend would be too much for me  too much for my  pride  too much for my heart      the next day  when they came to the exhibition  lady delacour had an  opportunity of judging of belinda s real feelings  as they went up the  stairs  they heard the voices of sir philip baddely and mr  rochfort   who were standing upon the landing place  leaning over the banisters   and running their little sticks along the iron rails  to try which could  make the loudest noise      have you been much pleased with the pictures  gentlemen   said lady  delacour  as she passed them      oh  damme  no   tis a cursed bore  and yet there are some fine  pictures  one in particular  hey  rochfort   one damned fine picture    said sir philip  and the two gentlemen laughing significantly  followed  lady delacour and belinda into the rooms      ay  there s one picture that s worth all the rest   pon honour    repeated rochfort   and we ll leave it to your ladyship s and miss  portman s taste and judgment to find it out  mayn t we  sir philip       oh  damme  yes   said sir philip   by all means   but he was so  impatient to direct her eyes  that he could not keep himself still an  instant      oh  curse it  rochfort  we d better tell the ladies at once  else they  may be all day looking and looking       nay  sir philip  may not i be allowed to guess  must i be told which is  your fine picture   this is not much in favour of my taste       oh  damn it  your ladyship has the best taste in the world  every body  knows  and so has miss portman  and this picture will hit her taste  particularly  i m sure  it is clarence hervey s fancy  but this is a  dead secret  dead  clary no more thinks that we know it  than the man in  the moon       clarence hervey s fancy  then i make no doubt of its being good for  something   said lady delacour   if the painter have done justice to his  imagination  for clarence has really a fine imagination       oh  damme   tis not amongst the history pieces   cried sir philip     tis a portrait       and a history piece  too   pon honour   said rochfort   a family  history piece  i take it   pon honour  it will turn out   said rochfort   and both the gentlemen were  or affected to be  thrown into convulsions  of laughter  as they repeated the words   family history piece   pon  honour   family history piece  damme       i ll take my oath as to the portrait s being a devilish good likeness    added sir philip  and as he spoke  he turned to miss portman   miss  portman has it  damme  miss portman has him      belinda hastily withdrew her eyes from the picture at which she was  looking   a most beautiful creature   exclaimed lady delacour      oh  faith  yes  i always do clary the justice to say  he has a damned  good taste for beauty       but this seems to be foreign beauty   continued lady delacour   if one  may judge by her air  her dress  and the scenery about her  cocoa trees   plantains  miss portman  what think you       i think   said belinda   but her voice faltered so much that she could  hardly speak    that it is a scene from paul and virginia  i think the  figure is st  pierre s virginia       virginia st  pierre  ma am   cried mr  rochfort  winking at sir philip    no  no  damme  there you are wrong  rochfort  say hervey s virginia   and then you have it  damme  or  may be  virginia hervey  who knows       this is a portrait   whispered the baronet to lady delacour   of  clarence s mistress   whilst her ladyship leant her ear to this whisper   which was sufficiently audible  she fixed a seemingly careless  but most  observing  inquisitive eye upon poor belinda  her confusion  for she  heard the whisper  was excessive      she loves clarence hervey  she has no thoughts of lord delacour and  his coronet  i have done her injustice   thought lady delacour  and  instantly she despatched sir philip out of the room  for a catalogue  of the pictures  begged mr  rochfort to get her something else  and   drawing miss portman s arm within hers  she said  in a low voice   lean  upon me  my dearest belinda  depend upon it  clarence will never be such  a fool as to marry the girl  virginia hervey she will never be       and what will become of her  can mr  hervey desert her  she looks  like innocence itself  and so young  too  can he leave her for ever to  sorrow  and vice  and infamy   thought belinda  as she kept her eyes  fixed  in silent anguish  upon the picture of virginia   no  he cannot  do this  if he could he would be unworthy of me  and i  ought  to think  of him no more  no  he will marry her  and i  must  think of him no  more      she turned abruptly away from the picture  and she saw clarence hervey  standing beside her      what do you think of this picture  is it not beautiful  we are quite  enchanted with it  but you do not seem to be struck with it  as we were  at the first glance   said lady delacour      because   answered clarence  gaily   it is not the first glance i have  had at that picture  i admired it yesterday  and admire it to day       but you are tired of admiring it  i see  well  we shall not force you  to be in raptures with it  shall we  miss portman  a man may be tired of  the most beautiful face in the world  or the most beautiful picture   but really there is so much sweetness  so much innocence  such tender  melancholy in this countenance  that  if i were a man  i should  inevitably be in love with it  and in love for ever  such beauty  if it  were in nature  would certainly fix the most inconstant man upon earth      belinda ventured to take her eyes for an instant from the picture  to  see whether clarence hervey looked like the most inconstant man upon  earth  he was intently gazing upon her  but as soon as she looked  round  he suddenly exclaimed  as he turned to the picture   a heavenly  countenance  indeed   the painter has done justice to the poet       poet   repeated lady delacour   the man s in the clouds       pardon me   said clarence   does not m  de st  pierre deserve to  be called a poet  though he does not write in rhyme  surely he has a  poetical imagination       certainly   said belinda  and from the composure with which mr  hervey  now spoke  she was suddenly inclined to believe  or to hope  that all  sir philip s story was false   m  de st  pierre undoubtedly has a great  deal of imagination  and deserves to be called a poet       very likely  good people   said lady delacour   but what has that to do  with the present purpose       nay   cried clarence   your ladyship certainly sees that this is st   pierre s virginia       st  pierre s virginia  oh  i know who it is  clarence  as well as you  do  i am not quite so blind  or so stupid  as you take me to be   then  recollecting her promise  not to betray sir philip s secret  she added   pointing to the landscape of the picture   these cocoa trees  this  fountain  and the words  fontaine de virginie   inscribed on the rock  i  must have been stupidity itself  if i had not found it out  i absolutely   can  read  clarence  and spell  and put together  but here comes sir  philip baddely  who  i believe  cannot read  for i sent him an hour ago  for a catalogue  and he pores over the book as if he had not yet made  out the title      sir philip had purposely delayed  because he was afraid of rejoining  lady delacour whilst clarence hervey was with her  and whilst they were  talking of the picture of virginia      here s the catalogue  here s the picture your ladyship wants  st   pierre s virginia  damme  i never heard of that fellow before  he is  some new painter  damme  that is the reason i did not know the hand  not  a word of what i told you  lady delacour  you won t blow us to clary    added he  aside  to her ladyship   rochfort keeps aloof  and so will i   damme      a gentleman at this instant beckoned to mr  hervey with an air of great  eagerness  clarence went and spoke to him  then returned with an altered  countenance  and apologized to lady delacour for not dining with her  as  he had promised  business  he said  of great importance required that he  should leave town immediately  helena had just taken miss portman into a  little room  where westall s drawings were hung  to show her a group  of lady anne percival and her children  and belinda was alone with  the little girl  when mr  hervey came to bid her adieu  he was in much  agitation      miss portman  i shall not  i am afraid  see you again for some  time   perhaps i may never have that  hem   happiness  i had something  of importance that i wished to say to you before i left town  but i  am forced to go so suddenly  i can hardly hope for any moment but the  present to speak to you  madam  may i ask whether you purpose remaining  much longer with lady delacour       yes   said belinda  much surprised   i believe  i am not quite  certain  but i believe i shall stay with her ladyship some time longer      mr  hervey looked painfully embarrassed  and his eyes involuntarily fell  upon little helena  helena drew her hand gently away from belinda  left  the room  and retired to her mother      that child  miss portman  is very fond of you   said mr  hervey   again he paused  and looked round to see whether he could be overheard    pardon me for what i am going to say  this is not a proper place  i  must be abrupt  for i am so circumstanced  that i have not a moment s  time to spare  may i speak to you with the sincerity of a friend       yes  speak to me with sincerity   said belinda   and you will deserve  that i should think you my friend   she trembled excessively  but spoke  and looked with all the firmness that she could command      i have heard a report   said mr  hervey   which is most injurious to  you       to me       yes  no one can escape calumny  it is whispered  that if lady delacour  should die        at the word  die   belinda started      that if lady delacour should die  miss portman would become the mother  of helena       good heavens  what an absurd report  surely  you  could not for an  instant believe it  mr  hervey       not for an instant  but i resolved  as soon as i heard it  to mention  it to you  for i believe that half the miseries of the world arise from  foolish mysteries  from the want of courage to speak the truth  now that  you are upon your guard  your own prudence will defend you sufficiently   i never saw any of your sex who appeared to me to have so much prudence   and so little art  but  farewell  i have not a moment to lose   added  clarence  suddenly checking himself  and he hurried away from belinda   who stood fixed to the spot where he left her  till she was roused by  the voices of several people who came into the room to see the drawings   she started as if from a dream  and went immediately in search of lady  delacour     sir philip baddely was in earnest conversation with her ladyship  but  he stopped speaking when belinda came within hearing  and lady delacour  turned to helena  and said   my dear  if you are satisfied  for mercy s  sake let us be gone  for i am absolutely overcome with heat  and with  curiosity   added she in a low voice to belinda   i long to hear how  clarence hervey likes westall s drawings      as soon as they got home  lady delacour sent her daughter to practise  a new lesson upon the piano forte   and now sit down  my dear belinda    said she   and satisfy my curiosity  it is the curiosity of a friend   not of an impertinent busybody  has clarence declared himself  he chose  an odd time and place  but that is no matter  i forgive him  and so  do you  i dare say  but why do you tear that unfortunate carnation to  pieces  surely you cannot be embarrassed in speaking to me  what s  the matter  i once did tell you  that i would not give up my claim to  clarence s adorations during my life  but i intend to live a few years  longer after the amazonian operation is performed  you know  and i could  not have the conscience to keep you waiting whole years  it is better  to do things with a good grace  lest one should be forced at last to do  them with an ill grace  therefore i give up all manner of claim to  every thing but  flattery  that of course you will allow me from poor  clarence  so now do not begin upon another flower  but  without any  farther superfluous modesty  let me hear all the pretty things clarence  said or swore      whilst belinda was pulling the carnation to pieces  she recollected what  mr  hervey had said to her about mysteries  his words still sounded  in her ear    i believe that half the miseries of the world arise from  foolish mysteries  from the want of courage to speak the truth    i will  have the courage to speak the truth  thought she  whatever it may cost  me      the only pretty thing that mr  hervey said was  that he never saw any  woman who had so much prudence and so little art   said belinda      a very pretty thing indeed  my dear  but it might have been said in  open court by your grandfather  or your great grandfather  i am sorry   if that was all  that helena did not stay to hear such a charming moral  compliment   moralite a la glace   the last thing i should have expected  in a  tete a tete  with clarence hervey  was it worth while to pull that  poor flower to pieces for such a pretty speech as this  and so that was  all       no  not all  but you overpower me with your wit  and i cannot stand the   lightning of your eyes        there   said her ladyship  letting down her veil over her face   the  fire of my eyes is not too much for you now       helena was showing me westall s drawing of lady anne percival and her  children        and mr  hervey wished that he was the father of such a charming group  of children  and you the mother  hey  was not that it  it was not put in  such plain terms  but that was the purport  i presume       no  not at all  he said nothing about lady anne percival s children   but        but  why then did you bring in her ladyship and her children  to gain  time   bad policy   never  whilst you live  when you have a story  to tell  bring in a parcel of people who have nothing to do with the  beginning  the middle  or the end of it  how could i suspect you of  such false taste  i really imagined these children were essential to the  business  but i beg pardon for giving you these elements of criticism  i  assure you i interrupt you  and talk on so fast  from pure good nature   to give you time to recollect yourself  for i know you ve the worst of  memories  especially for what clarence hervey says  but come  my dear   dash into the middle of things at once  in the true epic style       then to dash into the midst of things at once   said miss portman   speaking very quick   mr  hervey observed that miss delacour was growing  very fond of me       miss delacour  did you say   cried her ladyship    et puis       at this instant champfort opened the door  looked in  and seeing lady  delacour  immediately retired      champfort  whom do you want  or what do you want   said her ladyship      miladi  c est que  i did come from milord  to see if miladi and  mademoiselle were visible  i did tink miladi was not at home       you see i am at home  though   said her ladyship   has lord delacour  any business with me       no  miladi  not with miladi   said champfort   it was with  mademoiselle       with me  monsieur champfort  then you will be so good as to tell lord  delacour i am here       and that  i  am not here  champfort  for i must be gone to dress      she rose hastily to leave the room  but miss portman caught her hand    you won t go  i hope  lady delacour   said she   till i have finished  my long story   lady delacour sat down again  ashamed of her own  embarrassment     whether this be art  innocence  or assurance  thought she  i cannot  tell  but we shall see     lord delacour now came in  with a half unfolded newspaper  and a packet  of letters in his hand  he came to apologize to miss portman for having   by mistake  broken the seal of a letter to her  which had been sent  under cover to him  he had simply asked champfort whether the ladies  were at home  that he might not have the trouble of going up stairs if  they were out  monsieur champfort possessed  in an eminent degree  the  mischievous art of appearing mysterious about the simplest things in the  world      though i was so thoughtless as to break the seal before i looked at the  direction of the letter   said lord delacour   i assure you i went no  farther than the first three words  for i knew  my dear niece  could not  possibly mean me   he gave miss portman the letter  and left the  room  this explanation was perfectly satisfactory to belinda  but lady  delacour  prejudiced by the hesitation of champfort  could not help  suspecting that this letter was merely the ostensible cause of his  lordship s visit      from my aunt stanhope   said miss portman  as she opened her letter   she folded it up again after glancing over the first page  and put it  into her pocket  colouring deeply     all lady delacour s suspicions about mrs  stanhope s epistolary counsels  and secrets instantly recurred  with almost the force of conviction to  her mind      miss portman   said she   i hope your politeness to me does not prevent  you from reading your letter  some ceremonious people think it vastly  rude to read a letter in company  but i am not one of them  i can write  whilst you read  for i have fifty notes and more to answer  so pray read  your letter at your ease      belinda had but just unfolded her letter again  when lord delacour  returned  followed by champfort  who brought with him a splendid  hammer cloth      here  my dear lady delacour   said his lordship   is a little surprise  for you  here is a new hammer cloth  of my bespeaking and taste  which i  hope you will approve of       very handsome  upon my word   said lady delacour  coldly  and she fixed  her eyes upon the fringe  which was black and orange   miss portman s  taste  i see       did you not say black and orange fringe  my dear       no  i said blue and white  my lord      his lordship declared he did not know how the mistake had happened  it  was merely a mistake   but her ladyship was convinced that it was  done on purpose  and she said to herself   miss portman will order my  liveries next  i have not even the shadow of power left in my own house   i am not treated with even a decent show of respect  but this shall go  on till i have full conviction of her views      dissembling her displeasure  she praised the hammer cloth  and  especially the fringe  lord delacour retired satisfied  and miss portman  sat down to read the following letter from her aunt stanhope           chapter xv     jealousy        crescent  bath  july  wednesday      my dear niece      i received safely the bank notes for my two hundred guineas  enclosed  in your last  but you should never trust unnecessarily in this manner to  the post  always  when you are obliged to send bank notes by post  cut  them in two  and send half by one post and half by another  this is  what is done by all prudent people  prudence  whether in trifles or  in matters of consequence  can be learned only by experience  which is  often too dearly bought   or by listening  which costs nothing  to the  suggestions of those who have a thorough knowledge of the world      a report has just reached me concerning you and  a certain lord   which  gives me the most heartfelt concern  i always knew  and told you  that  you were  a great favourite  with the person in question  i depended  on your prudence  delicacy  and principles  to understand this hint  properly  and i trusted that you would conduct yourself accordingly   it is too plain   from the report alluded to   that there has been some  misconduct or mis management somewhere  the misconduct i cannot  the  mis management i must  attribute to you  my dear  for let a man s  admiration for any woman be ever so great  unless she suffer herself  to be dazzled by vanity  or unless she be naturally of an inconsiderate  temper  she can surely prevent his partiality from becoming so glaring  as to excite envy  envy is always to be dreaded by handsome young women   as being  sooner or later  infallibly followed by scandal  of this   i fear  you have not been sufficiently aware  and you see the  consequences  consequences which  to a female of genuine delicacy or of  real good sense  must be extremely alarming  men of contracted minds and  cold tempers  who are absolutely incapable of feeling generous passion  for our sex  are often unaccountably ambitious to gain the reputation  of being  well  with any woman whose beauty  accomplishments  or  connexions  may have brought her into fashion  whatever affection may be  pretended  this is frequently the  ultimate  and  sole  object of these  selfish creatures  whether or not the person i have in my eye deserves  to be included in this class  i will not presume positively to  determine  but you  who have personal opportunities of observation   may decide this point  if you have any curiosity on the subject  by  observing whether he most affects to pay his devoirs to you in public or  in private  if the latter be the case  it is the most dangerous  because  a man even of the most contracted understanding has always sense or  instinct enough to feel that the slightest taint in the reputation  of the woman who is  or who is to be  his wife  would affect his own  private peace  or his honour in the eyes of the world  a husband who  has in a first marriage been  as it is said  in constant fear both of  matrimonial subjugation and disgrace  would  in his choice of a second  lady  be peculiarly nice  and probably  tardy   any degree of favour  that might have been shown him  any report that may have been raised   and above all  any restraint he might feel himself under from  implied engagement  or from the discovery or reputation of superior  understanding and talents in the object beloved  would operate  infallibly against her  to the confusion of all her plans  and the  ruin at once of her reputation  her peace of mind  and her hopes of an  establishment  nay  supposing the best that could possibly happen  that   after playing with the utmost dexterity this desperate game  the pool  were absolutely your own  yet  if there were any suspicions of unfair  play buzzed about amongst the by standers  you would not in the main be  a gainer  for my dear  without character  what is even wealth  or all  that wealth can bestow  i do not mean to trouble you with stale wise  sayings  which young people hate  nor musty morality  which is seldom  fit for use in the world  or which smells too much of books to be  brought into good company  this is not my way of giving advice  but i  only beg you to observe what actually passes before your eyes in the  circle in which we live  ladies of the best families  with rank and  fortune  and beauty and fashion  and every thing in their favour  cannot   as yet in this country  dispense with the strictest observance of the  rules of virtue and decorum  some have fancied themselves raised so high  above the vulgar as to be in no danger from the thunder and lightning  of public opinion  but these ladies in the clouds have found themselves  mistaken  they have been blasted  and have fallen nobody knows where   what is become of lady       and the countess of       and others i  could mention  who were as high as envy could look  i remember seeing  the countess of       who was then the most beautiful creature my eyes  ever beheld  and the most admired that ever was heard of  come into  the opera house  and sit the whole night in her box without any woman s  speaking or courtesying to her  or taking any more notice of her than  you would of a post  or a beggar woman  even a coronet cannot protect  a woman  you see  from disgrace  if she falls  she and it  and all  together  are trampled under foot  but why should i address all this to  my dear niece  whither have the terror and confusion i was thrown into  by this strange report about you and lord      led me  and yet  one cannot be too cautious   ce n est que le premier  mot  qui  coute   scandal never stops after the first word  unless she be  instantly gagged by a dexterous hand  nothing shall be wanting on my  part  but you alone are the person who can do any thing effectual do not  imagine that i would have you quit lady      that is the first idea   i know  that will come into your silly little head  but put it out  directly  if you were upon this attack to quit the field of battle  you  yield the victory to your enemies  to leave lady     s house would be  folly and madness  as long as she is your friend  or  appears  such   all is safe  but any coolness on her part would  in the present  circumstances  be death to your reputation  and  even if you were to  leave her on the best terms possible  the malicious world would say  that you left her on the worst  and would assign as a reason the report  alluded to  people who have not yet believed it would then conclude  that it must be true  and thus by your cowardice you would furnish an  incontrovertible argument against your innocence  i therefore desire  that you will not  upon any account  think of coming home to me at  present  indeed  i hope your own good sense would prevent you from  wishing it  after the reasons that i have given  far from quitting lady       from false delicacy  it is your business  from consideration for  her peace  as well as your own  to redouble your attentions to her in  private  and  above all things  to appear as much as possible with her  in public  i am glad to hear her health is so far reestablished  that  she  can  appear again in public  her spirits  as you may hint  will be  the better for a little amusement  luckily  you have it completely in  your power to convince her and all the world of the correctness of your  mind  i believe i certainly should have fainted  my dear  when i first  heard this shocking report  if i had not just afterward received a  letter from sir philip baddely which revived me  his proposal at this  crisis for you  my dear  is a charming thing  you have nothing to do but  to encourage his addresses immediately   the report dies away of itself   and all is just as your best friends wish  such an establishment for  you  my dear  is indeed beyond their most sanguine expectations  sir  philip hints in his letter  that my influence might be wanting with you  in his favour  but this surely cannot be  as i have told him  he has  merely mistaken becoming female reserve for a want of sensibility on  your part  which would be equally unnatural and absurd  do you know  my  dear  that sir philip baddely has an estate of fifteen thousand a year  in wiltshire  and his uncle barton s estate in norfolk will  in due  time  pay his debts  then  as to family  look in the lists of baronets  in your pocket book  and surely  my love  an old baronetage in actual  possession is worth something more than the reversion of a new coronet   supposing that such a thing could properly be thought of  which heaven  forbid  so i see no possible objection to sir philip  my dear belinda   and i am sure you have too much candour and good sense to make any  childish or romantic difficulties  sir philip is not  i know  a man of  what you call genius  so much the better  my dear  those men of genius  are dangerous husbands  they have so many oddities and eccentricities   there is no managing them  though they are mighty pleasant men in  company to enliven conversation  for example  your favourite  clarence  hervey  as it is well known he is not a marrying man  you never can have  thought of him  you are not a girl to expose yourself to the ridicule    c   of all your female acquaintance by romance and nonsense  i  cannot conceive that a niece of mine could degrade herself by a mean  prepossession for a man who has never made any declaration of his  attachment to her  and who  i am sure  feels no such attachment   that you may not deceive yourself  it is fit i should tell you  what  otherwise it might not be so proper to mention to a young lady  that  he keeps and has kept a mistress for some years  and those who are most  intimately in his confidence have assured me that  if ever he marries  any body  he will marry this girl  which is not impossible  considering  that she is  they say  the most beautiful young creature that ever was  seen  and he  a man of genius   if you have any sense or spirit  i have  said enough  so adieu   let me hear  by return of the post  that every  thing is going on as it should do  i am impatient to write to your  sister tollemache this good news  i always foretold that my belinda  would marry better than her sister  or any of her cousins  and take  place of them all  are not you obliged to me for sending you this winter  to town to lady       it was an admirable hit  pray tell lady delacour   with my best compliments  that our  aloe  friend  her ladyship will  understand me  cheated a gentleman of my acquaintance the other day  at  casino  out of seventy guineas  he hates the sight of her odious red wig  as much now as we always did  i knew  and told lady d      as she will  do me the justice to remember  that mrs     cheated at play  what a  contemptible character   pray  my dear  do not forget to tell lady  delacour  that i have a charming anecdote for her  about another   friend  of ours  who has lately gone over to the enemy  has her  ladyship seen a manuscript that is handed about as a great secret  and  said to be by       a parallel between  our friend  and the chevalier  d eon  it is done with infinite wit and humour  in the manner of  plutarch  i would send a copy  but am afraid my frank would be too heavy  if i began upon another sheet  so once more adieu  my dear niece  write  to me without fail  and mention sir philip  i have written to him to  give my approbation   c      yours sincerely      selina stanhope       mrs  stanhope seems to have written you a volume instead of a letter   miss portman   cried lady delacour  as belinda turned over the sheets  of her aunt s long epistle  she did not attempt to read it regularly  through  some passages here and there were sufficient to astonish and  shock her extremely   no bad news  i hope   said lady delacour  again  looking up from her writing at belinda  who sat motionless  leaning  her head upon her hand  as if deep in thought  mrs  stanhope s  unfolded letter hanging from her hand  in the midst of the variety of  embarrassing  painful  and alarming feelings excited by this letter  she  had sufficient strength of mind to adhere to her resolution of speaking  the exact truth to lady delacour  when she was roused by her ladyship s  question   no bad news  i hope  miss portman   she instantly answered   with all the firmness she could command   yes  my aunt has been alarmed  by a strange report which i heard myself for the first time this morning  from mr  hervey  i am sure i am much obliged to him for having the  courage to speak the truth to me   here she repeated what mr  hervey had  said to her  lady delacour never raised her eyes whilst belinda spoke   but went on scratching out some words in what she was writing  through  the mask of paint which she wore no change of colour could be visible   and as belinda did not see the expression of her ladyship s eyes  she  could not in the least judge of what was passing in her mind      mr  hervey has acted like a man of honour and sense   said lady  delacour   but it is a pity  for your sake  he did not speak  sooner  before this report became so public  before it reached bath  and  your aunt  though it could not surprise her much  she has such a perfect  knowledge of the world  and          lady delacour uttered these broken sentences in a voice of suppressed  anger  cleared her throat several times  and at last  unable to speak   stopped short  and then began with much precipitation to put wafers into  several notes that she had been writing  so it has reached bath  thought  she  the report is public  i never till now heard a hint of any such  thing except from sir philip baddely  but it has doubtless been the  common talk of the town  and i am laughed at as a dupe and an idiot  as  i am  and now  when the thing can he concealed no longer  she comes to  me with that face of simplicity  and knowing my generous temper  throws  herself on my mercy  and trusts that her speaking to me with this  audacious plainness will convince me of her innocence   you have acted  in the most prudent manner possible  miss portman   said her ladyship   as she went on sealing her notes   by speaking at once to me of this  strange  scandalous  absurd report  do you act from your aunt stanhope s  advice  or entirely from your own judgment and knowledge of my  character       from my own judgment and knowledge of your character  in which i  hope  i am not  i cannot be mistaken   said belinda  looking at her with  a mixture of doubt and astonishment      no  you calculated admirably   twas the best  the only thing you could  do  only   said her ladyship  falling back in her chair with an hysteric  laugh   only the blunder of champfort  and the entrance of my lord  delacour  and the hammercloth with the orange and black fringe  forgive  me  my dear  for the soul of me i can t help laughing  it was rather  unlucky  so awkward  such a contretemps  but you   added she  wiping her  eyes  as if recovering from laughter   you have such admirable presence  of mind  nothing disconcerts you  you are equal to all situations   and stand in no need of such long letters of advice from your aunt  stanhope   pointing to the two folio sheets which lay at belinda s feet     the rapid  unconnected manner in which lady delacour spoke  the hurry of  her motions  the quick  suspicious  angry glances of her eye  her laugh   her unintelligible words  all conspired at this moment to give belinda  the idea that her intellects were suddenly disordered  she was so firmly  persuaded of her ladyship s utter indifference to lord delacour  that  she never conceived the possibility of her being actuated by the passion  of jealousy  by the jealousy of power  a species of jealousy which she  had never felt  and could not comprehend  but she had sometimes seen  lady delacour in starts of passion that seemed to border on insanity   and the idea of her losing all command of her reason now struck belinda  with irresistible force  she felt the necessity of preserving her own  composure  and with all the calmness that she could assume  she took  up her aunt stanhope s letter  and looked for the passage in which mrs   luttridge and harriot freke were mentioned  if i can turn the course of  lady delacour s mind  thought she  or catch her attention  perhaps she  will recover herself   here is a message to you  my dear lady delacour    cried she   from my aunt stanhope  about  about mrs  luttridge      miss portman s hand trembled as she turned over the pages of the letter    i am all attention   said lady delacour  with a composed voice   only  take care  don t make a mistake  i m in no hurry  don t read any thing  mrs  stanhope might not wish  it is dangerous to garble letters  almost  as dangerous as to snatch them out of a friend s hand  as i once did   you know  but you need not now be under the least alarm      conscious that this letter was not fit for her ladyship to see  belinda  neither offered to show it to her  nor attempted any apology for  her reserve and embarrassment  but hastily began to read the message  relative to mrs  luttridge  her voice gaining confidence as she went on   as she observed that she had fixed lady delacour s attention  who now  sat listening to her  calm and motionless  but when miss portman came  to the words   do not forget to tell lady d       that i have a charming  anecdote for her about another  friend  of hers  who lately went over  to the enemy   her ladyship exclaimed with great vehemence     friend    harriot freke   yes  like all other friends  harriot  freke   what was she compared to   tis too much for me  too much   and  she put her hand to her head      compose yourself  my dear  friend    said belinda  in a calm  gentle  tone  and she went toward her with an intention of soothing her by  caresses  but  at her approach  lady delacour pushed the table on which  she had been writing from her with violence  started up  flung back the  veil which fell over her face as she rose  and darted upon belinda a  look  which fixed her to the spot where she stood  it said   come not a  step nearer  at your peril   belinda s blood ran cold  she had no longer  any doubt that this was insanity  she shut the penknife which lay upon  the table  and put it into her pocket      cowardly creature   cried lady delacour  and her countenance changed to  the expression of ineffable contempt   what is it you fear       that you should injure yourself  sit down  for heaven s sake listen to  me  to your friend  to belinda       my friend  my belinda   cried lady delacour  and she turned from her   and walked away some steps in silence  then suddenly clasping her hands   she raised her eyes to heaven with a fervent but wild expression of  devotion  and exclaimed   great god of heaven  my punishment is just   the death of lawless is avenged  may the present agony of my soul  expiate my folly  of guilt  deliberate guilt  of hypocrisy  treachery  i  have not  oh  never may i have  to repent      she paused  her eyes involuntarily returned upon belinda   oh  belinda   you  whom i have so loved  so trusted      the tears rolled fast down her painted cheeks  she wiped them hastily  away  and so roughly  that her face became a strange and ghastly  spectacle  unconscious of her disordered appearance  she rushed past  belinda  who vainly attempted to stop her  threw up the sash  and  stretching herself far out of the window  gasped for breath  miss  portman drew her back  and closed the window  saying   the rouge is all  off your face  my dear lady delacour  you are not fit to be seen  sit  down upon this sofa  and i will ring for marriott  and get some fresh  rouge  look at your face in this glass  you see        i see   interrupted lady delacour  looking full at belinda   that she  who i thought had the noblest of souls has the meanest  i see that she  is incapable of feeling   rouge  not fit to be seen    at such a time  as this  to talk to me in this manner  oh  niece of mrs   stanhope   dupe   dupe that i am   she flung herself upon the sofa   and struck her forehead with her hand violently several times  belinda  catching her arm  and holding it with all her force  cried in a tone of  authority   command yourself  lady delacour  i conjure you  or you will  go out of your senses  and if you do  your secret will be discovered by  the whole world       hold me not  you have no right   cried lady delacour  struggling to  free her hand   all powerful as you are in this house  you have no  longer any power over me  i am not going out of my senses  you cannot  get me into bedlam  all powerful  all artful as you are  you have done  enough to drive me mad  but i am not mad  no wonder you cannot believe  me  no wonder you are astonished at the strong expression of feelings  that are foreign to your nature  no wonder that you mistake the  writhings of the heart  the agony of a generous soul  for madness  look  not so terrified  i will do you no injury  do not you hear that i can  lower my voice   do not you see that i can be calm  could mrs  stanhope  herself  could  you   miss portman  speak in a softer  milder  more  polite  more proper tone than i do now  are you pleased  are you  satisfied       i am better satisfied  a little better satisfied   said belinda      that s well  but still you tremble  there s not the least occasion for  apprehension  you see i can command myself  and smile upon you       oh  do not smile in that horrid manner       why not    horrid   don t you love deceit       i detest it from my soul       indeed   said lady delacour  still speaking in the same low  soft   unnatural voice   then why do you practise it  my love       i never practised it for a moment  i am incapable of deceit  when you  are  really  calm  when you can  really  command yourself  you will do  me justice  lady delacour  but now it is my business  if i can  to bear  with you       you are goodness itself  and gentleness  and prudence personified  you  know perfectly how to  manage  a friend  whom you fear you have driven  just to the verge of madness  but tell me  good  gentle  prudent miss  portman  why need you dread so much that i should go mad  you know  if  i went mad  nobody would mind  nobody would believe whatever i say  i  should be no evidence against you  and i should be out of your way  sufficiently  shouldn t i  and you would have all the power in your own  hands  would not you  and would not this be almost as well as if i were  dead and buried  no  your calculations are better than mine  the poor  mad wife would still be in your way  would yet stand between you and the  fond object of your secret soul  a coronet      as she pronounced the word  coronet   she pointed to a coronet set  in diamonds on her watch case  which lay on the table  then suddenly  seizing the watch  she dashed it upon the marble hearth with all her  force   vile bauble   cried she   must i lose my only friend for such  a thing as you  oh  belinda  do you see that a coronet cannot confer  happiness       i have seen it long  i pity you from the bottom of my soul   said  belinda  bursting into tears      pity me not  i cannot endure your pity  treacherous woman   cried  lady delacour  and she stamped with a look of rage   most perfidious of  women       yes  call me perfidious  treacherous  stamp at me  say  do what you  will  i can and will bear it all  all patiently  for i am innocent  and  you are mistaken and unhappy   said belinda   you will love me when you  return to your senses  then how can i be angry with you       fondle me not   said lady delacour  starting back from belinda s  caresses   do not degrade yourself to no purpose  i never more can be  your dupe  your protestations of innocence are wasted on me  i am not so  blind as you imagine  dupe as you think me  i have seen much in silence   the whole world  you find  suspects you now  to save your reputation   you want my friendship  you want        i want nothing from you  lady delacour   said belinda    you have  suspected me long in silence   then i have mistaken your character  i  can love you no longer  farewell for ever  find another  a better  friend      she walked away from lady delacour with proud indignation  but  before  she reached the door  she recollected her promise to remain with this  unfortunate woman     is a dying woman  in the paroxysm of insane passion  a fit object  of indignation  thought belinda  and she stopped short   no  lady  delacour   cried she   i will not yield to my humour  i will not listen  to my pride  a few words said in the heat of passion shall not make me  forget myself or you  you have given me your confidence  i am grateful  for it  i cannot  will not desert you  my promise is sacred       your promise   said lady delacour  contemptuously   i absolve you from  your promise  unless you find it  convenient  to yourself to remember  it  pray let it be forgotten  and if i must die       at this instant the door opened suddenly  and little helena came in  singing            merrily  merrily shall we live now       under the blossom that hangs on the bough      what comes next  miss portman      lady delacour dragged her veil across her face  and rushed out of the  room      what is the matter   is mamma ill       yes  my dear   said belinda  but at this instant she heard the sound of  lord delacour s voice upon the stairs  she broke from the little girl   and with the greatest precipitation retreated to her own room     she had not been alone above an hour before marriott knocked at the  door      miss portman  you don t know how late it is  lady singleton and the  miss singletons are come  but  merciful heaven   exclaimed marriott  as  she entered the room   what is all this packing up  what is this trunk       i am going to oakly park with lady anne percival   said belinda   calmly      i thought there was something wrong  my mind misgave me all the time i  was dressing my lady   she was in such a flutter  and never spoke to me   i d lay my life this is  some way or other  mr  champfort s doings  but   good dear miss portman  can you leave my poor lady when she wants you  so much  and i ll take upon me to say  ma am  loves you so much at the  bottom of her heart  dear me  how your face is flushed  pray let me pack  up these things  if it must be  but i do hope  if it be possible  that  you should stay  however  i ve no business to speak  i beg pardon for  being so impertinent  i hope you won t take it ill   it is only from  regard to my poor lady i ventured to speak       your regard to your lady deserves the highest approbation  marriott    said belinda   it is impossible that i should stay with her any longer   when i am gone  good marriott  and when her health and strength decline   your fidelity and your services will be absolutely necessary to your  mistress  and from what i have seen of the goodness of your heart  i  am convinced that the more she is in want of you  the more  respectful   will be your attention      marriott answered only by her tears  and went on packing up in a great  hurry     nothing could equal lady delacour s astonishment when she learnt from  marriott that miss portman was actually preparing to leave the house   after a moment s reflection  however  she persuaded herself that this  was only a new artifice to work upon her affections  that belinda did  not mean to leave her  but that she would venture all lengths  in hopes  of being at the last moment pressed to stay  under this persuasion  lady  delacour resolved to disappoint her expectations  she determined to meet  her with that polite coldness which would best become her own dignity   and which  without infringing the laws of hospitality  would effectually  point out to the world that lady delacour was no dupe  and that miss  portman was an unwelcome inmate in her house     the power of assuming gaiety when her heart was a prey to the most  poignant feelings  she had completely acquired by long practice  with  the promptitude of an actress  she could instantly appear upon the  stage  and support a character totally foreign to her own  the loud  knocks at the door  which announced the arrival of company  were signals  that operated punctually upon her associations  and to this species of  conventional necessity her most violent passions submitted with magical  celerity  fresh rouged  and beautifully dressed  she was performing her  part to a brilliant audience in her drawing room when belinda entered   belinda beheld her with much astonishment  but more pity      miss portman   said her ladyship  turning carelessly towards her    where do you buy your rouge   lady singleton  would you rather at this  moment be mistress of the philosopher s stone  or have a patent for  rouge that will come and go like miss portman s   apropos  have you read  st  leon   her ladyship was running on to a fresh train of ideas  when a  footman announced the arrival of lady anne percival s carriage  and miss  portman rose to depart      you dine with lady anne  miss portman  i understand   my compliments to  her ladyship  and my duty to mrs  margaret delacour  and her macaw   au  revoir   though you talk of running away from me to oakly park  i am  sure you will do no such cruel thing  i am  with all due humility  so  confident of the irresistible attractions of this house  that i defy  oakly park and all its charms  so  miss portman  instead of adieu  i  shall only say   au revoir        adieu  lady delacour   said belinda  with a look and tone which struck  her ladyship to the heart  all her suspicions  all her pride  all her  affected gaiety vanished  her presence of mind forsook her  and for some  moments she stood motionless and powerless  then recollecting herself   she flew after miss portman  abruptly stopped her at the head of the  stairs  and exclaimed   my dearest belinda  are you gone   my best  my  only friend   say you are not gone for ever   say you will return       adieu   repeated belinda  it was all she could say  she broke from lady  delacour  and hurried out of the house with the strongest feeling of  compassion for this unhappy woman  but with an unaltered sense of the  propriety and necessity of her own firmness           chapter xvi     domestic happiness       there was an air of benevolence and perfect sincerity in the politeness  with which lady anne percival received belinda  that was peculiarly  agreeable to her agitated and harassed mind      you see  lady anne   said belinda   that i come to you at last  after  having so often refused your kind invitations       so you surrender yourself at discretion  just when i was going to raise  the siege in despair   said lady anne   now i may make my own terms  and  the only terms i shall impose are  that you will stay at oakly park with  us  as long as we can make it agreeable to you  and no longer  whether  those who cease to please  or those who cease to be pleased  are most to  blame     it may sometimes be difficult to determine  so difficult   that when this becomes a question between two friends  they perhaps had  better part than venture upon the discussion      lady anne percival could not avoid suspecting that something  disagreeable had passed between lady delacour and belinda  but she  was not troubled with the disease of idle curiosity  and her example  prevailed upon mrs  margaret delacour  who dined with her  to refrain  from all questions and comments     the prejudice which this lady had conceived against our heroine  as  being a niece of mrs  stanhope s  had lately been vanquished by the  favourable representations of her conduct which she had heard from her  nephew  and by the kindness that belinda had shown to little helena      madam   said mrs  delacour  addressing herself to miss portman  with some formality  but much dignity   permit me  as one of my lord  delacour s nearest relations now living  to return you my thanks for  having  as my nephew informs me  exerted your influence over lady  delacour for the happiness of his family  my little helena  i am sure   feels her obligations towards you  and i rejoice that i have had an  opportunity of expressing  in person  my sense of what our family owes  to miss portman  as to the rest  her own heart will reward her  the  praise of the world is but an inferior consideration  however  it  deserves to be mentioned  as an instance of the world s candour  and  for the singularity of the case  that every body agrees in speaking well  even of so handsome a young lady as miss portman       she must have had extraordinary prudence   said lady anne   and the  world does justly to reward it with extraordinary esteem      belinda  with equal pleasure and surprise  observed that all this was  said sincerely  and that the report  which she had feared was public   had never reached mrs  delacour or lady anne percival     in fact  it was known and believed only by those who had been prejudiced  by the malice or folly of sir philip baddely  piqued by the manner in  which his addresses had been received by belinda  he readily listened to  the comfortable words of his valet de chambre  who assured him that he  had it from the best possible authority  lord delacour s own gentleman   mr  champfort   that his lordship was deeply  taken  with miss  portman  that the young lady managed every thing in the house  that she  had been very prudent  to be sure  and had refused large presents  but  that there was no doubt of her becoming lady delacour  if ever his  lordship should be at liberty  sir philip was the person who mentioned  this to clarence hervey  and sir philip was the person who hinted it  to mrs  stanhope  in the very letter which he wrote to implore  her influence in favour of his own proposal  this manoeuvring lady  represented this report as being universally known and believed  in  hopes of frightening her niece into an immediate match with the baronet   in the whole extent of mrs  stanhope s politic imagination  she had  never foreseen the possibility of her niece s speaking the simple truth  to lady delacour  and she had never guarded against this danger  she  never thought of belinda s mentioning this report to her ladyship   because she would never have dealt so openly  had she been in the place  of her niece  thus her art and falsehood operated against her own views   and produced consequences diametrically opposite to her expectations   it was her exaggerations that made lady delacour believe  when belinda  repeated what she had said  that this report was universally known and  credited  her own suspicions were by these means again awakened  and her  jealousy and rage were raised to such a pitch  that  no longer mistress  of herself  she insulted her friend and guest  miss portman was then  obliged to do the very thing that mrs  stanhope most dreaded  to leave  lady delacour s house and all its advantages  as to sir philip baddely   belinda never thought of him from the moment she read her aunt s letter   till after she had left her ladyship  her mind was firmly decided upon  this subject  yet she could not help fearing that her aunt would not  understand her reasons  or approve her conduct  she wrote to mrs   stanhope in the most kind and respectful manner  assured her that there  had been no foundation whatever for the report which had produced  so much uneasiness  that lord delacour had always treated her with  politeness and good nature  but that such thoughts or views as had been  attributed to him  she was convinced had never entered his lordship s  mind  that hearing of the publicity of this report had  however   much  affected  lady d       i have  therefore   said belinda   thought it  prudent to quit her ladyship  and to accept of an invitation from lady  anne percival to oakly park  i hope  my dear aunt  that you will not be  displeased by my leaving town without seeing sir philip baddely again   our meeting could indeed answer no purpose  as it is entirely out of my  power to return his partiality  of his character  temper  and manners   i know enough to be convinced  that our union could tend only to make  us both miserable  after what i have seen  nothing can ever tempt me to  marry from any of the common views of interest or ambition      on this subject belinda  though she declared her own sentiments with  firm sincerity  touched as slightly as she could  because she anxiously  wished to avoid all appearance of  braving  the opinions of an aunt to  whom she was under obligations  she was tempted to pass over in silence  all that part of mrs  stanhope s letter which related to clarence  hervey  but upon reflection  she determined to conquer her repugnance  to speak of him  and to make perfect sincerity the steady rule of her  conduct  she therefore acknowledged to her aunt  that of all the persons  she had hitherto seen  this gentleman was the most agreeable to her  but  at the same time she assured her  that the refusal of sir philip baddely  was totally independent of all thoughts of mr  hervey  that  before she  had received her aunt s letter  circumstances had convinced her that mr   hervey was attached to another woman  she concluded by saying  that she  had neither romantic hopes nor wishes  and that her affections were at  her own command     belinda received the following angry answer from mrs  stanhope        henceforward  belinda  you may manage your own affairs as you think  proper  i shall never more interfere with my advice  refuse whom you  please  go where you please  get what friends  and what admirers  and  what establishment you can  i have nothing more to do with it  i will  never more undertake the management of young people  there s your sister  tollemache has made a pretty return for all my kindness  she is going to  be parted from her husband  and basely throws all the blame upon me  but   tis the same with all of you  there s your cousin joddrell refused me a  hundred guineas last week  though the piano forte and harp i bought  for her before she was married stood me in double that sum  and are  now useless lumber on my hands  and she never could have had joddrell  without them  as she knows as well as i do  as for mrs  levit  she  never writes to me  and takes no manner of notice of me  but this is no  matter  for her notice can be of no consequence now to any body  levit  has run out every thing he had in the world   all his fine estates  advertised in to day s paper  an execution in the house  i m told  i  expect that she will have the assurance to come to me in her distress   but she shall find my doors shut  i promise her  your cousin valleton s  match has  through her own folly  turned out like all the rest  she  her  husband  and all his relations are at daggers drawing  and valleton will  die soon  and won t leave her a farthing in his will  i foresee  and all  the fine valleton estate goes to god knows whom      if she had taken my advice after marriage as before  it would have been  all her own at this instant  but the passions run away with people  and  they forget every thing  common sense  gratitude  and all  as you  do  belinda  clarence hervey will never think of you  and i give you  up   now manage for yourself as you please  and as you can  i ll have  nothing more to do with the affairs of young ladies who will take no  advice      selina stanhope      p  s  if you return directly to lady delacour s  and marry sir philip  baddely  i will forgive the past      the regret which belinda felt at having grievously offended her aunt was  somewhat alleviated by the reflection that she had acted with integrity  and prudence  thrown off her guard by anger  mrs  stanhope had  inadvertently furnished her niece with the best possible reasons against  following her advice with regard to sir philip baddely  by stating that  her sister and cousins  who had married with mercenary views  had made  themselves miserable  and had shown their aunt neither gratitude nor  respect     the tranquillity of belinda s mind was gradually restored by the society  that she enjoyed at oakly park  she found herself in the midst of a  large and cheerful family  with whose domestic happiness she could  not forbear to sympathize  there was an affectionate confidence  an  unconstrained gaiety in this house  which forcibly struck her  from its  contrast with what she had seen at lady delacour s  she perceived that  between mr  percival and lady anne there was a union of interests   occupations  taste  and affection  she was at first astonished by the  openness with which they talked of their affairs in her presence  that  there were no family secrets  nor any of those petty mysteries  which arise from a discordance of temper or struggle for power  in  conversation  every person expressed without constraint their wishes and  opinions  and wherever these differed  reason and the general good were  the standards to which they appealed  the elder and younger part of the  family were not separated from each other  even the youngest child in  the house seemed to form part of the society  to have some share and  interest in the general occupations or amusements the children  were treated neither as slaves nor as playthings  but as reasonable  creatures  and the ease with which they were managed  and with which  they managed themselves  surprised belinda  for she heard none of that  continual lecturing which goes forward in some houses  to the great  fatigue and misery of all the parties concerned  and of all the  spectators  without force or any factitious excitements  the taste for  knowledge  and the habits of application  were induced by example  and  confirmed by sympathy  mr  percival was a man of science and literature   and his daily pursuits and general conversation were in the happiest  manner instructive and interesting to his family  his knowledge of the  world  and his natural gaiety of disposition  rendered his conversation  not only useful  but in the highest degree amusing  from the merest  trifles he could lead to some scientific fact  some happy literary  allusion  or philosophical investigation     lady anne percival had  without any pedantry or ostentation  much  accurate knowledge  and a taste for literature  which made her the  chosen companion of her husband s understanding  as well as of his  heart  he was not obliged to reserve his conversation for friends of  his own sex  nor was he forced to seclude himself in the pursuit of any  branch of knowledge  the partner of his warmest affections was also  the partner of his most serious occupations  and her sympathy and  approbation  and the daily sense of her success in the education of  their children  inspired him with a degree of happy social energy   unknown to the selfish solitary votaries of avarice and ambition     in this large and happy family there was a variety of pursuits  one  of the boys was fond of chemistry  another of gardening  one of the  daughters had a talent for painting  another for music  and all their  acquirements and accomplishments contributed to increase their mutual  happiness  for there was no envy or jealousy amongst them     those who unfortunately have never enjoyed domestic happiness  such as  we have just described  will perhaps suppose the picture to be visionary  and romantic  there are others  it is hoped many others  who will  feel that it is drawn from truth and real life  tastes that have been  vitiated by the stimulus of dissipation might  perhaps  think these  simple pleasures insipid     every body must ultimately judge of what makes them happy  from the  comparison of their own feelings in different situations  belinda was  convinced by this comparison  that domestic life was that which could  alone make her really and permanently happy  she missed none of the  pleasures  none of the gay company  to which she had been accustomed at  lady delacour s  she was conscious  at the end of each day  that it had  been agreeably spent  yet there were no extraordinary exertions made to  entertain her  every thing seemed in its natural course  and so did  her mind  where there was so much happiness  no want of what is called   pleasure  was ever experienced  she had not been at oakly park a week  before she forgot that it was within a few miles of harrowgate  and she  never once recollected her vicinity to this fashionable water drinking  place for a month afterwards      impossible   some young ladies will exclaim  we hope others will feel  that it was perfectly natural  but to deal fairly with our readers  we  must not omit to mention a certain mr  vincent  who came to oakly park  during the first week of belinda s visit  and who stayed there during  the whole succeeding month of felicity  mr  vincent was a creole  he was  about two and twenty  his person and manners were striking and engaging   he was tall  and remarkably handsome  he had large dark eyes  an  aquiline nose  fine hair  and a manly sunburnt complexion  his  countenance was open and friendly  and when he spoke upon any  interesting subject  it lighted up  and became full of fire and  animation  he used much gesture in conversation  he had not the common  manners of young men who are  or who aim at being thought  fashionable   but he was perfectly at ease in company  and all that was uncommon about  him appeared foreign  he had a frank  ardent temper  incapable of art  or dissimulation  and so unsuspicious of all mankind  that he could  scarcely believe falsehood existed in the world  even after he had  himself been its dupe  he was in extreme astonishment at the detection  of any species of baseness in a  gentleman   for he considered honour  and generosity as belonging indefeasibly  if not exclusively  to the  privileged orders  his notions of virtue were certainly aristocratic in  the extreme  but his ambition was to entertain such only as would best  support and dignify an aristocracy  his pride was magnanimous  not  insolent  and his social prejudices were such as  in some degree  to  supply the place of the power and habit of reasoning  in which he was  totally deficient  one principle of philosophy he practically possessed  in perfection  he enjoyed the present  undisturbed by any unavailing  regret for the past  or troublesome solicitude about the future  all the  goods of life he tasted with epicurean zest  all the evils he bore with  stoical indifference  the mere pleasure of existence seemed to keep him  in perpetual good humour with himself and others  and his never failing  flow of animal spirits exhilarated even the most phlegmatic  to persons  of a cold and reserved temper he sometimes appeared rather too much  of an egotist  for he talked with fluent enthusiasm of the excellent  qualities and beauties of whatever he loved  whether it were his dog   his horse  or his country  but this was not the egotism of vanity  it  was the overflowing of an affectionate heart  confident of obtaining  sympathy from his fellow creatures  because conscious of feeling it for  all that existed     he was as grateful as he was generous  and though high spirited and  impatient of restraint  he would submit with affectionate gentleness to  the voice of a friend  or listen with deference to the counsel of those  in whose superior judgment he had confidence  gratitude  respect  and  affection  all conspired to give mr  percival the strongest power over  his soul  mr  percival had been a guardian and a father to him  his own  father  an opulent merchant  on his death bed requested that his son   who was then about eighteen  might be immediately sent to england for  the advantages of a european education  mr  percival  who had a  regard for the father  arising from circumstances which it is not here  necessary to explain  accepted the charge of young vincent  and managed  so well  that his ward when he arrived at the age of twenty one did not  feel relieved from any restraint  on the contrary  his attachment to his  guardian increased from that period  when the laws gave him full command  over his fortune and his actions  mr  vincent had been at harrowgate for  some time before mr  percival came into the country  but as soon as  he heard of mr  percival s arrival  he left half finished a game of  billiards  of which  by the bye  he was extremely fond  to pay his  respects at oakly park  at the first sight of belinda  he did not seem  much struck with her appearance  perhaps  from his thinking that there  was too little languor in her eyes  and too much colour in her cheeks   he confessed that she was graceful  but her motions were not quite slow  enough to please him     it is somewhat singular that lady delacour s faithful friend  harriot  freke  should be the cause of mr  vincent s first fixing his favourable  attention on miss portman     he had a black servant of the name of juba  who was extremely attached  to him  he had known juba from a boy  and had brought him over with  him when he first came to england  because the poor fellow begged so  earnestly to go with young massa  juba had lived with him ever since   and accompanied him wherever he went  whilst he was at harrowgate  mr   vincent lodged in the same house with mrs  freke  some dispute arose  between their servants  about the right to a coach house  which each  party claimed as exclusively their own  the master of the house was  appealed to by juba  who sturdily maintained his massa s right  he  established it  and rolled his massa s curricle into the coach house in  triumph  mrs  freke  who heard and saw the whole transaction from her  window  said  or swore  that she would make juba repent of what she  called his insolence  the threat was loud enough to reach his ears  and  he looked up in astonishment to hear such a voice from a woman  but an  instant afterwards he began to sing very gaily  as he jumped into the  curricle to turn the cushions  and then danced himself up and down by  the springs  as if rejoicing in his victory  a second and a third time  mrs  freke repeated her threat  confirming it by an oath  and then  violently shut down the window and disappeared  mr  vincent  to whom  juba  with much simplicity  expressed his aversion of the  man woman   who lived in the house with them  laughed at the odd manner in which the  black imitated her voice and gesture  but thought no more of the matter   some time afterward  however  juba s spirits forsook him  he was never  heard to sing or to whistle  he scarcely ever spoke even to his master   who was much surprised by this sudden change from gaiety and loquacity  to melancholy taciturnity  nothing could draw from the poor fellow any  explanation of the cause of this alteration in his humour  and though  he seemed excessively grateful for the concern which his master showed  about his health  no kindness or amusement could restore him to his  wonted cheerfulness  mr  vincent knew that he was passionately fond of  music  and having heard him once express a wish for a tambourine  he  gave him one  but juba never played upon it  and his spirits seemed  every day to grow worse and worse  this melancholy lasted during the  whole time that he remained at harrowgate  but from the first day of his  arrival at oakly park he began to mend  after he had been there a week   he was heard to sing  and whistle  and talk as he used to do  and his  master congratulated him upon his recovery  one evening his master  asked him to go back to harrowgate for his tambourine  as little charles  percival wished to hear him play upon it  this simple request had a  wonderful effect upon poor juba  he began to tremble from head to foot   his eyes became fixed  and he stood motionless  after some time  he  suddenly clasped his hands  fell upon his knees  and exclaimed      oh  massa  juba die  if juba go back  juba die   and he wiped away the  drops that stood upon his forehead   but me will go  if massa bid  me  will die      mr  vincent began to imagine that the poor fellow was out of his senses   he assured him  with the greatest kindness  that he would almost as soon  hazard his own life as that of such a faithful  affectionate servant   but he pressed him to explain what possible danger he dreaded from  returning to harrowgate  juba was silent  as if afraid to speak   don t  fear to speak to me   said mr  vincent   i will defend you  if anybody  have injured you  or if you dread that any body will injure you  trust  to me  i will protect you       ah  massa  you no can  me die  if me go back  me no can say word more    and he put his finger upon his lips  and shook his head  mr  vincent  knew that juba was excessively superstitious  and convinced  that  if  his mind were not already deranged  it would certainly become so  were  any secret terror thus to prey upon his imagination  he assumed a  very grave countenance  and assured him  that he should be extremely  displeased if he persisted in this foolish and obstinate silence   overcome by this  juba burst into tears  and answered      den me will tell all      this conversation passed before miss portman and charles percival  who  were walking in the park with mr  vincent  at the time he met juba and  asked him to go for the tambourine  when he came to the words   me will  tell all   he made a sign that he wished to tell it to his master alone   belinda and the little boy walked on  to leave him at liberty to speak   and then  though with a sort of reluctant horror  he told that the  figure of an old woman  all in flames  had appeared to him in his  bedchamber at harrowgate every night  and that he was sure she was one  of the obeah women of his own country  who had pursued him to europe to  revenge his having once  when he was a child  trampled upon an egg shell  that contained some of her poisons  the extreme absurdity of this story  made mr  vincent burst out a laughing  but his humanity the next instant  made him serious  for the poor victim of superstitious terror  after  having revealed what  according to the belief of his country  it is  death to mention  fell senseless on the ground  when he came to himself   he calmly said  that he knew he must now die  for that the obeah women  never forgave those that talked of them or their secrets  and  with a  deep groan  he added  that he wished he might die before night  that he  might not see  her  again  it was in vain to attempt to reason him out  of the idea that he had actually seen this apparition  his account of it  was  that it first appeared to him in the coach house one night  when  he went thither in the dark  that he never afterwards went to the  coach house in the dark  but that the same figure of an old woman  all  in flames  appeared at the foot of his bed every night whilst he stayed  at harrowgate  and that he was then persuaded she would never let him  escape from her power till she had killed him  that since he had left  harrowgate  however  she had not tormented him  for he had never seen  her  and he was in hopes that she had forgiven him  but that now he was  sure of her vengeance for having spoken of her     mr  vincent knew the astonishing power which the belief in this species  of sorcery    has over the minds of the jamaica negroes  they pine  and actually die away from the moment they fancy themselves under the  malignant influence of these witches  he almost gave poor juba over for  lost  the first person that he happened to meet after his conversation  was belinda  to whom he eagerly related it  because he had observed   that she had listened with much attention and sympathy to the beginning  of the poor fellow s story  the moment that she heard of the flaming  apparition  she recollected having seen a head drawn in phosphorus   which one of the children had exhibited for her amusement  and it  occurred to her that  perhaps  some imprudent or ill natured person  might have terrified the ignorant negro by similar means  when she  mentioned this to mr  vincent  he recollected the threat that had been  thrown out by mrs  freke  the day that juba had taken possession of  the disputed coach house  and from the character of this lady  belinda  judged that she would be likely to play such a trick  and to call it   as usual  fun or frolic  miss portman suggested that one of the children  should show him the phosphorus  and should draw some ludicrous figure  with it in his presence  this was done  and it had the effect that she  expected  juba  familiarized by degrees with the object of his secret  horror  and convinced that no obeah woman was exercising over him her  sorceries  recovered his health and spirits  his gratitude to miss  portman  who was the immediate cause of his cure  was as simple and  touching as it was lively and sincere  this was the circumstance which  first turned mr  vincent s attention towards belinda  upon examining the  room in which the negro used to sleep at harrowgate  the strong smell  of phosphorus was perceived  and part of the paper was burnt on the very  spot where he had always seen the figure  so that he was now perfectly  convinced that this trick had been purposely played to frighten him  in  revenge for his having kept possession of the coach house     mrs  freke  when she found herself detected  gloried in the jest  and  told the story as a good joke wherever she went  triumphing in the  notion  that it was she who had driven both  master and man  from  harrowgate     the exploit was  however  by no means agreeable in its consequences to  her friend mrs  luttridge  who was now at harrowgate  for reasons of her  own  she was very anxious to fix mr  vincent in her society  and she  was much provoked by mrs  freke s conduct  the ladies came to high words  upon the occasion  and an irreparable breach would have ensued had  not mrs  freke  in the midst of her rage  recollected mrs  luttridge s  electioneering interest  and suddenly changing her tone  she declared  that  she was really sorry to have driven mr  vincent from harrowgate   that her only intention was to get rid of his black  she would lay any  wager  that  with mrs  luttridge s assistance  they could soon get the  gentleman back again   and she proposed  as a certain method of  fixing mr  vincent in mrs  luttridge s society  to invite belinda to  harrowgate      you may be sure   said mrs  freke   that she must by this time be  cursedly tired of her visit to those stupid good people at oakly park   and never woman  wanted  an excuse to do any thing she liked  so trust  to her own ingenuity to make some decent apology to the percivals for  running away from them  as to vincent  you may be sure belinda portman  is his only inducement for staying with that precious family party  and  if we have her we have him  now we can be sure of her  for she has just  quarrelled with our dear lady delacour  i had the whole story from  my maid  who had it from champfort  lady delacour and she are at  daggers drawing  and it will be delicious to her to hear her ladyship  handsomely abused  we are the declared enemies of her enemy  so we must  be her friends  nothing unites folk so quickly and so solidly  as hatred  of some common foe      this argument could not fail to convince mrs  luttridge  and the next  day mrs  freke commenced her operations  she drove in her  unicorn  to  oakly park to pay miss portman a visit  she had no acquaintance either  with mr  percival or lady anne  and she had always treated belinda  when  she met her in town  rather cavalierly  as an humble companion of lady  delacour  but it cost mrs  freke nothing to change her tone  she was one  of those ladies who can remember or forget people  be perfectly familiar  or strangely rude  just as it suits the convenience  fashion  or humour  of the minute           chapter xvii     rights of woman       belinda was alone  and reading  when mrs  freke dashed into the room      how do  dear creature   cried she  stepping up to her  and shaking  hands with her boisterously   how do   glad to see you  faith   been  long here   tremendously hot to day      she flung herself upon the sofa beside belinda  threw her hat upon the  table  and then continued speaking      and how d ye go on here  poor child   gad  i m glad you re  alone  expected to find you encompassed by a whole host of the  righteous  give me credit for my courage in coming to deliver you out of  their hands  luttridge and i had such compassion upon you  when we heard  you were close prisoner here  i swore to set the distressed damsel free   in spite of all the dragons in christendom  so let me carry you off in  triumph in my unicorn  and leave these good people to stare when they  come home from their sober walk  and find you gone  there s nothing i  like so much as to make good people stare  i hope you re of my way o   thinking   you don t look as if you were  though  but i never mind  young ladies  looks  always give the lie to their thoughts  now we talk  o  looks  never saw you look so well in my life  as handsome as an angel   and so much the better for me  do you know  i ve a bet of twenty guineas  on your head  on your face  i mean  there s a young bride at harrowgate   lady h      they re all mad about her  the men swear she s the  handsomest woman in england  and i swear i know one ten times as  handsome  they ve dared me to make good my word  and i ve pledged myself  to produce my beauty at the next ball  and to pit her against their  belle for any money  most votes carry it  i m willing to double my  bet since i ve seen you again  come  had not we best be off  now don t  refuse me and make speeches  you know that s all nonsense  i ll take all  the blame upon myself      belinda  who had not been suffered to utter a word whilst mrs  freke ran  on in this strange manner  looked in unfeigned astonishment  but when  she found herself seized and dragged towards the door  she drew back  with a degree of gentle firmness that astonished mrs  freke  with a  smiling countenance  but a steady tone  she said   that she was sorry  mrs  freke s knight errantry should not be exerted in a better cause   for that she was neither a prisoner  nor a distressed damsel       and will you make me lose my bet   cried mrs  freke  oh  at all events   you must come to the ball   i m down for it  but i ll not press it now   because you re frightened out of your poor little wits  i see  at the  bare thoughts of doing any thing considered out of rule by these good  people  well  well  it shall be managed for you  leave that to me  i m  used to managing for cowards  pray tell me  you and lady delacour are  off  i understand   give ye joy   she and i were once great friends   that is to say  i had over her  that power which strong minds have over  weak ones   but she was too weak for me  one of those people that have  neither courage to be good  nor to be bad       the courage to be bad   said belinda   i believe  indeed  she does not  possess      mrs  freke stared   why  i heard you had quarrelled with her       if i had   said belinda   i hope that i should still do justice to her  merits  it is said that people are apt to suffer more by their friends  than their enemies  i hope that will never be the case with lady  delacour  as i confess that i have been one of her friends        gad  i like your spirit  you don t want courage  i see  to fight even  for your enemies  you are just the kind of girl i admire  i see you have  been prejudiced against me by lady delacour  but whatever stories she  may have trumped up  the truth of the matter is this  there s no living  with her  she s so jealous  so ridiculously jealous  of that lord of  hers  for whom all the time she has the impudence to pretend not to care  more than i do for the sole of my boot   said mrs  freke  striking it   with her whip   but she hasn t the courage to give him tit for tat  now  this is what i call weakness  pray  how do she and clarence hervey go on  together   are they out o  the hornbook of platonics yet       mr  hervey was not in town when i left it   said belinda      was not he   ho  ho   he s off then   ay  so i prophesied  she s not  the thing for him  he has some strength of mind  some soul  above vulgar  prejudices  so must a woman be to hold him  he was caught at first by  her grace and beauty  and that sort of stuff  but i knew it could not  last  knew she d dilly dally with clary  till he would turn upon his  heel and leave her there       i fancy that you are entirely mistaken both with respect to mr  hervey  and lady delacour   belinda very seriously began to say  but mrs  freke  interrupted her  and ran on   no  no  no  i m not mistaken  clarence has  found her out  she s a  very  woman   that  he could forgive her  and  so could i  but she s a  mere  woman  and that he can t forgive  no more  can i      there was a kind of drollery about mrs  freke  which  with some people   made the odd things she said pass for wit  humour she really possessed   and when she chose it  she could be diverting to those who like  buffoonery in women  she had set her heart upon winning belinda over to  her party  she began by flattery of her beauty  but as she saw that this  had no effect  she next tried what could be done by insinuating that she  had a high opinion of her understanding  by talking to her as an esprit  fort      for my part   said she   i own i should like a strong devil better than  a weak angel       you forget   said belinda   that it is not milton  but satan  who says          fallen spirit  to be weak is to be miserable        you read  i see   i did not know you were a reading girl  so was i  once  but i never read now  books only spoil the originality of genius   very well for those who can t think for themselves  but when one has  made up one s opinion  there is no use in reading       but to make them up   replied belinda   may it not be useful       of no use upon earth to minds of a certain class  you  who can think  for yourself  should never read       but i read that i may think for myself       only ruin your understanding  trust me  books are full of  trash  nonsense  conversation is worth all the books in the world       and is there never any nonsense in conversation       what have you here   continued mrs  freke  who did not choose to attend  to this question  exclaiming  as she reviewed each of the books on the  table in their turns  in the summary language of presumptuous  ignorance   smith s theory of moral sentiments  milk and water  moore s  travels  hasty pudding  la bruyere  nettle porridge  this is what you  were at when i came in  was it not   said she  taking up a book     in which she saw belinda s mark   against inconsistency in our  expectations  poor thing  who bored you with this task       mr  percival recommended it to me  as one of the best essays in the  english language       the devil  they seem to have put you in a course of the bitters  a  course of the woods might do your business better  do you ever  hunt   let me take you out with me some morning  you d be quite an angel  on horseback  or let me drive you out some day in my unicorn      belinda declined this invitation  and mrs  freke strode away to the  window to conceal her mortification  threw up the sash  and called out  to her groom   walk those horses about  blockhead      mr  percival and mr  vincent at this instant came into the room      hail  fellow  well met   cried mrs  freke  stretching out her hand to  mr  vincent     it has been remarked  that an antipathy subsists between creatures   who  without being the same  have yet a strong external resemblance  mr   percival saw this instinct rising in mr  vincent  and smiled      hail  fellow  well met  i say  shake hands and be friends  man  though  i m not in the habit of making apologies  if it will be any satisfaction  to you  i beg your pardon for frightening your poor devil of a black      then turning towards mr  percival  she measured him with her eye  as a  person whom she longed to attack  she thought  that if belinda s opinion  of the understanding of  these percivals  could be lowered  she should  rise in her esteem  accordingly  she determined to draw mr  percival  into an argument      i ve been talking treason  i believe  to miss portman   cried she   for  i ve been opposing some of your opinions  mr  percival       if you opposed them all  madam   said mr  percival   i should not think  it treason       vastly polite   but i think all our politeness hypocrisy  what d ye say  to that       you know that best  madam       then i ll go a step farther  for i m determined you shall contradict  me  i think all virtue is hypocrisy       i need not contradict you  madam   said mr  percival   for the terms  which you make use of contradict themselves       it is my system   pursued mrs  freke   that shame is always the cause  of the vices of women       it is sometimes the effect   said mr  percival   and  as cause and  effect are reciprocal  perhaps you may  in some instances  be right       oh  i hate qualifying arguers  plump assertion or plump denial for me   you sha n t get off so  i say shame is the cause of all women s vices       false shame  i suppose you mean   said mr  percival      mere play upon words  all shame is false shame  we should be a great  deal better without it  what say you  miss portman   silent  hey   silence that speaks       miss portman s blushes   said mr  vincent   speak  for her         against  her   said mrs  freke   women blush because they understand       and you would have them understand without blushing   said mr   percival   i grant you that nothing can be more different than innocence  and ignorance  female delicacy        this is just the way you men spoil women   cried mrs  freke   by  talking to them of the  delicacy of their sex   and such stuff  this   delicacy  enslaves the pretty delicate dears       no  it enslaves us   said mr  vincent      i hate slavery  vive la liberte   cried mrs  freke   i m a champion for  the rights of woman       i am an advocate for their happiness   said mr  percival   and for  their delicacy  as i think it conduces to their happiness       i m an enemy to their delicacy  as i am sure it conduces to their  misery       you speak from experience   said mr  percival      no  from observation  your most delicate women are always the greatest  hypocrites  and  in my opinion  no hypocrite can or ought to be happy       but you have not proved the hypocrisy   said belinda   delicacy is not   i hope  an indisputable proof of it  if you mean  false  delicacy          to cut the matter short at once   cried mrs  freke   why  when a woman  likes a man  does not she go and tell him so honestly      belinda  surprised by this question from a woman  was too much abashed  instantly to answer      because she s a hypocrite  that is and must be the answer       no   said mr  percival   because  if she be a woman of sense  she knows  that by such a step she would disgust the object of her affection       cunning   cunning   cunning   the arms of the weakest       prudence  prudence   the arms of the strongest  taking the best means  to secure our own happiness without injuring that of others is the  best proof of sense and strength of mind  whether in man or woman   fortunately for society  the same conduct in ladies which best secures  their happiness most increases ours      mrs  freke beat the devil s tattoo for some moments  and then exclaimed    you may say what you will  but the present system of society is  radically wrong   whatever is  is wrong       how would you improve the state of society   asked mr  percival   calmly      i m not tinker general to the world   said she      i m glad of it   said mr  percival   for i have heard that tinkers  often spoil more than they mend       but if you want to know   said mrs  freke   what i would do to improve  the world  i ll tell you  i d have both sexes call things by their right  names       this would doubtless be a great improvement   said mr  percival   but  you would not overturn society to attain it  would you  should we find  things much improved by tearing away what has been called the decent  drapery of life       drapery  if you ask me my opinion   cried mrs  freke   drapery  whether  wet or dry  is the most confoundedly indecent thing in the world       that depends on  public  opinion  i allow   said mr  percival   the  lacedaemonian ladies  who were veiled only by public opinion  were  better covered from profane eyes than some english ladies are in wet  drapery       i know nothing of the lacedaemonian ladies  i took my leave of them  when i was a schoolboy  girl  i should say  but pray  what o clock is it  by you  i ve sat till i m cramped all over   cried mrs  freke  getting  up and stretching herself so violently that some part of her habiliments  gave way   honi soit qui mal y pense   said she  bursting into a horse  laugh     without sharing in any degree that confusion which belinda felt for her   she strode out of the room  saying   miss portman  you understand these  things better than i do  come and set me to rights      when she was in belinda s room  she threw herself into an arm chair  and  laughed immoderately      how i have trimmed percival this morning   said she      i am glad you think so   said belinda   for i really was afraid he had  been too severe upon you       i only wish   continued mrs  freke   i only wish his wife had been by   why the devil did not she make her appearance  i suppose the prude was  afraid of my demolishing and unrigging her       there seems to have been more danger of that for you than for any body  else   said belinda  as she assisted to set mrs  freke s rigging  as she  called it  to rights      i do of all things delight in hauling good people s opinions out of  their musty drawers  and seeing how they look when they re all pulled  to pieces before their faces  pray  are those lady anne s drawers or  yours   said mrs  freke  pointing to a chest of drawers      mine       i m sorry for it  for if they were hers  to punish her for  shirking   me  by the lord  i d have every rag she has in the world out in the  middle of the floor in ten minutes  you don t know me  i m a terrible  person when provoked  stop at nothing      as mrs  freke saw no other chance left of gaining her point with  belinda  she tried what intimidating her would do      i stop at nothing   repeated she  fixing her eyes upon miss portman  to  fascinate her by terror   friend or foe  peace or war  take your choice   come to the ball at harrowgate  i win my bet  and i m your sworn friend   stay away  i lose my bet  and am your sworn enemy       it is not in my power  madam   said belinda  calmly   to comply with  your request       then you ll take the consequences   cried mrs  freke  she rushed past  her  hurried down stairs  and called out   bid my blockhead bring my  unicorn      she  her unicorn  and her blockhead  were out of sight in a few minutes     good may be drawn from evil  mrs  freke s conversation  though at the  time it confounded belinda  roused her  upon reflection  to examine by  her reason the habits and principles which guided her conduct  she had  a general feeling that they were right and necessary  but now  with the  assistance of lady anne and mr  percival  she established in her own  understanding the exact boundaries between right and wrong upon many  subjects  she felt a species of satisfaction and security  from  seeing the demonstration of those axioms of morality  in which she had  previously acquiesced  reasoning gradually became as agreeable to her as  wit  nor was her taste for wit diminished  it was only refined by this  process  she now compared and judged of the value of the different  species of this brilliant talent     mrs  freke s wit  thought she  is like a noisy squib  the momentary  terror of passengers  lady delacour s like an elegant firework  which  we crowd to see  and cannot forbear to applaud  but lady anne percival s  wit is like the refulgent moon  we         love the mild rays  and bless the useful light       miss portman   said mr  percival   are not you afraid of making an  enemy of mrs  freke  by declining her invitation to harrowgate       i think her friendship more to be dreaded than her enmity   replied  belinda      then you are not to be terrified by an obeah woman   said mr  vincent      not in the least  unless she were to come in the shape of a false  friend   said belinda      till lately   said mr  vincent   i was deceived in the character of  mrs  freke  i thought her a dashing  free spoken  free hearted sort of  eccentric person  who would make a staunch friend and a jolly companion   as a mistress  or a wife  no man of any taste could think of her   compare that woman now with one of our creole ladies       but why with a creole   said mr  percival      for the sake of contrast  in the first place  our creole women are all  softness  grace  delicacy          and indolence   said mr  percival      their indolence is but a slight  and  in my judgment  an amiable  defect  it keeps them out of mischief  and it attaches them to domestic  life  the activity of a mrs  freke would never excite their emulation   and so much the better       so much the better  no doubt   said mr  percival   but is there  no other species of activity that might excite their ambition with  propriety  without diminishing their grace  softness  or delicacy   might not they cultivate their minds  do you think ignorance  as well as  indolence  an amiable defect  essential to the female character       not essential  you do not  i hope  imagine that i am so much prejudiced  in favour of my countrywomen  that i can neither see nor feel the  superiority in  some instances  of european cultivation  i speak only in  general       and in general   said lady anne percival   does mr  vincent wish to  confine our sex to the bliss of ignorance       if it be bliss   said mr  vincent   what reason would they have for  complaint        if    said belinda   but that is a question which you have not yet  decided       and how can we decide it   said mr  vincent   the taste and feelings of  individuals must be the arbiters of their happiness       you leave reason quite out of the question  then   said mr  percival    and refer the whole to taste and feeling  so that if the most ignorant  person in the world assert that he is happier than you are  you are  bound to believe him       why should not i   said mr  vincent      because   said mr  percival   though he can judge of his own pleasures   he cannot judge of yours  his are common to both  but yours are unknown  to him  would you  at this instant  change places with that ploughman  yonder  who is whistling as he goes for want of thought  or  would you  choose to go a step higher in the bliss of ignorance  and turn savage      mr  vincent laughed  and protested that he should be very unwilling to  give up his title to civilized society  and that  instead of wishing to  have less knowledge  he regretted that he had not more   i am sensible    said he   that i have many prejudices   miss portman has made me ashamed  of some of them      there was a degree of candour in mr  vincent s manner and conversation   which interested every body in his favour  belinda amongst the rest  she  was perfectly at ease in mr  vincent s company  because she considered  him as a person who wished for her friendship  without having any design  to engage her affections  from several hints that dropped from him  from  mr  percival  and from lady anne  she was persuaded that he was attached  to some creole lady  and all that he said in favour of the elegant  softness and delicacy of his countrywomen confirmed this opinion     miss portman was not one of those young ladies who fancy that every  gentleman who converses freely with them will inevitably fall a victim  to the power of their charms  and will see in every man a lover  or  nothing           chapter xviii     a declaration        i ve found it   i ve found it  mamma   cried little charles percival   running eagerly into the room with a plant in his hand   will you send  this in your letter to helena delacour  and tell her that is the thing  that gold fishes are so fond of  and tell her that it is called lemna   and that it may be found in any ditch or pool       but how can she find ditches and pools in grosvenor square  my dear       oh  i forgot that  then will you tell her  mamma  that i will send her  a great quantity       how  my dear       i don t know  mamma  yet  but i will find out some way       would it not be as well  my dear   said his mother  smiling   to  consider how you can perform your promises before you make them       a gentleman   said mr  vincent   never makes a promise that he cannot  perform       i know that very well   said the boy  proudly   miss portman  who is  very good natured  will  i am sure  be so good  when she goes back to  lady delacour  as to carry food for the gold fishes to helena  you see  that i have found out a way to keep my promise       no  i m afraid not   said belinda   for i am not going back to lady  delacour s       then i am very glad of it   said the boy  dropping the weed  and  clapping his hands joyfully   for then i hope you will always stay here   don t you  mamma   don t  you   mr  vincent  oh   you  do  i am sure   for i heard you say so to papa the other day  but what makes you grow so  red      his mother took him by the hand  as he was going to repeat the question   and leading him out of the room  desired him to show her the place where  he found the food for the gold fishes     belinda  to mr  vincent s great relief  seemed not to take any notice of  the child s question  nor to have any sympathy in his curiosity  she was  intently copying westall s sketch of lady anne percival and her family   and she had been roused  by the first mention of helena delacour s name   to many painful and some pleasing recollections   what a charming woman   and what a charming family   said mr  vincent  as he looked at the  drawing   and how much more interesting is this picture of domestic  happiness than all the pictures of shepherds and shepherdesses  and gods  and goddesses  that ever were drawn       yes   said belinda   and how much more interesting this picture is to  us  from our knowing that it is not a fancy piece  that the happiness is  real  not imaginary  that this is the natural expression of affection in  the countenance of the mother  and that these children  who crowd round  her  are what they seem to be  the pride and pleasure of her life       there cannot   exclaimed mr  vincent  with enthusiasm   be a more  delightful picture  oh  miss portman  is it possible that you should not  feel what you can paint so well       is it possible  sir   said belinda   that you should suspect me of  such wretched hypocrisy  as to affect to admire what i am incapable of  feeling       you misunderstand  you totally misunderstand me  hypocrisy  no   there is not a woman upon earth whom i believe to be so far above all  hypocrisy  all affectation  but i imagined  i feared       as he spoke these last words he was in some confusion  and hastily  turned over the prints in a portfolio which lay upon the table   belinda s eye was caught by an engraving of lady delacour in the  character of the comic muse  mr  vincent did not know the intimacy that  had subsisted between her ladyship and miss portman  she sighed from  the recollection of clarence hervey  and of all that had passed at the  masquerade      what a contrast   said mr  vincent  placing the print of lady delacour  beside the picture of lady anne percival   what a contrast  compare  their pictures  compare their characters  compare        excuse me   interrupted belinda   lady delacour was once my friend  and  i do not like to make a comparison so much to her disadvantage  i have  never seen any woman who would not suffer by a comparison with lady anne  percival       i have been more fortunate  i  have  seen one  one equally worthy of  esteem  admiration  love      mr  vincent s voice faltered in pronouncing the word love  yet belinda   prepossessed by the idea that he was attached to some creole lady   simply answered  without looking up from her drawing   you are indeed  very fortunate  peculiarly fortunate  are the west indian ladies          west indian ladies   interrupted mr  vincent   surely  miss portman  cannot imagine that i am at this instant thinking of any west indian  lady   belinda looked up with an air of surprise   charming miss  portman   continued he   i have learnt to admire  european beauty   european excellence   i have acquired new ideas of the female  character  ideas  feelings that must henceforward render me exquisitely  happy or exquisitely miserable      miss portman had been too often called   charming   to be much startled  or delighted by the sound  the word would have passed by unnoticed  but  there was something so impassioned in mr  vincent s manner  that she  could no longer mistake it for common gallantry  and she was in evident  confusion  now for the first time the idea of mr  vincent as a lover  came into her mind  the next instant she accused herself of vanity  and  dreaded that he should read her thoughts   exquisitely miserable   said  she  in a tone of raillery   i should not suppose  from what i have seen  of mr  vincent  that any thing could make him exquisitely miserable       then you do not know my character  you do not know my heart  it is in   your  power to make me exquisitely miserable  mine is not the cold   hackneyed phrase of gallantry  but the fervid language of passion    cried he  seizing her hand     at this instant one of the children came in with some flowers to  belinda  and  glad of the interruption  she hastily put up her drawings  and left the room  observing that she should scarcely have time to dress  before dinner  however  as soon as she found herself alone  she forgot  how late it was  and though she sat down before the glass to dress   she made no progress in the business  but continued for some time  motionless  endeavouring to recollect and to understand all that had  passed  the result of her reflections was the conviction that her  partiality for clarence hervey was greater than she ever had till this  moment suspected   i have told my aunt stanhope   thought she   that the  idea of mr  hervey had no influence in my refusal of sir philip baddely   i have said that my affections are entirely at my own command  then why  do i feel this alarm at the discovery of mr  vincent s views  why do i  compare him with one whom i thought i had forgotten   and yet how are we  to judge of character  how can we form any estimate of what is amiable   of what will make us happy or miserable  but by comparison  am i to  blame for perceiving superiority  am i to blame if one person be more  agreeable  or seem to be more agreeable  than another  am i to blame if  i cannot love mr  vincent      before belinda had answered these questions to her satisfaction  the  dinner bell rang  there happened to dine this day at mr  percival s a  gentleman who had just arrived from lisbon  and the conversation turned  upon the sailors  practice of stilling the waves over the bar of lisbon  by throwing oil upon the water  charles percival s curiosity was excited  by this conversation  and he wished to see the experiment  in the  evening his father indulged his wishes  the children were delighted at  the sight  and little charles insisted upon belinda s following him to  a particular spot  where he was well convinced that she could see better  than any where else in the world   take care   cried lady anne   or you  will lead your friend into the river  charles   the boy paused  and  soon afterwards asked his father several questions about swimming and  drowning  and bringing people to life after they had been drowned    don t you remember  papa   said he    that  mr  hervey  who was almost  drowned in the serpentine river in london    belinda coloured at hearing  unexpectedly the name of the person of whom she was at that instant  thinking  and the child continued   i liked that mr  hervey very much  i  liked him from the first day i saw him  what a number of entertaining  things he told us at dinner  we used to call him the good natured  gentleman  i like him very much  i wish he was here this minute  did you  ever see him  miss portman  oh  yes  you must have seen him  for it was  he who carried helena s gold fishes to her mother  and he used often to  be at lady delacour s  was not he       yes  my dear  often       and did not you like him very much    this simple question threw  belinda into inexpressible confusion  but fortunately the crimson on  her face was seen only by lady anne percival  to belinda s great  satisfaction  mr  vincent forbore this evening any attempt to renew  the conversation of the morning  he endeavoured to mix  with his usual  animation and gaiety  in the family society  and her embarrassment was  much lessened when she heard the next day  at breakfast  that he was  gone to harrowgate  lady anne percival took notice that she was this  morning unusually sprightly     after breakfast  as they were passing through the hall to take a walk in  the park  one of the little boys stopped to look at a musical instrument  which hung up against the wall      what is this  mamma   it is not a guitar  is it       no  my dear  it is called a banjore  it is an african instrument  of  which the negroes are particularly fond  mr  vincent mentioned it the  other day to miss portman  and i believe she expressed some curiosity to  see one  juba went to work immediately to make a banjore  i find  poor  fellow  i dare say that he was very sorry to go to harrowgate  and to  leave his african guitar half finished  especially as it was intended  for an offering to miss portman  he is the most grateful  affectionate  creature i ever saw       but why  mamma   said charles percival   is mr  vincent gone away  i  am sorry he is gone  i hope he will soon come back  in the mean time  i  must run and water my carnations       his sorrow for his friend mr  vincent s departure does not seem to  affect his spirits much   said lady anne   people who expect sentiment  from children of six years old will be disappointed  and will probably  teach them affectation  surely it is much better to let their natural  affections have time to expand  if we tear the rosebud open we spoil the  flower   belinda smiled at this parable of the rosebud  which  she said   might be applied to men and women  as well as to children      and yet  upon reflection   said lady anne   the heart has nothing in  common with a rosebud  nonsensical allusions pass off very prettily  in conversation  i mean  when we converse with partial friends  but  we should reason ill  and conduct ourselves worse  if we were to trust  implicitly to poetical analogies  our affections   continued lady anne    arise from circumstances totally independent of our will       that is the very thing i meant to say   interrupted belinda  eagerly      they are excited by the agreeable or useful qualities that we discover  in things or in persons       undoubtedly   said belinda      or by those which our fancies discover   said lady anne     belinda was silent  but  after a pause  she said   that it was certainly  very dangerous  especially for women  to trust to fancy in bestowing  their affections    and yet   said lady anne   it is a danger to which  they are much exposed in society  men have it in their power to assume  the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable  and women  have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit       without ithuriel s spear  how can they distinguish the good from the  evil   said belinda   this is a common place complaint  i know  the  ready excuse that we silly young women plead  when we make mistakes  for which our friends reproach us  and for which we too often reproach  ourselves       the complaint is common place precisely because it is general and  just   replied lady anne   in the slight and frivolous intercourse   which fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who  call themselves their lovers  it is surprising that they can discover  any thing of each other s real character  indeed they seldom do  and  this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy  marriages  a woman who has an opportunity of seeing her lover in private  society  in domestic life  has infinite advantages  for if she has any  sense  and he has any sincerity  the real character of both may perhaps  be developed       true   said belinda  who now suspected that lady anne alluded to mr   vincent    and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to  decide whether the man who addressed her would suit her taste or not   so she would be inexcusable if  either from vanity or coquetry  she  disguised her real sentiments       and will miss portman  who cannot  by any one to whom she is known   be suspected of vanity or coquetry  permit me to speak to her with the  freedom of a friend      belinda  touched by the kindness of lady anne s manner  pressed her  hand  and exclaimed   yes  dear lady anne  speak to me with freedom  you  cannot do me a greater favour  no thought of my mind  no secret feeling  of my heart  shall be concealed from you       do not imagine that i wish to encroach upon the generous openness of  your temper   said lady anne   tell me when i go too far  and i will be  silent  one who  like miss portman  has lived in the world  has seen a  variety of characters  and probably has had a variety of admirers  must  have formed some determinate idea of the sort of companion that would  make her happy  if she were to marry  unless   said lady anne   she has  formed a resolution against marriage       i have formed no such resolution   said belinda   indeed  since i have  seen the happiness which you and mr  percival enjoy in your own family   i have been much more disposed to think that a union  that a union such  as yours  would increase my happiness  at the same time  my aversion to  the idea of marrying from interest  or convenience  or from any motives  but esteem and love  is increased almost to horror  o lady anne  there  is nothing that i would not do to please the friends to whom i am under  obligations  except sacrificing my peace of mind  or my integrity  the  happiness of my life  by       lady anne  in a gentle tone  assured her  that she was the last person  in the world who would press her to any union which would make her  unhappy   you perceive that mr  vincent has spoken to me of what passed  between you yesterday  you perceive that i am his friend  but do not  forget that i am also yours  if you fear  undue influence  from any of  your relations in favour of mr  vincent s large fortune   c  let his  proposal remain a secret between ourselves  till you can decide  from  farther acquaintance with him  whether it will be in your power to  return his affection       i fear  my dear lady anne   cried belinda   that it is not in my power  to return his affection       and may i ask your objections       is it not a sufficient objection  that i am persuaded i cannot love  him       no  for you may be mistaken in that persuasion  remember what we said  a little while ago  about  fancy and spontaneous affections   does mr   vincent appear to you defective in any of the qualities which you think  essential to happiness  mr  percival has known him from the time he was  a man  and can answer for his integrity and his good temper  are not  these the first points you would consider  they ought to be  i am  sure  and i believe they are  of his understanding i shall say nothing   because you have had full opportunities of judging of it from his  conversation       mr  vincent appears to have a good understanding   said belinda      then to what do you object   is there any thing disgusting to you in  his person or manners       he is very handsome  he is well bred  and his manners are unaffected    said belinda   but  do not accuse me of caprice  altogether he does not  suit my taste  and i cannot think it sufficient not to feel disgust for  a husband  though i believe this is the fashionable doctrine       it is not mine  i assure you   said lady anne   i am not one of those  who think it  safest to begin with a little aversion   but since you  acknowledge that mr  vincent possesses the essential good qualities  that entitle him to your esteem  i am satisfied  we gradually acquire  knowledge of the good qualities of those who endeavour to please us   and if they are really amiable  their persons become agreeable to us by  degrees  when we become accustomed to them       accustomed   said belinda  smiling   one does grow accustomed even to  disagreeable things certainly  but at this rate  my dear lady anne  i do  not doubt but one might grow  accustomed  to caliban       my belief in the reconciling power of custom does not go quite so far    said lady anne   it does not extend to caliban  or even to the hero of  la belle et la bete  but i do believe  that  in a mind so well regulated  as yours  esteem may certainly in time be improved into love  i will  tell mr  vincent so  my dear       no  my dear lady anne  no  you must not  indeed you must not  you have  too good an opinion of me  my mind is not so well regulated  i am much  weaker  much sillier  than you imagine  than you can conceive   said  belinda     lady anne soothed her with the most affectionate expressions  and  concluded with saying   mr  vincent has promised not to return from  harrowgate  to torment you with his addresses  if you be absolutely  determined against him  he is of too generous  and perhaps too proud  a temper  to persecute you with vain solicitations  and however mr   percival and i may wish that he could obtain such a wife  we shall have  the common  or uncommon  sense and good nature to allow our friends to  be happy their own way       you are very good  too good  but am i then to be the cause of banishing  mr  vincent from all his friends  from oakly park       will he not do what is most prudent  to avoid the charming miss  portman   said lady anne  smiling   if he must not love her  this was at  least the advice i gave him  when he consulted us yesterday evening   but i will not sign his writ of banishment lightly  nothing but the  assurance that the heart is engaged can be a sufficient cause for  despair  nothing else could  in my eyes  justify you  my dear belinda   from the charge of caprice       i can give you no such assurance  i hope  i believe   said belinda   in great confusion   and yet i would not for the world deceive you  you  have a right to my sincerity   she paused  and lady anne said with a  smile   perhaps i can spare you the trouble of telling me in words what  a blush told me  or at least made me suspect  yesterday evening  when we  were standing by the river side  when little charles asked you        yes  i remember  i saw you look at me       undesignedly  believe me       undesignedly  i am sure  but i was afraid you would think        the truth       no  but more than the truth  the truth you shall hear  and the rest i  will leave to your judgment and to your kindness      belinda gave a full account of her acquaintance with clarence hervey  of  the variations in his manner towards her  of his excellent conduct with  respect to lady delacour  of this  by the by  she spoke at large   but  she was more concise when she touched upon the state of her own heart   and her voice almost failed when she came to the history of the lock of  beautiful hair  the windsor incognita  and the picture of virginia  she  concluded by expressing her conviction of the propriety of forgetting a  man  who was in all probability attached to another  and she declared  it to be her resolution to banish him from her thoughts  lady anne said    that nothing could be more prudent or praiseworthy than forming such  a resolution  except keeping it   lady anne had a high opinion of mr   hervey  but she had no doubt  from belinda s account  and from her own  observations on mr  hervey  and from slight circumstances which had  accidentally come to mr  percival s knowledge  that he was  as belinda  suspected  attached to another person  she wished  therefore  to confirm  miss portman in this belief  and to turn her thoughts towards one who   beside being deserving of her esteem and love  felt for her the most  sincere affection  she did not  however  press the subject farther at  this time  but contented herself with requesting that belinda would take  three days  the usual time given for deliberation in fairy tales  before  she should decide against mr  vincent     the next day they went to look at a porter s lodge  which mr  percival  had just built  it was inhabited by an old man and woman  who had for  many years been industrious tenants  but who  in their old age  had been  reduced to poverty  not by imprudence  but by misfortune  lady anne was  pleased to see them comfortably settled in their new habitation   and whilst she and belinda were talking to the old couple  their  grand daughter  a pretty looking girl of about eighteen  came in with  a basket of eggs in her hand   well  lucy   said lady anne   have you  overcome your dislike to james jackson   the girl reddened  smiled  and  looked at her grand mother  who answered for her in an arch tone   oh   yes  my lady  we are not afraid of jackson  now   we are grown very  great friends  this pretty cane chair for my good man was his handiwork   and these baskets he made for me  indeed  he s a most industrious   ingenious  good natured youth  and our lucy takes no offence at his  courting her now  my lady  i can assure you  that necklace  which is  never off her neck now  he turned for her  my lady  it is a present of  his  so i tell him he need not be discouraged  though so be she did not  take to him at the first  for she s a good girl  and a sensible girl  i  say it  though she s my own  and the eyes are used to a face after a  time  and then it s nothing  they say  fancy s all in all in love  now  in my judgment  fancy s little or nothing with girls that have sense   but i beg pardon for prating at this rate  more especially when i am so  old as to have forgot all the little i ever knew about such things       but you have the best right in the world to speak about such things   and your grand daughter has the best reason in the world to listen to  you   said lady anne   because  in spite of all the crosses of fortune   you have been an excellent and happy wife  at least ever since i can  remember       and ever since i can remember  that s more  no offence to your  ladyship   said the old man  striking his crutch against the ground    ever since i can remember  she has made me the happiest man in the  whole world  in the whole parish  as every body knows  and i best of  all   cried he  with a degree of enthusiasm that lighted up his aged  countenance  and animated his feeble voice      and yet   said the honest dame   if i had followed my fancy  and taken  up with my first love  it would not ha  been with  he   lucy  i had a  sort of a fancy  since my lady s so good as to let me speak   i had a  sort of a fancy for an idle young man  but he  very luckily for me  took  it into his head to fall in love with another young woman  and then i  had leisure enough left me to think of your grandfather  who was not so  much to my taste like at first  but when i found out his goodness and  cleverness  and joined to all  his great tenderness for me  i thought  better of it  lucy  as who knows but you may do  though there shall  not be a word said on my part to press you  for poor jackson    and my  thinking better is the cause why i have been so happy ever since  and am  so still in my old age  ah  lucy  dear  what a many years that same old  age lasts  after all  but young folks  for the most part  never think  what s to come after thirty or forty at farthest  but i don t say this  for you  lucy  for you are a good girl  and a sensible girl  though my  own grand daughter  as i said before  and therefore won t be run away  with by fancy  which is soon past and gone  but make a prudent choice   that you won t never have cause to repent of  but i ll not say a word  more  i ll leave it all to yourself and james jackson       you do right   said lady anne   good morning to you  farewell  lucy   that s a pretty necklace  and is very becoming to you  fare ye well      she hurried out of the cottage with belinda  apprehensive that the  talkative old dame might weaken the effect of her good sense and  experience by a farther profusion of words      one would think   said belinda  with an ingenuous smile   that this  lesson upon the dangers of  fancy  was intended for me  at any rate  i  may turn it to my own advantage       happy those who can turn all the experience of others to their own  advantage   said lady anne   this would be a more valuable privilege  than the power of turning every thing that is touched to gold      they walked on in silence for a few minutes  and then miss portman   pursuing the train of her own thoughts  and unconscious that she had  not explained them to lady anne  abruptly exclaimed   but if i should be  entangled  so as not to be able to retract   and if it should not be  in my power to love him at last  he will think me a coquette  a jilt   perhaps  he will have reason to complain of me  if i waste his time  and  trifle with his affections  then is it not better that i should avoid   by a decided refusal  all possibility of injury to mr  vincent  and of  blame to myself       there is no danger of mr  vincent s misunderstanding or misrepresenting  you  the risk that he runs is by his voluntary choice  and i am sure  that if  after farther acquaintance with him  you find it impossible to  return his affection  he will not consider himself as ill used by your  refusal       but after a certain time  after the world suspects that two people are  engaged to each other  it is scarcely possible for the woman to recede   when they come within a certain distance  they are pressed to unite  by  the irresistible force of external circumstances  a woman is too often  reduced to this dilemma  either she must marry a man she does not love   or she must be blamed by the world  either she must sacrifice a portion  of her reputation  or the whole of her happiness       the world is indeed often too curious  and too rash in these affairs    said lady anne   a young woman is not in this respect allowed sufficient  time for freedom of deliberation  she sees  as mr  percival once said    the drawn sword of tyrant custom suspended over her head by a single  hair        and yet  notwithstanding you are so well aware of the danger  your  ladyship would expose me to it   said belinda      yes  for i think the chance of happiness  in this instance   overbalances the risk   said lady anne   as we cannot alter the common  law of custom  and as we cannot render the world less gossiping  or less  censorious  we must not expect always to avoid censure  all we can do  is  never to deserve it  and it would be absurd to enslave ourselves to  the opinion of the idle and ignorant  to a certain point  respect for  the opinion of the world is prudence  beyond that point  it is weakness   you should also consider that the  world  at oakly park and in london  are two different worlds  in london if you and mr  vincent were seen  often in each other s company  it would be immediately buzzed about that  miss portman and mr  vincent were going to be married  and if the match  did not take place  a thousand foolish stories might be told to account  for its being broken off  but here you are not surrounded by busy eyes  and busy tongues  the butchers  bakers  ploughmen  and spinsters  who  compose our world  have all affairs of their own to mind  besides  their  comments can have no very extensive circulation  they are used to see  mr  vincent continually here  and his staying with us the remainder of  the autumn will not appear to them any thing wonderful or portentous      their conversation was interrupted  mr  vincent returned to  oakly park  but upon the express condition that he should not make his  attachment public by any particular attentions  and that he should draw  no conclusions in his favour from belinda s consenting to converse with  him freely upon every common subject  to this treaty of amity lady anne  percival was guarantee           chapter xix     a wedding       belinda and mr  vincent could never agree in their definition of  the word  flattery   so that there were continual complaints on the one  hand of a breach of treaty  and  on the other  solemn protestations of  the most scrupulous adherence to his compact  however this might be   it is certain that the gentleman gained so much  either by truth or  fiction  that  in the course of some weeks  he got the lady as far as   gratitude and esteem      one evening  belinda was playing with little charles percival at  spillikins  mr  vincent  who found pleasure in every thing that amused  belinda  and mr  percival  who took an interest in every thing which  entertained his children  were looking on at this simple game      mr  percival   said belinda   condescending to look at a game of  jack straws       yes   said lady anne   for he is of dryden s opinion  that  if a straw  can be made the instrument of happiness  he is a wise man who does not  despise it       ah  miss portman  take care   cried charles  who was anxious that she  should win  though he was playing against her   take care  don t touch  that knave       i would lay a hundred guineas upon the steadiness of miss portman s  hand   cried mr  vincent      i ll lay you sixpence  though   cried charles  eagerly   that she ll  stir the king  if she touches that knave  i ll lay you a shilling       done  done   cried mr  vincent      done  done   cried the boy  stretching out his hand  but his father  caught it      softly  softly  charles   no betting  if you please  my dear  done and  done sometimes ends in  undone       it was my fault  it was i who was in the wrong   cried vincent  immediately      i am sure you are in the right  now   said mr  percival   and  what  is better than my saying so  miss portman thinks so  as her smile tells  me       you moved  miss portman   cried charles    oh  indeed  the king s head  stirred  the very instant papa spoke  i knew it was impossible that you  could get that knave clear off without shaking the king  now  papa  only  look how they were balanced       i grant you   said mr  vincent   i should have made an imprudent bet   so it is well i made none  for now i see the chances were ten to one   twenty to one  a hundred to one against me       it does not appear to me to be a matter of chance   said mr  percival    this is a game of address  not chance  and that is the reason i like  it       oh  papa  oh  miss portman  look how nicely these are balanced  there   my breath has set them in motion  look  they shake  shake  shake  like  the great rocking stones at brimham crags       that is comparing small things to great  indeed   said mr  percival      by the by   cried mr  vincent   miss portman has never seen those  wonderful rocking stones  suppose we were to ride to see them  to morrow      the proposal was warmly seconded by the children  and agreed to by every  one  it was settled  that after they had seen brimham crags they should  spend the remainder of the day at lord c     s beautiful place in the  neighbourhood     the next morning was neither too hot nor too cold  and they set out on  their little party of pleasure  the children went with their mother  to  their great delight  in the  sociable   and mr  vincent  to his great  delight  rode with belinda  when they came within sight of the crags   mr  percival  who was riding with them  exclaimed   what is that yonder   on the top of one of the great rocking stones       it looks like a statue   said vincent   it has been put up since we  were here last       i fancy it has got up of itself   said belinda   for it seems to be  getting down of itself  i think i saw it stoop  oh  i see now  it is a  man who has got up there  and he seems to have a gun in his hand  has  not he  he is going through his manual exercise for his diversion  for  the diversion of the spectators below  i perceive  there is a party of  people looking at him       him   said mr  percival      i protest it is a woman   said vincent      no  surely   said belinda   it cannot be a woman       not unless it be mrs  freke   replied mr  percival     in fact it was mrs  freke  who had been out shooting with a party of  gentlemen  and who had scrambled upon this rocking stone  on the summit  of which she went through the manual exercise at the word of command  from her officer  as they rode nearer to the scene of action  belinda  heard the shrill screams of a female voice  and they descried amongst  the gentlemen a slight figure in a riding habit      miss moreton  i suppose   said mr  vincent      poor girl  what are they doing with her   cried belinda      they seem to be forcing her up to the top of that place  where she has  no mind to go  look how mrs  freke drags her up by the arm      as they drew nearer  they heard mrs  freke laughing loud as she rocked  this frightened girl upon the top of the stone      we had better keep out of the way  i think   said belinda   for  perhaps  as she has vowed vengeance against me  she might take a fancy  to setting me upon that pinnacle of glory       she dare not   cried vincent  his eyes flashing with anger   you may  trust to us to defend you       certainly   but i will not run into danger on purpose to give you the  pleasure of defending me   said belinda  and as she spoke  she turned  her horse another way      you won t turn back  miss portman   cried vincent eagerly  laying his  hand on her bridle    good heavens  ma am  we can t run away   we came  here to look at these rocking stones   we have not half seen them  lady  anne and the children will be here immediately  you would not deprive  them of the pleasure of seeing these things       i doubt whether they would have much pleasure in seeing  some of these  things   and as to the rest  if i disappoint the children now  mr   percival will  perhaps  have the goodness to bring them some other day       certainly   said mr  percival   miss portman shows her usual prudence       the children are so good tempered  that i am sure they will forgive  me   continued belinda   and mr  vincent will be ashamed not to follow  their example  though he seems to be rather angry with me at present for  obliging him to turn back  out of the path of danger       you must not be surprised at that   said mr  percival  laughing   for  mr  vincent is a lover and a hero  you know it is a ruled case  in all  romances  that when a lover and his mistress go out riding together   some adventure must befal them  the horse must run away with the lady   and the gentleman must catch her in his arms just as her neck is about  to be broken  if the horse has been too well trained for the heroine s  purpose   some footpad  bandit fierce  or mountaineer   some jealous  rival must make his appearance quite unexpectedly at the turn of a road   and the lady must be carried off  robes flying  hair streaming  like  buerger s leonora  then her lover must come to her rescue just in the  proper moment  but if the damsel cannot conveniently be run away with   she must  as the last resource  tumble into a river to make herself  interesting  and the hero must be at least half drowned in dragging her  out  that she may be under eternal obligations to him  and at last be  forced to marry him out of pure gratitude       gratitude   interrupted mr  vincent   he is no hero  to my mind  who  would be content with gratitude  instead of love       you need not alarm yourself  miss portman does not seem inclined to  put you to the trial  you see   said mr  percival  smiling   now it  is really to be regretted  that she deprived you of an opportunity of  fighting some of the gentlemen in mrs  freke s train  or of delivering  her from the perilous height of one of those rocking stones  it would  have been a new incident in a novel       how that poor girl screamed   said belinda   was her terror real or  affected       partly real  partly affected  i fancy   said mr  percival      i pity her   said mr  vincent   for mrs  freke leads her a weary life       she is certainly to be pitied  but also to be blamed   said mr   percival   you do not know her history  miss moreton ran away from her  friends to live with this mrs  freke  who has led her into all kinds  of mischief and absurdity  the girl is weak and vain  and believes that  every thing becomes her which mrs  freke assures her is becoming  at one  time she was persuaded to go to a public ball with her arms as bare as  juno s  and her feet as naked as mad  tallien s  at another time miss  moreton  who unfortunately has never heard the greek proverb  that half  is better than the whole   was persuaded by mrs  freke to lay aside  her  half boots  and to equip herself in men s whole boots  and thus she rode  about the country  to the amazement of all the world  these are trifles   but women who love to set the world at defiance in trifles seldom  respect its opinion in matters of consequence  miss moreton s whole  boots in the morning  and her bare feet in the evening  were talked of  by every body  till she gave them more to talk of about her attachment  to a young officer  mrs  freke  whose philosophy is professedly  latitudinarian in morals  laughed at the girl s prejudice in favour of  the ceremony of marriage  so did the officer  for miss moreton had  no fortune  it is suspected that the young lady did not feel the  difficulty  which philosophers are sometimes said to find in suiting  their practice to their theory  the  unenlightened  world reprobated the  theory much  and the practice more  i am inclined  in spite of scandal   to think the poor girl was only imprudent  at all events  she repents  her folly too late  she has now no friend upon earth but mrs  freke  who  is  in fact  her worst enemy  and who tyrannizes over her without mercy   imagine what it is to be the butt of a buffoon       what a lesson to young ladies in the choice of female friends   said  belinda   but had miss moreton no relations  who could interfere to get  her out of mrs  freke s hands       her father and mother were old  and  what is more contemptible   old fashioned  she would not listen to their advice  she ran away from  them  some of her relations were  i believe  willing that she should  stay with mrs  freke  because she was a dashing  fashionable woman  and  they thought it might be what is called  an advantage  to her  she had  one relation  indeed  who was quite of a different opinion  who saw the  danger of her situation  and remonstrated in the strongest manner  but  to no purpose  this was a cousin of miss moreton s  a respectable  clergyman  mrs  freke was so much incensed by his  insolent  interference   as she was pleased to call it  that she made an effigy  of mr  moreton dressed in his canonicals  and hung the figure up as a  scarecrow in a garden close by the high road  he was so much beloved  and respected for his benevolence and unaffected piety  that mrs  freke  totally failed in her design of making him ridiculous  her scarecrow was  torn to pieces by his parishioners  and though  in the true spirit of  charity  he did all he could to moderate their indignation against  his enemy  the lady became such an object of detestation  that she was  followed with hisses and groans whenever she appeared  and she dared not  venture within ten miles of the village      mrs  freke now changed the mode of her persecution  she was acquainted  with a nobleman from whom our clergyman expected a living  and she  worked upon his lordship so successfully  that he insisted upon having  an apology made to the lady  mr  moreton had as much dignity of mind as  gentleness of character  his forbearance was that of principle  and so  was his firmness  he refused to make the concessions that were required   his noble patron bullied  though he had a large family to provide for   the clergyman would not degrade himself by any improper submission  the  incumbent died  and the living was given to a more compliant friend  so  ends the history of one of mrs  freke s numerous frolics       this was the story   said mr  vincent   which effectually changed my  opinion of her  till i heard it  i always looked upon her as one of  those thoughtless  good natured people  who  as the common saying is  do  nobody any harm but themselves       it is difficult in society   said mr  percival   especially for women   to do harm to themselves  without doing harm to others  they may begin  in frolic  but they must end in malice  they defy the world  the world  in return excommunicates them  the female outlaws become desperate  and  make it the business and pride of their lives to disturb the peace of  their sober neighbours  women who have lowered themselves in the public  opinion cannot rest without attempting to bring others to their own  level       mrs  freke  notwithstanding the blustering merriment that she affects   is obviously unhappy   said belinda   and since we cannot do her any  good  either by our blame or our pity  we had better think of something  else       scandal   said mr  vincent   does not seem to give you much pleasure   miss portman  you will be glad to hear that mrs  freke s malice against  poor mr  moreton has not ruined him  do you know mr  percival  that he  has just been presented to a good living by a generous young man  who  heard of his excellent conduct       i am extremely glad of it   said mr  percival   who is this generous  young man  i should like to be acquainted with him       so should i   said mr  vincent   he is a mr  hervey       clarence hervey  perhaps       yes  clarence was his name       no man more likely to do a generous action than clarence hervey   said  mr  percival      nobody more likely to do a generous action than mr  hervey   repeated  belinda  in rather a low tone  she could now praise clarence hervey  without blushing  and she could think even of his generosity without  partiality  though not without pleasure  by strength of mind  and  timely exertion  she had prevented her prepossession from growing into a  passion that might have made her miserable  proud of this conquest over  herself  she was now disposed to treat mr  vincent with more favour  than usual  self complacency generally puts us in good humour with our  friends     after spending some pleasant hours in lord c       s beautiful grounds   where the children explored to their satisfaction every dingle and bushy  dell  they returned home in the cool of the evening  mr  vincent thought  it the most delightful evening he had ever felt      what  as charming as a west indian evening   said mr  percival   this  is more than i expected ever to hear you acknowledge in favour of  england  do you remember how you used to rave of the climate and of the  prospects of jamaica       yes  but my taste has quite changed       i remember the time   said mr  percival   when you thought it  impossible that your taste should ever change  when you told me that  taste  whether for the beauties of animate or inanimate nature  was  immutable       you and miss portman have taught me better sense  first loves are  generally silly things   added he  colouring a little  belinda coloured  also      first loves   continued mr  percival   are not necessarily more foolish  than others  but the chances are certainly against them  from poetry or  romance  young people usually form their earlier ideas of love  before  they have actually felt the passion  and the image which they have in  their own minds of the  beau ideal  is cast upon the first objects they  afterward behold  this  if i may be allowed the expression  is cupid s  fata morgana  deluded mortals are in ecstasy whilst the illusion lasts   and in despair when it vanishes      mr  percival appeared to be unconscious that what he was saying was any  way applicable to belinda  he addressed himself to mr  vincent solely   and she listened at her ease      but   said she   do not you think that this prejudice  as i am willing  to allow it to be  in favour of first loves  may  in our sex  be  advantageous  even when a woman may be convinced  that she ought not  to indulge a  first  love  should she not be prevented by delicacy from  thinking of a second       delicacy  my dear miss portman  is a charming word  and a still more  charming thing  and mrs  freke has probably increased our affection for  it  but even delicacy  like all other virtues  must be judged of by the  test of utility  we should run into romance  and error  and misery  if  we did not constantly refer to this standard  our reasonings as to the  conduct of life  as far as moral prudence is concerned  must depend  ultimately upon facts  now  of the numbers of people in this world  how  many do you think have married their  first loves   probably not one  out of ten  then  would you have nine out of ten pine all their lives in  celibacy  or fret in matrimony  because they cannot have the persons who  first struck their  fancy        i acknowledge this would not add to the happiness of society   said  belinda      nor to its virtue   said mr  percival   i scarcely know an idea more  dangerous to domestic happiness than this belief in the unextinguishable  nature of a first flame  there are people who would persuade us that   though it may be smothered for years  it must break out at last   and blaze with destructive fury  pernicious doctrine  false as it is  pernicious   the struggles between duty and passion may be the charm of  romance  but must be the misery of real life  the woman who marries  one man  and loves another  who  in spite of all that an amiable and  estimable husband can do to win her confidence and affection  nourishes  in secret a  fatal  prepossession for her first love  may perhaps  by  the eloquence of a fine writer  be made an interesting heroine   but  would any man of sense or feeling choose to be troubled with such  a wife   would not even the idea that women admired such conduct  necessarily tend to diminish our confidence  if not in their virtue   at least in their sincerity  and would not this suspicion destroy our  happiness  husbands may sometimes have delicate feelings as well as  their wives  though they are seldom allowed to have any by these unjust  novel writers  now  could a husband who has any delicacy be content to  possess the person without the mind   the duty without the love   could  he be perfectly happy  if  in the fondest moments  he might doubt  whether he were an object of disgust or affection   whether the smiles  of apparent joy were only the efforts of a suffering martyr   thank  heaven  i am not married to one of these charming martyrs  let those  live with them who admire them  for my part  i admire and love the wife   who not only seems but is happy  as i   added mr  percival smiling    have the fond credulity to believe  if i have spoken too long or  too warmly upon the chapter of  first loves   i have at least been a  perfectly disinterested declaimer  for i can assure you  miss portman   that i do not suspect lady anne percival of sighing in secret for some  vision of perfection  any more than she suspects me of pining for the  charming lady delacour  who  perhaps  you may have heard was my  first  love   in these days  however  so few people marry with even the  pretence to love of any sort  that you will think i might have spared  this tirade  no  there are ingenuous minds which will never be enslaved  by fashion or interest  though they may be exposed to be deceived by  romance  or by the  delicacy  of their own imaginations       i hear   said belinda  smiling   i hear and understand the emphasis  with which you pronounce that word  delicacy   i see you have not  forgotten that i used it improperly half an hour ago  as you have  convinced me       happy they   said mr  percival   who can be convinced in half an hour   there are some people who cannot be convinced in a whole life  and who  end where they began  with saying   this is my opinion  i always thought  so  and always shall       mr  vincent at all times loved mr  percival  but he never felt so much  affection for him as he did this evening  and his arguments appeared to  him unanswerable  though belinda had never mentioned to mr  vincent  the name of clarence hervey till this day  and though he did not in the  least suspect from her manner that this gentleman ever possessed any  interest in her heart  yet  with her accustomed sincerity  she had  confessed to him that an impression had been made upon her mind before  she came to oakly park     after this conversation with mr  percival  mr  vincent perceived that he  gained ground more rapidly in her favour  and his company grew every day  more agreeable to her taste  he was convinced that  as he possessed her  esteem  he should in time secure her affections      in time   repeated lady anne percival   you must allow her time  or you  will spoil all      it was with some difficulty that mr  vincent restrained his impatience   even though he was persuaded of the prudence of his friend s advice   things went on in this happy  but as he thought slow  state of  progression till towards the latter end of september     one fine morning lady anne percival came into belinda s room with a  bridal favour in her hand   do you know   said she   that we are to have  a wedding to day  this favour has just been sent to my maid  lucy  the  pretty girl whom you may remember to have seen some time ago with  that prettily turned necklace  is the bride  and james jackson is the  bridegroom  mr  vincent has let them a very pretty little farm in the  neighbourhood  and  hark  there s the sound of music      they looked out of the window  and they saw a troop of villagers   gaily dressed  going to the wedding  lady anne  who was always eager to  promote innocent festivity  sent immediately to have a tent pitched  in the park  and all the rural company were invited to a dance in the  evening  it was a very cheerful spectacle  belinda heard from all sides  praises of mr  vincent s generosity  and she could not be insensible to  the simple but enthusiastic testimony which juba bore to his master s  goodness  juba had composed  in his broken dialect  a little song  in honour of his master  which he sang to his banjore with the most  touching expression of joyful gratitude  in some of the stanzas belinda  could distinguish that her own name was frequently repeated  lady anne  called him  and desired to have the words of this song  they were a  mixture of english and of his native language  they described in the  strongest manner what had been his feelings whilst he was under the  terror of mrs  freke s fiery obeah woman  then his joy on being  relieved from these horrors  with the delightful sensations of returning  health   and thence he suddenly passed to his gratitude to belinda  the  person to whom he owed his recovery  he concluded with wishing her all  sorts of happiness  and  above all  that she might be fortunate in  her love  which juba thought the highest degree of felicity  he had no  sooner finished his song  which particularly touched and pleased  miss portman  than he begged his master to offer to her the little  instrument  which he had made with much pains and ingenuity  she  accepted the banjore with a smile that enchanted mr  vincent  but at  this instant they were startled by the sound of a carriage driving  rapidly into the park  belinda looked up  and between the heads of  the dancers she just caught a glimpse of a well known livery   good  heavens   she exclaimed   lady delacour s carriage   can it be lady  delacour      the carriage stopped  and marriott hastily jumped out of it  belinda  pressed forward to meet her  poor marriott was in great agitation    oh   miss portman  my poor lady is very ill  very ill  indeed  she has sent  me for you  here s her letter  dear miss portman  i hope you won t  refuse to come  she  has  been very ill  and is very ill  but she would  be better  if she could see you again  but i ll tell every thing  ma am   when we are by ourselves  and when you have read your letter      miss portman immediately accompanied marriott towards the house  and as  they walked thither  she learned that lady delacour had applied to  the quack doctor in whom she had such implicit faith  and had in vain  endeavoured to engage him to perform for her the operation to which she  had determined to submit  he was afraid to hazard it  and he prevailed  upon her to give up the scheme  and to try some new external remedy from  which he promised wonders  no one knew what his medicines were  but they  affected her head in the most alarming manner     in her delirium she called frequently upon miss portman  sometimes  accusing her of the basest treachery  sometimes addressing her as if she  were present  and pouring forth the warmest expressions of friendship    in her lucid intervals  ma am   continued marriott   she for some weeks  scarcely ever mentioned your name  nor could bear to hear me mention  it  one day  when i was saying how much i wished that you were with her  again  she darted at me the most terrible look that ever i beheld       when i am in my grave  marriott   cried my lady   it will be time  enough for miss portman again to visit this house  and you may then  express your attachment to her with more propriety than at present    these were my lady s own words  i shall never forget them  they struck  and astonished me  ma am  so much  i stood like one stupified  and then  left the room to think them over again by myself  and make sense of  them  if i could  well  ma am  to be sure  it then struck me like a  flash of lightning  that my lady was jealous  and  begging your pardon   ma am  of you  this seemed to me the most unnatural thing in the world   considering how easy my lady had always seemed to be about my lord  but  it was now clear to me  that this was the cause of your leaving us so  suddenly  ma am  well  i was confident that mr  champfort was at the  bottom of the business from the first  and now that i knew what scent to  go upon  i went to work with fresh spirit to find him out  which was a  thing i was determined upon  and what i m determined upon  i generally  do  ma am  so i put together things about miss portman and my lord  that  had dropped at odd times from sir philip baddely s gentleman  and i   partly serious and partly flirting  which in a good cause is no sin   drew from him  for he pretends to be a little an admirer of mine  ma am   though i never gave him the smallest encouragement  all he knew or  suspected  or had heard reported  or whispered  and out it came  ma am   that mr  champfort was the original of all  and that he had told a heap  of lies about some bank notes that my lord had given you  and that you  and my lord were to be married as soon as my lady was dead  and i  don t know what  which he maliciously circulated through sir philip s  gentleman to sir philip himself  and so round again to my lady  now  sir  philip s man behaved like a gentleman upon the occasion  which i shall  ever be free to acknowledge and remember  and when i represented things  properly  and made him sensible of the mischief  which  he assured me   was done purely with an eye to serve sir philip  his master  he very  candidly offered to assist me to unmask that villain champfort  which  he could easily do with the assistance of a few bottles of claret  and  a few fair words  which  though i can t abide hypocrisy  i thought  quite allowable upon such an occasion  so  ma am  when mr  champfort was  thrown off his guard by the claret  sir philip s gentleman began to talk  of my lord and my lady  and miss portman  and he observed that my lord  and my lady were coming together more than they used to be since miss  portman left the house  to which champfort replied with an oath  like an  unmannered reprobate as he is  and in his gibberish  french and english   which i can t speak  but the sense of it was this    my lord and lady  shall never come together  if i can help it  it was to hinder this i got  miss portman banished  for my lord was quite another man after she got  miss helena into the house  and i don t doubt but he might have been  brought to leave off his burgundy  and set up for a sober  regular man   which would not suit me at all  if my lady once was to get power over  him again  i might go whistle  so  with another reprobate oath  my lord  and my lady shall never come together again whilst i live       well  ma am   continued marriott   as soon as i was in possession of  this precious speech  i carried it and a letter of sir philip baddely s  gentleman vouching it to my lady  my lady was thunderstruck  and so  vexed to have been  as she said  a dupe  that she sent for my lord  directly  and insisted upon his giving up mr  champfort  my lord  demurred  because my lady spoke so high  and said  insist   he would  have done it  i m satisfied  of his own accord with the greatest  pleasure  if my lady had not  as it were  commanded it  but he answered  at last   my lady delacour  i m not a man to be governed by a wife  i  shall keep or part with my own servants in my own house  according to my  own pleasure   and saying so  he left the room  i never saw my lady so  angry as she was at this refusal of my lord to part with him  the house  was quite in a state of distraction for some days  i never would sit  down to the same table  ma am  with mr  champfort  nor speak to him  nor  look at him  and parties ran high above and below stairs  and at last my  lady  who had been getting better  took to her bed again with a nervous  fever  which brought her almost to death s door  she having been so  much weakened before by the quack medicines and convulsions  and all  her sufferings in secret  she would not see my lord on no account  and  champfort persuaded him her illness was pretence  to bring him to her  purpose  which was the more readily believed  because nobody was ever  let into my lady s bedchamber but myself  all this time she never  mentioned your name  ma am  but once  when i was sitting by her bedside   as she was asleep  she started suddenly  and cried out   oh  my dearest  belinda  are you come back to me    she awakened herself with the start   and raising herself quite up in her bed  she pulled back the curtains   and looked all round the room  i m sure she expected to see you  and  when she found it was a dream  she gave a heavy sigh  and sank down upon  her pillow  i then could not forbear to speak  and this time my lady was  greatly touched when i mentioned your name   she shed tears  ma am  and  you know it is not a little thing that can draw tears from my lady  but  when i said something about sending for you  she answered  she was sure  you would not return to her  and that she would never condescend to  ask a favour in vain  even from you  then i replied that i was sure you  loved her still  and as well as ever  and that the proof of that was   that mrs  luttridge and mrs  freke together  by all their wiles   could not draw you over to their party at harrowgate  and that you had  affronted mrs  freke by defending her ladyship  my lady was all surprise  at this  and eagerly asked how i came to know it  now  ma am  i had it  all by a post letter from mrs  luttridge s maid  who is my cousin  and  knows every thing that s going on  my lady from this moment forward  could scarce rest an instant without wishing for you  and fretting for  you as i knew by her manner  one day my lord met me on the stairs as i  was coming down from my poor lady s room  and he asked me how she was   and why she did not send for a physician   the best physician  my lord   she could send for   said i   would be miss portman  for she ll never be  well till that good young lady comes back again  in my humble opinion        and what should prevent that good young lady from coming back again   not i  surely   rejoined my lord   for i wish she were here with all my  heart        it is not easy to suppose  my lord   said i   after all that has  passed  that the young lady would choose to return  or that my lady  would ask her  whilst mr  champfort remains paramount in the house     if that s all   cried my lord   tell your lady i ll part with champfort  upon the spot  for the rascal has just had the insolence to insist upon  it  that a pair of new boots are not too tight for me  when i said they  were  i ll show him i can be master  and will  in my own house   ma am   my heart leaped for joy within me at hearing these words  and i ran up  to my lady with them  i easily concluded in my own mind  that my lord  was glad of the pretence of the boots  to give up handsomely after his  standing out so long  to be sure  my lord s mightily jealous of being  master  and mighty fond of his own way  but i forgive him every thing  for doing as i would have him at last  and dismissing that prince of  mischief makers  mr  champfort  my lady called for her writing desk  directly  and sat up in her bed  and with her trembling hand  as you see  by the writing  ma am  wrote a letter to you as fast as ever she could   and the postchaise was ordered  i don t know what fancy seized her  but  if you remember  ma am  the hammercloth to her new carriage had orange  and black fringe at first  she would not use it  till this had been  changed to blue and white  well  ma am  she recollected this on a  sudden  as i was getting ready to come for you  and she set the servants  at work directly to take off the blue and white  and put on the black  and orange fringe again  which she said must be done before your coming   and my lady ordered her own footman to ride along with me  and i have  come post  and have travelled night and day  and will never rest till  i get back  but  ma am  i won t keep you any longer from reading your  letter  only to say  that i hope to heaven you will not refuse to return  to my poor lady  if it be only to put her mind at ease before she dies   she cannot have long to live      as marriott finished these words they reached the house  and belinda  went to her own room to read lady delacour s letter  it contained none  of her customary   eloquence du billet    no sprightly wit  no real  no  affected gaiety  her mind seemed to be exhausted by bodily suffering   and her high spirit subdued  she expressed the most poignant anguish  for having indulged such unjust suspicions and intemperate passions   she lamented having forfeited the esteem and affection of the only  real friend she had ever possessed  a friend of whose forbearance   tenderness  and fidelity  she had received such indisputable proofs   she concluded by saying   i feel my end fast approaching  and perhaps   belinda  your humanity will induce you to grant my last request  and to  let me see you once more before i die      belinda immediately decided to return to lady delacour  though it was  with real regret that she thought of leaving lady anne percival  and the  amiable and happy family to whom she had become so much attached  the  children crowded round her when they heard that she was going  and mr   vincent stood in silent sorrow  but we spare our readers this parting  scene miss portman promised to return to oakly park as soon as she  possibly could  mr  vincent anxiously requested permission to follow her  to town  but this she positively refused  and he submitted with as good  a grace as a lover can submit to any thing that crosses his passion           chapter xx     reconciliation       aware that her remaining in town at such an unusual season of the  year would appear unaccountable to her fashionable acquaintance  lady  delacour contrived for herself a characteristic excuse  she declared  that there was no possibility of finding pleasure in any thing but  novelty  and that the greatest novelty to her would be to remain a whole  summer in town  most of her friends  amongst whom she had successfully  established a character for caprice  were satisfied that this was merely  some new whim  practised to signalize herself by singularity  the real  reason that detained her was her dependence upon the empiric  who  had repeatedly visited and constantly prescribed for her  convinced   however  by the dreadful situation to which his prescriptions had lately  reduced her that he was unworthy of her confidence  she determined to  dismiss him  but she could not do this  as she had a considerable sum to  pay him  till marriott s return  because she could not trust any one but  marriott to let him up the private staircase into the boudoir     during marriott s absence  her ladyship suffered no one to attend her  but a maid who was remarkable for her stupidity  she thought that she  could have nothing to fear from this girl s spirit of inquiry  for never  was any human being so destitute of curiosity  it was about noon when  belinda and marriott arrived  lady delacour  who had passed a restless  night  was asleep  when she awoke  she found marriott standing beside  her bed      then it is all in vain  i see   cried her ladyship   miss portman is  not with you   give me my laudanum       miss portman is come  my lady   said marriott   she is in the  dressing room  she would not come in here with me  lest she should  startle you       belinda is come  do you say  admirable belinda   cried lady delacour   and she clasped her hands with ecstasy      shall i tell her  my lady  that you are awake       yes  no  stay  lord delacour is at home  i will get up immediately   let my lord be told that i wish to speak with him  that i beg he will  breakfast with me in my dressing room half an hour hence  i will dress  immediately      marriott in vain represented that she ought not to hurry herself in  her present weak state  intent upon her own thoughts  she listened to  nothing that was said  but frequently urged marriott to be expeditious   she put on an unusual quantity of rouge  then looking at herself in the  glass  she said  with a forced smile   marriott  i look so charmingly   that miss portman  perhaps  will be of lord delacour s opinion  and  think that nothing is the matter with me  ah  no  she has been behind  the scenes  she knows the truth too well   marriott  pray did she  ask you many questions about me   was not she very sorry to leave  oakly park   were not they all extremely concerned to part with  her   did she ask after helena   did you tell her that i insisted upon  my lord s parting with champfort      at the word champfort  marriott s mouth opened eagerly  and she began to  answer with her usual volubility  lady delacour waited not for any reply  to the various questions which  in the hurry of her mind  she had  asked  but  passing swiftly by marriott  she threw open the door of her  dressing room  at the sight of belinda she stopped short  and  totally  overpowered  she would have sunk upon the floor  had not miss portman  caught her in her arms  and supported her to a sofa  when she came to  herself  and heard the soothing tone of belinda s voice  she looked up  timidly in her face for a few moments without being able to speak      and are you really here once more  my dear belinda   cried she at last    and may i still call you my friend   and do you forgive me   yes   i  see  you do  and from you i can endure the humiliation of being  forgiven  enjoy the noble sense of your own superiority       my dear lady delacour   said belinda   you see all this in too strong a  light  you have done me no injury  i have nothing to forgive       i  cannot  see it in too strong a light   nothing to forgive   yes  you  have  that which it is the most difficult to forgive  injustice  oh  how  you must have despised me for the folly  the meanness of my suspicions   of all tempers that which appears to me  and i am sure to you  the most  despicable  the most intolerable  is a suspicious temper  mine was once  open  generous as your own  you see how the best dispositions may be  depraved  what am i now  fit only         to point a moral  or adorn a tale       a mismatched  misplaced  miserable  perverted being       and now you have abused yourself till you are breathless  i may have  some chance   said belinda   of being heard in your defence  i perfectly  agree with you in thinking that a suspicious temper is despicable and  intolerable  but there is a vast difference between an acute fit of  jealousy  as our friend dr  x     would say  and a chronic habit  of suspicion  the noblest natures may be worked up to suspicion by  designing villany  and then a handkerchief  or a hammercloth   trifles  as light as air         oh  my dear  you are too good  but my folly admits of no excuse  no  palliation   interrupted lady delacour   mine was jealousy without  love       that indeed would admit of no excuse   said belinda   therefore you  will pardon me if i think it incredible  especially as i have detected  you in feeling something like affection for your little daughter  after  you had done your best  i mean your worst  to make me believe that you  were a monster of a mother       that was quite another affair  my dear  i did not know helena was worth  loving  i did not imagine my little daughter could love me  when i found  my mistake  i changed my tone  but there is no hope of mistake with my  poor husband  your own sense must show you  that lord delacour is not a  man to beloved       that could not  always  have been your ladyship s opinion   said  belinda  with an arch smile      lord  my dear   said lady delacour  a little embarrassed   in the  highest paroxysm of my madness  i never suspected that you could  love   lord delacour  i surely only hinted that you were in love with his  coronet  that was absurd enough in all conscience  don t make me more  absurd than i am       is it then the height of absurdity to love a husband       love  nonsense   impossible   hush  here he comes  with his odious  creaking shoes  what man can ever expect to be loved who wears creaking  shoes   pursued her ladyship  as lord delacour entered the room   his shoes creaking at every step  and assuming an air of levity  she  welcomed him as a stranger to her dressing room   no speeches  my lord   no speeches  i beseech you   cried she  as he was beginning to speak to  miss portman   believe me  that explanations always make bad worse  miss  portman is here  thank heaven  and her  and champfort is gone  thank  you  or your boots  and now let us sit down to breakfast  and forget as  soon as possible every thing that is disagreeable      when lady delacour had a mind to banish painful recollections  it was  scarcely possible to resist the magical influence of her conversation  and manners  yet her lord s features never relaxed to a smile during  this breakfast  he maintained an obstinate silence  and a profound  solemnity  till at last  rising from table  he turned to miss portman   and said   of all the caprices of fine ladies  that which surprises me  the most is the whim of keeping their beds without being sick  now  miss  portman  you would hardly suppose that my lady delacour  who has been so  lively this morning  has kept her bed  as i am informed  a fortnight  is  not this astonishing       prodigiously astonishing  that my lord delacour  like all the rest of  the world  should be liable to be deceived by appearances   cried her  ladyship   honour me with your attention for a few minutes  my lord  and  perhaps i may increase your astonishment      his lordship  struck by the sudden change of her voice from gaiety  to gravity  fixed his eyes upon her and returned to his seat  she  paused  then addressing herself to belinda   my incomparable friend    said she   i will now give you a convincing proof of the unlimited power  you have over my mind  my lord  miss portman has persuaded me to the  step which i am now going to take  she has prevailed upon me to make a  decisive trial of your prudence and kindness  she has determined me to  throw myself on your mercy       mercy   repeated lord delacour  and a confused idea  that she was  now about to make a confession of the justice of some of his former  suspicions  took possession of his mind  he looked aghast      i am going  my lord  to confide to you a secret of the utmost  importance  a secret which is known to but three people in the  world  miss portman  marriott  and a man whose name i cannot reveal to  you       stop  lady delacour   cried his lordship  with a degree of emotion and  energy which he had never shown till now   stop  i conjure  i command  you  madam  i am not sufficiently master of myself  i once loved you  too well to hear such a stroke  trust me with no such secret  say no  more  you have said enough  too much  i forgive you  that is all i can  do  but we must part  lady delacour   said he  breaking from her with  agony expressed in his countenance      the man has a heart  a soul  i protest  you knew him better than i did   miss portman  nay  you are not gone yet  my lord  you really love me  i  find       no  no  no   cried he  vehemently   weak as you take me to be  lady  delacour  i am incapable of loving a woman who has disgraced me   disgraced herself  her family  her station  her high endowments  her     his utterance failed      oh  lady delacour   cried belinda   how can you trifle in this manner       i meant not   said her ladyship   to trifle  i am satisfied  my lord   it is time that you should be satisfied  i  can  give you the most  irrefragable proof  that whatever may have been the apparent levity of  my conduct  you have had no serious cause for jealousy  but the proof  will shock  disgust you  have you courage to know more   then follow  me      he followed her   belinda heard the boudoir door unlocked   in a few  minutes they returned   grief  and horror  and pity  were painted in  lord delacour s countenance  as he passed hastily through the room      my dearest friend  i have taken your advice  would to heaven i had  taken it sooner   said lady delacour to miss portman   i have revealed  to lord delacour my real situation  poor man  he was shocked beyond  expression  he behaved incomparably well  i am convinced that he would   as he said  let his hand be cut off to save my life  the moment his  foolish jealousy was extinguished  his love for me revived in full  force  would you believe it  he has promised me to break with odious  mrs  luttridge  upon my charging him to keep my secret from her  he  instantly  in the handsomest manner in the world  declared he would  never see her more  rather than give me a moment s uneasiness  how i  reproach myself for having been for years the torment of this man s  life       you may do better than reproach yourself  my dear lady delacour   said  belinda   you may yet live for years to be the blessing and pride of his  life  i am persuaded that nothing but your despair of obtaining domestic  happiness has so long enslaved you to dissipation  and now that you find  a friend in your husband  now that you know the affectionate temper of  your little helena  you will have fresh views and fresh hopes  you will  have the courage to live for yourself  and not for what is called the  world       the world   cried lady delacour  with a tone of disdain   how long has  that word enslaved a soul formed for higher purposes   she paused  and  looked up towards heaven with an expression of fervent devotion  which  belinda had once  and but once  before seen in her countenance  then   as if forgetful even that belinda was present  she threw herself upon  a sofa  and fell  or seemed to fall  into a profound reverie  she  was roused by the entrance of marriott  who came into the room to ask  whether she would now take her laudanum   i thought i had taken it    said she in a feeble voice  and as she raised her eyes and saw belinda   she added  with a faint smile   miss portman  i believe  has been  laudanum to me this morning  but even that will not do long  you see   nothing will do for me now but  this    and she stretched out her hand  for the laudanum   is not it shocking to think   continued she  after  she had swallowed it   that in laudanum alone i find the means of  supporting existence      she put her hand to her head  as if partly conscious of the confusion of  her own ideas  and ashamed that belinda should witness it  she desired  marriott to assist her to rise  and to support her to her bedchamber   she made a sign to miss portman not to follow her   do not take it  unkindly  but i am quite exhausted  and wish to be alone  for i am grown  fond of being alone some hours in the day  and perhaps i shall sleep      marriott came out of her lady s room about a quarter of an hour  afterward  and said that her lady seemed disposed to sleep  but that she  desired to have her hook left by her bedside  marriott searched among  several which lay upon the table  for one in which a mark was put   belinda looked over them along with marriott  and she was surprised to  find that they had almost all methodistical titles  lady delacour s mark  was in the middle of wesley s admonitions  several pages in other  books of the same description miss portman found marked in pencil  with  reiterated lines  which she knew to be her ladyship s customary mode of  distinguishing passages that she particularly liked  some were highly  oratorical  but most of them were of a mystical cast  and appeared  to belinda scarcely intelligible  she had reason to be astonished  at meeting with such books in the dressing room of a woman of lady  delacour s character  during the solitude of her illness  her ladyship  had first begun to think seriously on religious subjects  and the  early impressions that had been made on her mind in her childhood  by a  methodistical mother  recurred  her understanding  weakened perhaps by  disease  and never accustomed to reason  was incapable of distinguishing  between truth and error  and her temper  naturally enthusiastic  hurried  her from one extreme to the other  from thoughtless scepticism to  visionary credulity  her devotion was by no means steady or permanent   it came on by fits usually at the time when the effect of opium was  exhausted  or before a fresh dose began to operate  in these intervals  she was low spirited  bitter reflections on the manner in which she had  thrown away her talents and her life obtruded themselves  the idea of  the untimely death of colonel lawless  of which she reproached herself  as the cause  returned  and her mind  from being a prey to remorse   began to sink in these desponding moments under the most dreadful  superstitious terrors  terrors the more powerful as they were secret   whilst the stimulus of laudanum lasted  the train of her ideas always  changed  and she was amazed at the weak fears and strange notions by  which she had been disturbed  yet it was not in her power entirely  to chase away these visions of the night  and they gained gradually a  dominion over her  of which she was heartily ashamed  she resolved to  conceal this  weakness   as in her gayer moments she thought it  from  belinda  from whose superior strength of understanding she dreaded  ridicule or contempt  her experience of miss portman s gentleness  and friendship might reasonably have prevented or dispelled such  apprehensions  but lady delacour was governed by pride  by sentiment  by  whim  by enthusiasm  by passion  by any thing but reason     when she began to revive after her fit of languor  and had been  refreshed by opium and sleep  she rang for marriott  and inquired for  belinda  she was much provoked when marriott  by way of proving to her  that miss portman could not have been tired of being left alone  told  her that she had been in the dressing room  rummaging over the books       what books   cried lady delacour   i forgot that  they  were left  there  miss portman is not reading them still  i suppose  go for them   and let them be locked up in my own bookcase  and bring me the key      her ladyship appeared in good spirits when she saw belinda again  she  rallied her upon the serious studies she had chosen for her morning s  amusements   those methodistical books  with their strange quaint  titles   said she   are  however  diverting enough to those who  like  myself  can find diversion in the height of human absurdity      deceived by the levity of her manner  belinda concluded that the marks  of approbation in these books were ironical  and she thought no more  of the matter  for lady delacour suddenly gave a new turn to the  conversation by exclaiming   now we talk of the height of human  absurdity  what are we to think of clarence hervey       why should we think of him at all   said belinda      for two excellent reasons  my dear  because we cannot help it  and  because he deserves it  yes  he deserves it  believe me  if it were only  for having written these charming letters   said lady delacour  opening  a cabinet  and taking out a small packet of letters  which she put  into belinda s hands   pray  read them  you will find them amazingly  edifying  as well as entertaining  i protest i am only puzzled to  know whether i shall bind them up with sterne s sentimental journey  or fordyce s sermons for young women  here  my love  if you like  description   continued her ladyship  opening one of the letters    here is a radcliffean tour along the picturesque coasts of dorset and  devonshire  why he went this tour  unless for the pleasure and glory of  describing it  heaven knows  clouds and darkness rest over the tourist s  private history  but this  of course  renders his letters more  piquant   and interesting  all who have a just taste either for literature or for  gallantry  know how much we are indebted to the obscure for the sublime   and orators and lovers feel what felicity there is in the use of the  fine figure of suspension       very good description  indeed   said belinda  without raising her eyes  from the letter  or seeming to pay any attention to the latter part of  lady delacour s speech   very good description  certainly       well  my dear  but here is something better than  pure  description   here is sense for you  and pray mark the politeness of  addressing sense to a woman  to a woman of sense  i mean  and which  of us is not  then here is sentiment for you   continued her ladyship   spreading another letter before belinda   a story of a dorsetshire lady   who had the misfortune to be married to a man as  unlike  mr  percival   and as like lord delacour  as possible  and yet  oh  wonderful  they  make as happy a couple as one s heart could wish  now  i am truly candid  and good natured to admire this letter  for every word of it is a lesson  to me  and evidently was so intended  but i take it all in good part   because  to do clarence justice  he describes the joys of domestic  paradise in such elegant language  that he does not make me sick  in  short  my dear belinda  to finish my panegyric  as it has been said of  some other epistles  if ever there were letters calculated to make you  fall in love with the writer of them  these are they       then   said miss portman  folding up the letter which she was just  going to read   i will not run the hazard of reading them       why  my dear   said lady delacour  with a look of mingled concern   reproach  and raillery   have you actually given up my poor clarence   merely on account of this mistress in the wood  this virginia st   pierre  nonsense  begging your pardon  my dear  the man loves you  some  entanglement  some punctilio  some doubt  some delicacy  some folly   prevents him from being just at this moment  where  i confess  he ought  to be  at your feet  and you  out of patience  which a young lady ought  never to be if she can help it  will go and marry  i know you will  some  stick of a rival  purely to provoke him       if ever i marry   said belinda  with a look of proud humility   i shall  certainly marry to please myself  and not to provoke any body else  and   at all events  i hope i shall never marry  a stick        pardon me that word   said lady delacour   i am convinced you never  will  but one is apt to judge of others by one s self  i am willing to  believe that mr  vincent          mr  vincent  how did you know      exclaimed belinda      how did i know  why  my dear  do you think i am so little interested  about you  that i have not found out some of your secrets  and do  you think that marriott could refrain from telling me  in her most  triumphant tone  that  miss portman has not gone to oakly park for  nothing  that she has made a conquest of a mr  vincent  a west indian  a  ward  or lately a ward  of mr  percival s  the handsomest man that ever  was seen  and the richest   c   c   c    now simple i rejoiced at the  news  for i took it for granted you would never seriously think of  marrying the man       then why did your ladyship rejoice       why  oh  you novice at cupid s chess board  do not you see the next  move  check with your new knight  and the game is your own  now  if your  aunt stanhope saw your look at this instant  she would give you up for  ever  if she have not done that already  in plain  unmetaphorical prose   then  cannot you comprehend  my straight forward belinda  that if you  make clarence hervey heartily jealous  let the impediments to your union  be what they may  he will acknowledge himself to be heartily in love  with you  i should make no scruple of frightening him within an inch of  his life  for his good  sir philip baddely was not the man to frighten  him  but this mr  vincent  by all accounts  is just the thing       and do you imagine that i could use mr  vincent so ill   and can you  think me capable of such double dealing       oh  in love and war  you know  all stratagems are allowable  but  you take the matter so seriously  and you redden with such virtuous  indignation  that i dare not say a word more  only  may i ask  are you  absolutely engaged to mr  vincent       no  we have had the prudence to avoid all promises  all engagements       there s my good girl   cried lady delacour  kissing her   all may yet  turn out well  read those letters  take them to your room  read them   read them  and depend upon it  my dearest belinda  you are not the  sort of woman that will  that can be happy  if you make a mere match  of convenience  forgive me  i love you too well not to speak the truth   though it may offend for a moment       you do not offend  but you misunderstand me   said belinda   have  patience with me  and you shall find that i am incapable of making a  mere match of convenience      then miss portman gave lady delacour a simple but full account of all  that had passed at oakly park relative to mr  vincent  she repeated the  arguments by which lady anne percival had first prevailed upon her to  admit of mr  vincent s addresses  she said  that she had been convinced  by mr  percival  that the omnipotence of a  first love  was an idea  founded in error  and realized only in romance  and that to believe that  none could be happy in marriage  except with the first object of their  fancy or their affections  would be an error pernicious to individuals  and to society  when she detailed the arguments used by mr  percival on  this subject  lady delacour sighed  and observed that mr  percival was  certainly right  judging from  his own experience   to declaim against  the folly of  first loves    and for the same reason   added she    perhaps i may be pardoned if i retain some prejudice in their favour    she turned aside her head to hide a starting tear  and here the  conversation dropped  belinda  recollecting the circumstances of her  ladyship s early history  reproached herself for having touched on this  tender subject  yet at the same time she felt with increased force  at  this moment  the justice of mr  percival s observations  for  evidently   the hold which this prejudice had kept in lady delacour s mind had  materially injured her happiness  by making her neglect  after her  marriage  all the means of content that were in her reach  her incessant  comparisons between her  first love  and her husband excited perpetual  contempt and disgust in her mind for her wedded lord  and for many years  precluded all perception of his good qualities  all desire to live with  him upon good terms  and all idea of securing that share of domestic  happiness that was actually in her power  belinda resolved at some  future moment  whenever she could  with propriety and with effect  to  suggest these reflections to lady delacour  and in the mean time she  was determined to turn them to her own advantage  she perceived that  she should have need of all her steadiness to preserve her judgment  unbiassed by her ladyship s wit and persuasive eloquence on the one  hand  and on the other by her own high opinion of lady anne percival s  judgment  and the anxious desire she felt to secure her approbation  the  letters from clarence hervey she read at night  when she retired to her  own room  and they certainly raised not only belinda s opinion of his  talents  but her esteem for his character  she saw that he had   with great address  made use of the influence he possessed over lady  delacour  to turn her mind to every thing that could make her amiable   estimable  and happy  she saw that clarence  so far from attempting  for  the sake of his own vanity  to retain his pre eminence in her ladyship s  imagination  used on the contrary  his utmost skill  to turn the tide  of her affections toward her husband and her daughter  in one of his  letters  and but in one  he mentioned belinda  he expressed great regret  in hearing from lady delacour that her friend  miss portman  was  no longer with her  he expatiated on the inestimable advantages and  happiness of having such a friend  but this referred to lady delacour   not to himself  there was an air of much respect and some embarrassment  in all he said of belinda  but nothing like love  a few words at the end  of this paragraph were cautiously obliterated  however  and  without  any obvious link of connexion  the writer began a new sentence with a  general reflection upon the folly and imprudence of forming romantic  projects  then he enumerated some of the various schemes he had formed  in his early youth  and humorously recounted how they had failed  or how  they had been abandoned  afterward  changing his tone from playful wit  to serious philosophy  he observed the changes which these experiments  had made in his own character      my friend  dr  x       said he   divides mankind into three classes   those who learn from the experience of others  they are happy men  those  who learn from their own experience  they are wise men  and  lastly   those who learn neither from their own nor from other people s  experience  they are fools  this class is by far the largest  i am  content   continued clarence   to be in the middle class  perhaps you  will say because i cannot be in the first  however  were it in my power  to choose my own character  i should  forgive me the seeming vanity of  the speech  still be content to remain in my present station upon  this principle  the characters of those who are taught by their own  experience must be progressive in knowledge and virtue  those who learn  from the experience of others may become stationary  because they must  depend for their progress on the experiments that we brave volunteers   at whose expense they are to live and learn  are pleased to try  there  may be much safety in thus snugly fighting  or rather seeing the battle  of life  behind the broad shield of a stouter warrior  yet it seems to  me to be rather an ignominious than an enviable situation      our friend  dr  x      would laugh at my insisting upon being amongst  the class of learners by their own experience  he would ask me  whether  it be the ultimate end of my philosophy to try experiments  or to be  happy  and what answer should i make  i have none ready  common sense  stares me in the face  and my feelings  even at this instant  alas   confute my system  i shall pay too dear yet for some of my experiments    sois grand homme  et sois malheureux   is  i am afraid  the law of  nature  or rather the decree of the world  your ladyship will not read  this without a smile  for you will immediately infer  that i think  myself a great man  and as i detest hypocrisy yet more than vanity   i shall not deny the charge  at all events  i feel that i am at  present  however gaily i talk of it  in as fair a way to be unhappy for  life  as if i were  in good earnest  the greatest man in europe      your ladyship s most respectful admirer  and sincere friend      clarence hervey         p  s   is there any hope that your friend  miss portman  may spend the  winter in town      though lady delacour had been much fatigued by the exertion of her  spirits during the day  she sat up at night to write to mr  hervey  her  love and gratitude to miss portman interested her most warmly for her  happiness  and she was persuaded that the most effectual way to secure  it would be to promote her union with her  first love   lady delacour   who had also the best opinion of clarence hervey  and the most sincere  friendship for him  thought she was likewise acting highly for his  interest  and she felt that she had some merit in at once parting with  him from the train of her admirers  and urging him to become a dull   married man  besides these generous motives  she was  perhaps  a little  influenced by jealousy of the superior power which lady anne percival  had in so short a time acquired over belinda s mind   strange   thought  she   if love and i be not a match for lady anne percival and reason    to do lady delacour justice  it must be observed  that she took the  utmost care in her letter not to  commit  her friend  she wrote with all  the delicate address of which she was mistress  she began by rallying  her correspondent on his indulging himself so charmingly in  the  melancholy of genius   and she prescribed as a cure to her  malheureux  imaginaire   as she called him  those joys of domestic life which he so  well knew how to paint       precepte commence  exemple acheve    said her ladyship   you will  never see me  la femme comme il y en a peu   till i see you  le bon  mari   belinda portman has this day returned to me from oakly park   fresh  blooming  wise  and gay  as country air  flattery  philosophy   and love can make her  it seems that she has had full employment for  her head and heart  mr  percival and lady anne  by right of science  and reason  have taken possession of the head  and a mr  vincent  their  ci devant ward and declared favourite  has laid close siege to the  heart  of which he is in a fair way  i think  to take possession  by the  right of conquest  as far as i can understand  for i have not yet seen   le futur   he deserves my belinda  for besides being as handsome as any  hero of romance  ancient or modern  he has a soul in which neither  spot nor blemish can be found  except the amiable weakness of being  desperately in love  a weakness which we ladies are apt to prefer to the  most philosophic stoicism  apropos of philosophy  we may presume   that notwithstanding mr  v     is a creole  he has been bred up by his  guardian in the class of men who learn by the experience of others  as  such  according to your system  he has a right to expect to be a  happy  man   has not he  according to mrs  stanhope s system  i am sure that he  has  for his thousands and tens of thousands  as i am credibly informed   pass the comprehension of the numeration table      but these will weigh not a grain in the estimation of her truly  disinterested and noble minded niece  mrs  stanhope knows nothing of  mr  vincent s proposals  and it is well for him she does not  for her  worldly good word would mar the whole  not so as to lady anne and mr   percival s approbation  their opinion is all in all with my friend  how  they have contrived it  i know not  but they have gained over belinda s  mind a degree of power almost equal to parental authority  so you may  guess that the doubtful beam will not much longer nod from side to  side  indeed it seems to me scarcely necessary to throw in the sword of  authority to turn the scale      if you can persuade yourself to finish your picturesque tour before the  ides of the charming month of november  do  my dear clarence  make haste  and come back to us in time for belinda s wedding  and do not forget my  commission about the dorsetshire angel  bring me one in your right hand  with a gold ring upon her taper finger  so help you  cupid  or never  more expect a smile     from your sincere friend and admirer      t c h  delacour       p s  observe  my good sir  that i am not in such a desperate hurry to  congratulate you on your marriage  that i should be satisfied with an  ordinary mrs  hervey  so do not  under pretence of obliging me  or for  any other consideration  yoke yourself to some damsel that you will be  ashamed to produce  for one woman worthy to be clarence hervey s wife  i  have seen  at a moderate computation  a hundred fit to be his mistress   if he should  on this subject  mistake the  fitness of things or of  persons   he would indeed be  in a fair way to be unhappy for life       the substance of a lady s letter  it has been said  always is comprised  in the postscript        after lady delacour had finished this letter  which she had no doubt  would bring clarence immediately to town  she left it with marriott   with orders to have it sent by the next post  much fatigued  she then  retired to rest  and was not visible the next day till near dinner time   when miss portman returned the packet of mr  hervey s letters   her ladyship was dissatisfied with the measured terms of belinda s  approbation  and she said  with a sarcastic smile   so  they have made a  complete philosopher of you at oakly park  you are perfect in the first  lesson  not to admire  and is the torch of cupid to be extinguished on  the altar of reason       rather to be lighted there  if possible   said belinda  and she  endeavoured to turn the conversation to what she thought must be more  immediately interesting to lady delacour  her own health  she assured  her  with perfect truth  that she was at present more intent upon her  situation than upon cupid or his torch      i believe you  my generous belinda   said lady delacour   and for that  very reason i am interested in your affairs  i am afraid  even to the  verge of impertinence  may i ask why this  preux chevalier  of yours did  not attend you  or follow you to town       mr  vincent   he knew that i came to attend your ladyship  i told him  that you had been confined by a nervous fever  and that it would be  impossible for me to see him at present  but i promised  when you could  spare me  to return to oakly park      lady delacour sighed  and opened clarence hervey s letters one after  another  looking over them without seeming well to know what she was  about  lord delacour came into the room whilst these letters were still  in her hand  he had been absent since the preceding morning  and he now  seemed as if he were just come home  much fatigued  he began in a tone  of great anxiety to inquire after lady delacour s health  she was piqued  at his having left home at such a time  and  merely bowing her head to  him  she went on reading  his eyes glanced upon the letters which she  held in her hand  and when he saw the well known writing of clarence  hervey  his manner immediately altered  and  stammering out some  common place phrases  he threw himself into an arm chair by the  fireside  protesting that he was tired to death  that he was half  dead  that he had been in a post chaise for three hours  which he  hated  had ridden fifty miles since yesterday  and he muttered that he  was a fool for his pains  an observation which  though it reached her  ladyship s ears  she did not think proper to contradict     his lordship had then recourse to his watch  his never failing friend  in need  which he always pulled out with a particular jerk when he was  vexed      it is time for me to be gone  i shall be late at studley s       you dine with his lordship then   said lady delacour  in a careless  tone      yes  and his good burgundy  i hope  will wind me up again   said he   stretching himself   for i am quite down       quite down  then we may conclude that my friend mrs  luttridge is not  yet come to  rantipole   rantipole  my dear   continued lady delacour   turning to miss portman   is the name of harriot freke s villa in kent   however strange it may sound to your ears and mine  i can assure you  the name has  made fortune  amongst a certain description of wits  and  candour must allow that  if not elegant  it is appropriate  it gives a  just idea of the manners and way of life of the place  for every thing  at rantipole is rantipole  but i am really concerned  my lord  you  should have ridden yourself down in this way for nothing  why did not  you get better intelligence before you set out  i am afraid you feel  the loss of champfort  why did not you contrive to learn for certain  my  dear good lord  whether  the luttridge  was at rantipole  before you set  out on this wild goose chase       my dear good lady   replied lord delacour  assuming a degree of spirit  which startled her as much as it became him   why do you not get better  intelligence before you suspect me of being a brute and a liar  did not  i promise you yesterday  that i would break with  the luttridge   as you  call her  and how could you imagine that the instant afterwards  just  at the time i was wrung to the soul  as you know i was  how could you  imagine i would leave you to go to rantipole  or to any woman upon  earth       oh  my lord  i beg your pardon  i beg your pardon a thousand times    cried lady delacour  rising with much emotion  and  going towards him  with a sudden impulse  she kissed his forehead      and so you ought to beg my pardon   said lord delacour  in a faltering  voice  but without moving his posture      you will acknowledge you left me  however  my lord  that is clear       left you  yes  so i did  to ride all over the country in search of a  house that would suit you  for what else did you think i  could  leave  you at such a time as this      lady delacour again stooped  and leaned her arm upon his shoulder      i wish to heaven  my dear   said his lordship  shrinking as he put away  her hand  which still held clarence hervey s letters   i wish to heaven   my dear  you would not hold those abominable perfumed papers just under  my very nose  you know i cannot stand perfumes       are they perfumed  ay  so every thing is that i keep in that cabinet  of curiosities  thank you  my dear miss portman   said her ladyship   as belinda rose to take the letters from her hand   will you have the  goodness to put them back into their cabinet  if you can endure to touch  them  if the perfume has not overcome you as well as my lord  after all   it is only ottar of roses  to which few people s olfactory nerves have  an antipathy       i have the honour to be one of the few   said his lordship  rising  from his seat with so sudden a motion as to displace lady delacour s arm  which leaned upon him   for my part   continued he  taking down one  of the argand lamps from the chimney piece  and trimming it   i would  rather a hundred to one snuff up the oil of this cursed lamp      whilst his lordship applied himself to trimming the lamp with great  earnestness  lady delacour negligently walked away to the farthest  end of the room  where stood the cabinet  which belinda was trying to  unlock      stay  my love  it has a secret lock  which i alone can manage       oh  my dear lady delacour   whispered belinda  holding her hand as  she gave her the key   i never can love or esteem you if you use lord  delacour ill now       ill now  ill now  this lock is spoilt  i do believe   said she aloud      nay  you understand me  lady delacour  you see what is passing in his  mind       to be sure  i am not a fool  though he is  i see he is jealous  though  he has had such  damning proof  that all s right  the man s a fool   that s all  are you sure this is the key i gave you  my dear       and can you think him a fool   pursued belinda  in a still more earnest  whisper   for being more jealous of your mind than of your person  fools  have seldom so much penetration  or so much delicacy       but  lord  what would you have me do  what would you have me say  that  lord delacour writes better letters than these       oh  no  but show him these letters  and you will do justice to him  to  yourself  to cla      to every body       i am sure i should be happy to do justice to  every body        then pray do this very instant  my dearest lady delacour  and i shall  love you for it all my life       done   for who can withstand that offer   done   said her ladyship   then turning to lord delacour   my lord  will you come here and tell us  what can be the matter with this lock       if the lock be spoiled  lady delacour  you had better send for a  locksmith   replied his lordship  who was still employed about the  wick of the argand   i am no locksmith  i do not pretend to understand  locks  especially secret locks       but you will not desert us at our utmost need  i am sure  my lord    said belinda  approaching him with a conciliatory smile      you want the light  i believe  more than i do   said his lordship   advancing with the lamp to meet her   well  what is the matter with this  confounded lock of yours  lady delacour  i know i should be at studley s  by this time  but how in the devil s name can you expect me to open a  secret lock when i do not know the secret  lady delacour       then i will tell you the secret  lord delacour  that there is no secret  at all in the lock  or in the letters  here  if you can stand the odious  smell of ottar of roses  take these letters and read them  foolish man   and keep them till the shocking perfume is gone off      lord delacour could scarcely believe his senses  he looked in lady  delacour s eyes to see whether he had understood her rightly      but i am afraid   said she  smiling   that you will find the perfume  too overcoming       not half so overcoming   cried he  seizing her hand  and kissing it  often with eager tenderness   not half so overcoming as this confidence   this kindness  this condescension from you       miss portman will think us both a couple of old fools   said her  ladyship  making a slight effort to withdraw her hand   but she is  almost as great a simpleton herself  i think   continued she  observing  that the tears stood in belinda s eyes      my lord   said a footman who came in at this instant   do you dress   the carriage is at the door  as you ordered  to go to lord studley s       i d see lord studley at the devil  sir  and his burgundy along with  him  before i d go to him to day  and you may tell him so  if you  please   cried lord delacour      very well  my lord   said the footman      my lord dines at home  they may put up the carriage  that s all   said  lady delacour   only let us have dinner directly   added she  as the  servant shut the door   miss portman will be famished amongst us  there  is no living upon sentiment       and there is no living with such belles without being something more of  a beau   said lord delacour  looking at his splashed boots   i will  be ready for dinner before dinner is ready for me   with activity very  unusual to him  he hurried out of the room to change his dress      o day of wonders   exclaimed lady delacour   and  o night of wonders   if we can get him through the evening without the help of lord studley s  wine  you must give us some music  my good belinda  and make him  accompany you with his flute  i can tell you he has really a very pretty  taste for music  and knows fifty times more of the matter than half  the dilettanti  who squeeze the human face divine into all manner of  ridiculous shapes  by way of persuading you that they are in ecstasy   and  my dear  do not forget to show us the charming little portfolio of  drawings that you have brought from oakly park  lord delacour was with  me at harrowgate in the days of his courtship  he knows the charming  views that you have been taking about knaresborough and fountain s  abbey  and all those places  i will answer for it  he remembers them  a hundred times better than i do  and  my love  i assure you he is a  better judge of drawing than many whom we saw ogling venus rising from  the sea  in the orleans gallery  lord delacour has let his talents go to  sleep in a shameless manner  but really he has talents  if they could be  wakened  by the by  pray make him tell you the story of lord studley s  original titian  he tells that story with real humour  perhaps you have  not found it out  but lord delacour has a vast deal of drollery in his  own way  and          dinner s ready  my lady       that is a pity   whispered lady delacour   for if they had let me go  on in my present humour  i should have found out that my lord has every  accomplishment under the sun  and every requisite under the moon  to  make the marriage state happy      with the assistance of belinda s portfolio and her harp  and the  good humour and sprightliness of lady delacour s wit  his lordship  got through the evening much to his own satisfaction  he played on the  flute  he told the story of studley s original titian  and he detected a  fault that had escaped mr  percival in the perspective of miss portman s  sketch of fountain s abbey  the perception that his talents were  called  out   and that he appeared to unusual advantage  made him  excellent  company   he found that the spirits can be raised by self complacency  even more agreeably than by burgundy           chapter xxi     helena      whilst they were at breakfast the next morning in lady delacour s  dressing room  marriott knocked at the door  and immediately opening  it  exclaimed in a joyful tone   miss portman  they re eating it  ma am   they re eating it as fast as ever they can       bring them in  your lady will give you leave  marriott  i fancy   said  miss portman  marriott brought in her gold fishes  some green leaves  were floating on the top of the water in the glass globe      see  my lady   said she   what miss portman has been so good as to  bring from oakly park for my poor gold fishes  who  i am sure  ought  to be much obliged to her  as well as myself   marriott set the globe  beside her lady  and retired      from oakly park  and by what name impossible to pronounce must i call  these green leaves  to please botanic ears   said lady delacour      this   replied belinda   is what         th unlearned  duckweed  learned  lemna  call     and it is to be found in any ditch or standing pool       and what possessed you  my dear  for the sake of marriott and her gold  fishes  to trouble yourself to bring such stuff a hundred and seventy  miles       to oblige little charles percival   said miss portman   he was anxious  to keep his promise of sending it to your helena  she found out in some  book that she was reading with him last summer  that gold fishes are  fond of this plant  and i wish   added belinda  in a timid voice   that  she were here at this instant to see them eat it      lady delacour was silent for some minutes  and kept her eye steadily  upon the gold fishes  at length she said   i never shall forget how  well the poor little creature behaved about those gold fishes  i  grew amazingly fond of her whilst she was with me  but you know   circumstanced as i was  after you left me  i could not have her at  home       but now i am here   said belinda   will she he any trouble to you  and  will she not make your home more agreeable to you  and to lord delacour   who was evidently very fond of her       ah  my dear   said lady delacour   you forget  and so do i at times   what i have to go through  it is in vain to talk  to think of making  home  or any place  or any thing  or any person  agreeable to me now   what am i  the outside rind is left  the sap is gone  the tree lasts  from day to day by miracle  it cannot last long  you would not wonder to  hear me talk in this way  if you knew the terrible time i had last night  after we parted  but i have these nights constantly now  let us talk of  something else  what have you there  a manuscript       yes  a little journal of edward percival s  which he sent for the  entertainment of helena      lady delacour stretched out her hand for it   the boy will write as like  his father as possible   said she  turning over the leaves   i wish  to have this poor girl with me  but i have no spirits  and you know   whenever lord delacour can find a house that will suit us  we shall  leave town  and i could not take helena with me  but this may be the  last opportunity i may ever have of seeing her  and i  can  refuse you  nothing  my dear  so will you go for her  she can stay with us a few  days  lady boucher  that most convenient dowager  who likes going about   no matter where  all the morning  will go with you to mrs  dumont s  academy in sloane street  i would as soon go to a bird fancier s as to a  boarding school for young ladies  indeed  i am not well enough to go  any where  so i will throw myself upon a sofa  and read this child s  journal  i wonder how that or any thing else can interest me now      belinda  who had been used to the variations of lady delacour s spirits   was not much alarmed by the despondent strain in which she now spoke   especially when she considered that the thoughts of the dreadful trial  this unfortunate woman was soon to go through must naturally depress  her courage  rejoiced at the permission that she had obtained to go for  helena  miss portman sent immediately to lady boucher  who took her to  sloane street      now  my dear  considerate miss portman   said lady boucher   i must  beg  and request that you will hurry miss delacour into the carriage  as fast as possible  i have not a moment to spare  for i am to be at a  china auction at two  that i would not miss for the whole world  well   what s the matter with the people  why does not james knock at the door   can t the man read  can t the man see   cried the purblind dowager   is  not that mrs  dumont s name on the door before his eyes       no  ma am  i believe this name is ellicot   said belinda      ellicot  is it  ay  true  but what s the man stopping for  then  mrs   dumont s is the next door  tell the blind dunce  mercy on us  to waste  one s time in this way  i shall  as sure as fate  be too late for the  china auction  what upon earth stops us       nothing but a little covered cart  which stands at mrs  dumont s door   there  now it is going  an old man is drawing it out of the way as fast  as he can       open the coach door  james   cried lady boucher the moment that they  had drawn up   now  my dear  considerate miss portman  remember the  auction  and don t let miss delacour stay to change her dress or any  thing      belinda promised not to detain her ladyship a minute  the door at mrs   dumont s was open  and a servant was assisting an old man to carry in  some geraniums and balsams out of the covered cart which had stopped the  way  in the hall a crowd of children were gathered round a high stand   on which they were eagerly arranging their flower pots  and the busy hum  of voices was so loud  that when miss portman first went in  she could  neither hear the servant  nor make him hear her name  nothing was to be  heard but  oh  how beautiful  oh  how sweet  that s mine  that s yours   the great rose geranium for miss jefferson  the white provence rose for  miss adderly  no  indeed  miss pococke  that s for miss delacour  the  old man said so        silence  silence  mesdemoiselles    cried the voice of a french woman   and all was silence  the little crowd looked towards the hall door   and from the midst of her companions  helena delacour  who now caught  a glimpse of belinda  sprang forward  throwing down her white provence  rose as she passed      lady boucher s compliments  ma am   said the servant to mrs  dumont    she s in indispensable haste  and she begs you won t let miss delacour  think of changing her dress      it was the last thing of which miss delacour was likely to think at this  instant  she was so much overjoyed  when she heard that belinda was come  by her mamma s desire to take her home  that she would scarcely stay  whilst mrs  dumont was tying on her straw hat  and exhorting her to let  lady delacour know how it happened that she was  so far from fit to be  seen       yes  ma am  yes  ma am  i ll remember  i ll be sure to remember   said  helena  tripping down the steps  but just as she was getting into the  carriage she stopped at the sight of the old man  and exclaimed   oh   good old man  i must not forget you       yes  indeed  you must  though  my dear miss delacour   said lady  boucher  pulling her into the carriage    tis no time to think of good  old men now       but i must  dear miss portman  will you speak for me  i must pay  i  must settle  and i have a great deal to say      miss portman desired the old man to call in berkley square at lady  delacour s  and this satisfying all parties  they drove away     when they arrived in berkley square  marriott told them that her lady  was just gone to lie down  edward percival s little journal  which she  had been reading  was left on the sofa  and belinda gave it to helena   who eagerly began to look over it      thirteen pages  oh  how good he has been to write so much for me   said  she  and she had almost finished reading it before her mother came into  the room     lady delacour shrunk back as her daughter ran towards her  for she  recollected too well the agony she had once suffered from an embrace of  helena s  the little girl appeared more grieved than surprised at this   and after kissing her mother s hand  without speaking  she again looked  down at the manuscript      does that engross your attention so entirely  my dear   said lady  delacour   that you can neither spare one word nor one look for your  mother       oh  mamma  i only tried to read  because i thought you were angry with  me       an odd reason for trying to read  my dear   said lady delacour with a  smile   have you any better reason for thinking i was angry with you       ah  i know you are not angry now  for you smile   said helena   but  i thought at first that you were  mamma  because you gave me only your  hand to kiss       only my hand  the next time  simpleton  i ll give you only my foot  to kiss   said her ladyship  sitting down  and holding out her foot  playfully     her daughter threw aside the book  and kneeling down kissed her foot   saying  in a low voice   dear mamma  i never was so happy in my life   for you never looked so very   very  kindly at me before       do not judge always of the kindness people feel for you  child  by  their looks  and remember that it is  possible  a person might have felt  more than you could guess by their looks  pray now  helena  you are such  a good judge of physiognomy  should you guess that i was dying  by my  looks      the little girl laughed  and repeated  dying  oh  no  mamma       oh  no  because i have such a fine colour in my cheeks  hey       not for that reason  mamma   said helena  withdrawing her eyes from her  mother s face      what  then you know rouge already when you see it   you perceive some  difference  for instance  between miss portman s colour and mine  upon  my word  you are a nice observer  such nice observers are sometimes  dangerous to have near one       i hope  mother   said helena   that you do not think i would try to  find out any thing that you wish  or that i imagined you wished  i  should not know       i do not understand you  child   cried lady delacour  raising herself  suddenly upon the sofa  and looking full in her daughter s face     helena s colour rose to her temples  but  with a firmness that surprised  even belinda  she repeated what she had said nearly in the same words      do you understand her  miss portman   said lady delacour      she expresses  i think   said belinda   a very honourable sentiment   and one that is easily understood       ay  in general  certainly   said lady delacour  checking herself   but  i thought that she meant to allude to something in particular   that   was what i did not understand  undoubtedly  my dear  you have just  expressed a very honourable sentiment  and one that i should scarcely  have expected from a child of your age      helena  my dear   said her mother  after a silence of some minutes    did you ever read the arabian tales    yes  mamma   i know must be the  answer  but do you remember the story of zobeide  who carried the porter  home with her on condition that  let him hear or see what he might  he  would ask no questions       yes  mamma       on the same conditions should you like to stay with me for a few days       yes  on any conditions  mamma  i should like to stay with you       agreed  then  my dear   said lady delacour   now let us go to the gold  fishes  and see them eat lemna  or whatever you please to call it      while they were looking at the gold fishes  the old man  who had been  desired by miss portman to call  arrived   who is this fine  gray haired  old man   said lady delacour  helena  who did not know the share which  belinda s aunt and her own mother had in the transaction  began with  great eagerness to tell the history of the poor gardener  who had been  cheated by some fine ladies out of his aloe   c  she then related how  kind lady anne percival and her aunt margaret had been to him  that  they had gotten him a place as a gardener at twickenham  and that he  had pleased the family to whom he was recommended so much by his good  behaviour  that  as they were leaving their house  and obliged to part  with him  they had given him all the geraniums and balsams out of the  green house of which he had the care  and these he had been this day  selling to the young ladies at mrs  dumont s   i received the money for  him  and i was just going to pay him   said helena   when miss portman  came  and that put every thing else out of my head  may i go and give  him his money now  mamma       he can wait a few minutes   said lady delacour  who had listened to  this story with much embarrassment and impatience   before you go   helena  favour us with the names of  the fine ladies who cheated  this  old gardener out of his aloe       indeed  mamma  i don t know their names       no   did you never ask lady anne percival  or your aunt margaret   look  in my face  child  did they never inform you       no  ma am  never  i once asked lady anne  and she said that she did not  choose to tell me  that it would be of no use to me to know       i give lady anne percival more credit and more thanks for this   cried  lady delacour   than for all the rest  i see she has not attempted to  lower me in my child s opinion  i am the fine lady  helena  i was  the cause of his being cheated  i was intent upon  the noble end  of  outshining a certain mrs  luttridge  the  noble means  i left to others   and the means have proved worthy of the end  i deserve to be brought  to shame for my folly  yet my being ashamed will do nobody any good but  myself  restitution is in these cases the best proof of repentance  go   helena  my love  settle your little affairs with this old man  and bid  him call here again to morrow  i will see what we can do for him      lord delacour had this very morning sent home to her ladyship a handsome  diamond ring  which had been intended as a present for mrs  luttridge   and which he imagined would therefore be peculiarly acceptable to his  lady  in the evening  when his lordship asked her how she liked the  ring  which he desired the jeweller to leave for her to look at it  she  answered  that it was a handsome ring  but that she hoped he had not  purchased it for her      it is not actually bought  my dear   said his lordship   but if it  suits your fancy  i hope you will do me the honour to wear it for my  sake       i will wear it for your sake  my lord   said lady delacour   if you  desire it  and as a mark of your regard it is agreeable  but as to the  rest           my taste for diamonds now is o er       the sparkling baubles please no more      if you wish to do me a kindness  i will tell you what i should like much  better than diamonds  though i know it is rather ungracious to dictate  the form and fashion of a favour  but as my dictatorship in all human  probability cannot last much longer        oh  my dear lady delacour  i must not hear you talk in this manner   your dictatorship  as you call it  will i hope last many  many happy  years  but to the point  what should you like better  my dear  than this  foolish ring      her ladyship then expressed her wish that a small annuity might be  settled upon a poor old man  whom she said she had unwittingly injured   she told the story of the rival galas and the aloe  and concluded by  observing  that her lord was in some measure called upon to remedy  part of the unnumbered ills which had sprung from her hatred of mrs   luttridge  as he had originally been the cause of her unextinguishable  ire  lord delacour was flattered by this hint  and the annuity was  immediately promised to the old gardener     in talking to this old man afterward  lady delacour found  that the  family in whose service he lately lived had a house at twickenham that  would just answer her purpose  lord delacour s inquiries had hitherto  been unsuccessful  he was rejoiced to find what he wanted just as he  was giving up the search  the house was taken  and the old man hired  as gardener  a circumstance which seemed to give him almost as much  pleasure as the annuity  for there was a morello cherry tree in the  garden which had succeeded the aloe in his affection   it would have  grieved him sorely   he said   to leave his favourite tree to strangers   after all the pains he had been at  in netting  it to keep off the  birds      as the period approached when her fate was to be decided  lady  delacour s courage seemed to rise  and at the same time her anxiety   that her secret should not be discovered  appeared to increase      if i survive  this business    said she   it is my firm intention to  appear in a new character  or rather to assert my real character  i will  break through the spell of dissipation  i will at once cast off all the  acquaintance that are unworthy of me  i will  in one word  go with you   my dear belinda  to mr  percival s  i can bear to be mortified for my  good  and i am willing  since i find that lady anne percival has behaved  generously to me  with regard to helena s affections  i am willing that  the recovery of my moral health should be attributed to the salubrious  air of oakly park  but it would be inexpressible  intolerable  mortification to me  to have it said or suspected in the world of  fashion  that i retreated from the ranks disabled instead of disgusted   a voluntary retirement is graceful and dignified  a forced retreat is  awkward and humiliating  you must be sensible that i could not endure to  have it whispered   lady delacour now sets up for being a prude  because  she can no longer be a coquette   lady delacour would become the subject  of witticisms  epigrams  caricatures without end  it would just be the  very thing for mrs  luttridge  then she would revenge herself without  mercy for  the ass and her panniers   we should have  lord and lady  d      or the domestic tete a tete   or  the reformed amazon   stuck  up in a print shop window  oh  my dear  think of seeing such a thing  i  should die with vexation  and of all deaths  that is the death i should  like the least      though belinda could not entirely enter into those feelings  which  thus made lady delacour invent wit against herself  and anticipate  caricatures  yet she did every thing in her power to calm her ladyship s  apprehension of a discovery      my dear   said lady delacour   i have perfect confidence in lord  delacour s promise  and in his good nature  of which he has within these  few days given me proofs that are not lost upon my heart  but he is not  the most discreet man in the world  whenever he is anxious about any  thing  you may read it a mile off in his eyes  nose  mouth  and chin   and to tell you all my fears in one word  marriott informed me this  morning  that  the luttridge   who came from harrowgate to rantipole   to meet lord delacour  finding that there was no drawing him to her  has  actually brought herself to town      to town   at this strange time of year  how will my lord resist this  unequivocal  unprecedented proof of passion  if she catch hold of him  again  i am undone  or  even suppose him firm as a rock  her surprise   her jealousy  her curiosity  will set all engines at work  to find out  by what witchcraft i have taken my husband from her  every precaution  that prudence could devise against her malicious curiosity i have taken   marriott  you know  is above all temptation  that vile wretch  naming  the person whose quack medicines had nearly destroyed her   that vile  wretch will be silent from fear  for his own sake  he is yet to be paid  and dismissed  that should have been done long ago  but i had not money  both for him and mrs  franks the milliner  she is now paid  and lord  delacour  i am glad to tell his friend how well he deserves her good  opinion  lord delacour in the handsomest manner supplied me with the  means of satisfying this man  he is to be here at three o clock to day   and this is the last interview he will ever have with lady delacour in   the mysterious boudoir       the fears which her ladyship expressed of mrs  luttridge s malicious  curiosity were not totally without foundation  champfort was at work for  her and for himself  the memorable night of lady delacour s overturn   and the bustle that marriott made about the key of the boudoir  were  still fresh in his memory  and he was in hopes that  if he could  discover the mystery  he should at once regain his power over lord  delacour  reinstate himself in his lucrative place  and obtain a  handsome reward  or  more properly speaking  bribe  from mrs  luttridge   the means of obtaining information of all that passed in lady delacour s  family were  he thought  still in his power  though he was no longer  an inmate of the house  the  stupid maid  was not so stupid as to be  impenetrable to the voice of flattery  or  as mr  champfort called  it  the voice of love  he found it his interest to court  and she her  pleasure to be courted  on these  coquettes of the  second  table    on these underplots in the drama  much of the comedy  and some of the  tragedy  of life depend  under the unsuspected mask of stupidity this  worthy mistress of our intriguing valet de chambre concealed the quick  ears of a listener  and the demure eyes of a spy  long  however  did she  listen  and long did she spy in vain  till at last mr  champfort gave  her notice in writing that his love would not last another week  unless  she could within that time contrive to satisfy his curiosity  and that   in short  she  must  find out the reason why the boudoir was always  locked  and why mrs  marriott alone was to be trusted with the key  now  it happened that this billet doux was received on the very day appointed  for lady delacour s last interview with the quack surgeon in the  mysterious boudoir  marriott  as it was her custom upon such occasions   let the surgeon in  and showed him up the back stairs into the boudoir   locked the door  and bade him wait there till her lady came  the man had  not been punctual to the hour appointed  and lady delacour  giving up  all expectation of his coming till the next day  had retired to her  bedchamber  where she of late usually at this hour secluded herself to  read methodistical books  or to sleep  marriott  when she went up to  let her lady know that  the person   as she always called him  was come   found her so fast asleep that she thought it a pity to waken her  as she  had not slept at all the preceding night  she shut the door very softly   and left her lady to repose  at the bottom of the stairs she was met by   the stupid maid   whom she immediately despatched with orders to wash  some lace   your lady s asleep   said she   and pray let me have no  running up and down stairs   the room into which the stupid maid went  was directly underneath the boudoir  and whilst she was there she  thought that she heard the steps of a man s foot walking over head  she  listened more attentively  she heard them again  she armed herself  with a glass of jelly in her hand   for my lady   and hurried up stairs  instantly to  my lady s  room  she was much surprised to see my lady  fast asleep  her astonishment at finding that mrs  marriott had told her  the truth was such  as for a moment to bereave her of all presence of  mind  and she stood with the door ajar in her hand  as thus she stood  she was roused by the sound of some one clearing his throat very softly  in the boudoir   his  throat  for she recollected the footsteps she  had heard before  and she was convinced it could be no other than a  masculine throat  she listened again  and stooped down to try whether  any feet could be seen under the door  as she was in this attitude  her  lady suddenly turned on her bed  and the book which she had been reading  fell from the pillow to the floor with a noise  that made the listener  start up instantaneously in great terror  the noise  however  did not  waken lady delacour  who was in that dead sleep which is sometimes the  effect of opium  the noise was louder than what could have been made by  the fall of a book alone  and the girl descried a key that had fallen  along with the book  it occurred to her that this might possibly be the  key of the boudoir  from one of those irresistible impulses which some  people make an excuse for doing whatever they please  she seized it   resolved at all hazards to open the mysterious door  she was cautiously  putting the key into the key hole  so as not to make the least noise   when she was suddenly startled by a voice behind her  which said   who  gave you leave to open that door      she turned  and saw helena standing at the half open bedchamber door      mercy  miss delacour  who thought of seeing you  for god s sake  don t  make a noise to waken my lady       did my mother desire you to go into that room   repeated helena      dear me  no  miss   said the maid  putting on her stupid face   but  i only thought to open the door  to let in a little air to freshen the  room  which my lady always likes  and bids me to do  and i thought       helena took the key gently from her hand without listening to any more  of her thoughts  and the woman left the room muttering something about   jelly  and  my lady   helena went to the side of her mother s bed   determined to wait there till she awakened  then to give her the key   and tell her the circumstance  notwithstanding the real simplicity of  this little girl s character  she was  as her mother had discovered   a  nice observer   and she had remarked that her mother permitted no one  but marriott to go into the boudoir  this remark did not excite her  to dive into the mystery  on the contrary  she carefully repressed all  curiosity  remembering the promise she had given to her mother when she  talked of zobeide and the porter  she had not been without temptation to  break this promise  for the maid who usually attended her toilette had  employed every art in her power to stimulate her curiosity  as she was  dressing helena this morning  she had said to her   the reason i was so  late calling you  miss  this morning  was because i was so late  myself last night  for i went to the play  miss  last night  which was  bluebeard  lord bless us  i m sure  if i had been bluebeard s wife  i  should have opened the door  if i d died for it  for to have the notion  of living all day long  and all night too  in a house in which there  was a room that one was never to go into  is a thing i could not put up  with   then after a pause  and after waiting in vain for some reply  from helena  she added   pray  miss delacour  did you ever go into that  little room within my lady s bedchamber  that mrs  marriott keeps the  key of always       no   said helena      i ve often wondered what s in it  but then that s only because i m a  simpleton  i thought to be sure   you  knew      observing that helena looked much displeased  she broke off her speech   hoping that what she had said would operate in due time  and that she  should thus excite the young lady to get the secret from marriott  which  she had no doubt afterward of  worming  from miss delacour     in all this she calculated ill  for what she had said only made helena  distrust and dislike her  it was the recollection of this conversation  that made her follow the maid to her mother s bedchamber  to see what  detained her there so long  helena had heard marriott say  that  she  ought not to run up and down stairs  because her lady was asleep   and  it appeared extraordinary that but a few minutes after this information  she should have gone into the room with a glass of jelly in her hand      ah  mamma   thought helena  as she stood beside her mother s bed   you  did not understand  and perhaps you did not believe me  when i said that  i would not try to find out any thing that you wished me not to know   now i hope you will  understand  me better      lady delacour opened her eyes   helena   cried she  starting up   how  came you by that key       oh  mother  don t look as if you suspected me   she then told her  mother how the key came into her hands      my dear child  you have done me an essential service   said lady  delacour   you know not its importance  at least in my estimation  but  what gives me infinitely more satisfaction  you have proved yourself  worthy of my esteem  my love      marriott came into the room  and whispered a few words to her lady      you may speak out  marriott  before my helena   said lady delacour   rising from the bed as she spoke   child as she is  helena has deserved  my confidence  and she shall be convinced that  where her mother has  once reason to confide  she is incapable of suspicion  wait here for a  few minutes  my dear      she went to her boudoir  paid and dismissed the surgeon expeditiously   then returned  and taking her daughter by the hand  she said   you  look all simplicity  my dear  i see you have no vulgar  school girl  curiosity  you will have all your mother s strength of mind  may you  never have any of her faults  or any of her misfortunes  i speak to you  not as to a child  helena  for you have reason far above your years  and  you will remember what i now say to you as long as you live  you will  possess talents  beauty  fortune  you will be admired  followed  and  flattered  as i have been  but do not throw away your life as i have  thrown away mine  to win the praise of fools  had i used but half the  talents i possess  as i hope you will use yours  i might have been an  ornament to my sex  i might have been a lady anne percival      here lady delacour s voice failed  but commanding her emotion  she in a  few moments went on speaking      choose your friends well  my dear daughter  it was my misfortune  my  folly  early in life to connect myself with a woman  who under the name  of frolic led me into every species of mischief  you are too young  too  innocent  to hear the particulars of my history now  but you will hear  them all at a proper time from my best friend  miss portman  i shall  leave you to her care  my dear  when i die       when you die   oh  mother   said helena   but why do you talk of  dying   and she threw her arms round her mother      gently  my love   said lady delacour  shrinking back  and she seized  this moment to explain to her daughter why she shrunk in this manner  from her caresses  and why she talked of dying     helena was excessively shocked      i wished  my dear   resumed her mother  calmly   i wished to have  spared you the pain of knowing all this  i have given you but little  pleasure in my life  it is unjust to give you so much pain  we shall go  to twickenham to morrow  and i will leave you with your aunt margaret   my dear  till all is over  if i die  belinda will take you with her  immediately to oakly park  you shall have as little sorrow as possible   if you had shown me less of your affectionate temper  you would have  spared yourself the anguish that you now feel  and you would have spared  me        my dear  kind mother   interrupted helena  throwing herself on her  knees at her mother s feet   do not send me away from you  i don t wish  to go to my aunt margaret  i don t wish to go to oakly park  i wish  to stay with you  do not send me away from you  for i shall suffer ten  times more if i am not with you  though i know i can be of no use      overcome by her daughter s entreaties  lady delacour at last consented  that she should remain with her  and that she should accompany her to  twickenham     the remainder of this day was taken up in preparations for their  departure  the  stupid maid  was immediately dismissed  no questions  were asked  and no reasons for her dismissal assigned  except that lady  delacour had no farther occasion for her services  marriott alone was  to attend her lady to twickenham  lord delacour  it was settled  should  stay in town  lest the unusual circumstance of his attending his lady  should excite public curiosity  his lordship  who was naturally a  good natured man  and who had been touched by the kindness his wife had  lately shown him  was in extreme agitation during the whole of this day   which he thought might possibly be the last of her existence  she  on  the contrary  was calm and collected  her courage seemed to rise with  the necessity for its exertion     in the morning  when the carriage came to the door  as she parted  with lord delacour  she put into his hand a paper that contained some  directions and requests with which  she said  she hoped that he would  comply  if they should prove to be her  last   the paper contained only  some legacies to her servants  a provision for marriott  and a bequest  to her excellent and beloved friend  belinda portman  of the cabinet in  which she kept clarence hervey s letters     interlined in this place  lady delacour had written these words   my  daughter is nobly provided for  and lest any doubt or difficulty should  arise from the omission  i think it necessary to mention that the said  cabinet contains the valuable jewels left to me by my late uncle   and that it is my intention that the said jewels should be part of  my bequest to the said belinda portman   if she marry a man of good  fortune  she will wear them for my sake  if she do not marry an opulent  husband  i hope she will sell the jewels without scruple  as they are  intended for her convenience  and not as an ostentatious bequest  it is  fit that she should be as independent in her circumstances as she is in  her mind      lord delacour with much emotion looked over this paper  and assured her  ladyship that she should be obeyed  if  he could say no more      farewell  then  my lord   said she   keep up your spirits  for i intend  to live many years yet to try them            chapter xxii     a spectre       the surgeon who was to attend lady delacour was prevented from going  to her on the day appointed  he was one of the surgeons of the queen s  household  and his attendance was required at the palace  this delay was  extremely irksome to lady delacour  who had worked up her courage to the  highest point  but who had not prepared herself to endure suspense  she  spent nearly a week at twickenham in this anxious state  and belinda  observed that she every day became more and more thoughtful and  reserved  she seemed as if she had some secret subject of meditation   from which she could not bear to be distracted  when helena was present   she exerted herself to converse in her usual sprightly strain  but as  soon as she could escape  as she thought  unobserved  she would shut  herself up in her own apartment  and remain there for hours      i wish to heaven  miss portman   said marriott  coming one morning  into her room with a portentous face   i wish to heaven  ma am  that you  could any way persuade my lady not to spend so many hours of the day and  night as she does in reading those methodistical books that she keeps to  herself   i m sure that they do her no good  but a great deal of harm   especially now when her spirits should be kept up as much as possible   i am sensible  ma am  that  tis those books that have made my lady  melancholy of a sudden  ma am  my lady has let drop very odd  hints within these two or three days  and she speaks in a strange   disconnected  sort of style  and at times i do not think she is quite  right in her head      when belinda questioned marriott more particularly about the strange  hints which her lady had let fall  she with looks of embarrassment  and horror declined repeating the words that had been said to her  yet  persisted in asserting that lady delacour had been very  strange  for  these two or three days   and i m sure  ma am  you d be shocked if you  were to see my lady in a morning  when she wakens  or rather when i  first go into the room  for  as to wakening  that s out of the question   i am certain she does not sleep during the whole night  you ll find   ma am  it is as i tell you  those books will quite turn her poor head   and i wish they were burnt  i know the mischief that the same sort of  things did to a poor cousin of my own  who was driven melancholy mad  by a methodist preacher  and came to an untimely end  oh  ma am  if you  knew as much as i do  you d be as much alarmed for my lady as i am      it was impossible to prevail upon marriott to explain herself more  distinctly  the only circumstances that could be drawn from her seemed  to belinda so trifling as to be scarcely worth mentioning  for instance   that lady delacour  contrary to marriott s advice  had insisted on  sleeping in a bedchamber upon the ground floor  and had refused to let  a curtain be put up before a glass door that was at the foot of her bed    when i offered to put up the curtain  ma am   said marriott   my lady  said she liked the moonlight  and that she would not have it put up till  the fine nights were over  now  miss portman  to hear my lady talk of  the moon  and moonlights  and liking the moon  is rather extraordinary  and unaccountable  for i never heard her say any thing of the sort in  her life before  i question whether she ever knew there was a moon or  not from one year s end to another  but they say the moon has a great  deal to do with mad people  and  from my own experience  i m perfectly  sensible  ma am  it had in my own cousin s case  for  before he came to  the worst  he took a prodigious fancy to the moon  and was always for  walking by moonlight  and talking to one of the beauty of the moon  and  such melancholy nonsense  ma am      belinda could not forbear smiling at this melancholy nonsense  though  she was inclined to be of marriott s opinion about the methodistical  books  and she determined to talk to lady delacour on the subject   the moment that she made the attempt  her ladyship  commanding her  countenance  with her usual ability  replied only by cautious  cold  monosyllables  and changed the conversation as soon as she could     at night  when they were retiring to rest  marriott  as she lighted them  to their rooms  observed that she was afraid her lady would suffer from  sleeping in so cold a bedchamber  and belinda pressed her friend to  change her apartment      no  my dear   replied lady delacour  calmly   i have chosen this for  my bedchamber  because it is at a distance from the servants  rooms  and  when  the operation   which i have to go through  shall be performed  my  cries  if i should utter any  will not be overheard  the surgeon will be  here in a few days  and it is not worth while to make any change      the next day  towards evening  the surgeon and dr  x     arrived   belinda s blood ran cold at the sight of them      will you be so kind  miss portman   said marriott   as to let my lady  know that they are come  for i am not well able to go  and you can speak  more composed to her than i can      miss portman went to lady delacour s bedchamber  the door was bolted   as lady delacour opened it  she fixed her eyes upon belinda  and said  to her with a mild voice   you are come to tell me that the surgeon is  arrived  i knew that by the manner in which you knocked at the door   i will see him this moment   continued she  in a firm tone  and she  deliberately put a mark in the book which she had been reading   walked leisurely to the other end of the room  and locked it up in her  book case  there was an air of determined dignity in all her motions    shall we go  i am ready   said she  holding out her hand to belinda   who had sunk upon a chair      one would think that you were the person that was going to suffer  but  drink this water  my dear  and do not tremble for me  you see that i do  not tremble for myself  listen to me  dearest belinda  i owe it to  your friendship not to torment you with unnecessary apprehensions  your  humanity shall be spared this dreadful scene       no   said belinda   marriott is incapable of attending you  i must  i  will  i am ready now  forgive me one moment s weakness  i admire  and  will imitate  your courage  i will keep my promise       your promise was to be with me in my dying moments  and to let me  breathe my last in your arms       i hope that i shall never be called upon to perform that promise      lady delacour made no answer  but walked on before her with steady steps  into the room where dr  x     and the surgeon were waiting  without  adverting in the least to the object of their visit  she paid her  compliments to them  as if they came on a visit of mere civility   without seeming to notice the serious countenances of her companions   she talked of indifferent subjects with the most perfect ease  occupying  herself all the time with cleaning a seal  which she unhooked from her  watch chain   this seal   said she  turning to dr  x       is a fine  onyx  it is a head of esculapius  i have a great value for it  it was  given to me by your friend  clarence hervey  and i have left it in my  will  doctor   continued she  smiling   to you  as no slight token of my  regard  he is an excellent young man  and i request   said she  drawing  dr  x     to a window  and lowering her voice   i request  when you see  him again  and when i am out of the way  that you will tell him such  were my sentiments to the hour of my death  here is a letter which you  will have the goodness to put into his hands  sealed with my favourite  seal  you need have no scruple to take charge of it  it relates not to  myself  it expresses only my opinion concerning a lady who stands almost  as high in your esteem  i believe  as she does in mine  my affection  and my gratitude have not biassed my judgment in the advice which i have  ventured to give to mr  hervey       but he will soon be here   interrupted dr  x       and then        and then i shall be gone   said lady delacour  coolly           to that undiscover d country       from whose bourn no traveller returns       dr  x     was going to interrupt her  but she continued rapidly   and  now  my dear doctor  tell me candidly  have you seen any symptoms of  cowardice in my manner this evening       none   replied he   on the contrary  i have admired your calm  self possession       then do not suspect me of want of fortitude  when i request that this  operation may not be performed to day  i have changed my mind within  these few hours  i have determined  for a reason which i am sure that  you would feel to be sufficient  to postpone this affair till to morrow   believe me  i do not act from caprice      she saw that dr  x     did not yield assent to her last assertion  and  that he looked displeased      i will tell you my reason   said she   and then you will have no  right to be displeased if i persist  as i shall inflexibly  in my  determination  it is my belief that i shall die this night  to submit to  a painful operation to day would be only to sacrifice the last moments  of my existence to no purpose  if i survive this night  manage me as  you please  but i am the best judge of my own feelings  i shall die  to night      dr  x     looked at her with a mixture of astonishment and compassion   her pulse was high  she was extremely feverish  and he thought that the  best thing which he could do was to stay with her till the next day  and  to endeavour to divert her mind from this fancy  which he considered as  an insane idea  he prevailed upon the surgeon to stay with her till the  next morning  and he communicated his intentions to belinda  who joined  with him in doing all that was possible to entertain and interest her  by conversation during the remainder of the day  she had sufficient  penetration to perceive that they gave not the least faith to her  prognostic  and she never said one word more upon the subject  but  appeared willing to be amused by their attempts to divert her  and  resolute to support her courage to the last moment  she did not affect  trifling gaiety  on the contrary  there was in all she said more  strength and less point than usual     the evening passed away  and lady delacour seemed totally to have  forgotten her own prophecy respecting the event of the ensuing night   so much so  that she spoke of several things that she intended to do the  next day  helena knew nothing of what had passed  and belinda imagined  that her friend put this constraint upon herself to avoid alarming her  daughter  yet  after helena retired  her mother s manner continued to be  so much the same  that dr  x     began to believe that her ladyship  was actuated merely by caprice  in this opinion she confirmed him by  bursting out a laughing when he proposed that some one should sit up  with her during the night      my sage sir   said she   have you lived to this time without ever  having been duped by a woman before  i wanted a day s reprieve  and i  have gained it  gained a day  spent in most agreeable conversation  for  which i thank you  to morrow   said she  turning to the surgeon   i must  invent some new excuse for my cowardice  and though i give you notice of  it beforehand  as harrington did when he picked the man s pocket  yet   nevertheless  i shall succeed  good night      she hurried to her own apartment  leaving them all in astonishment and  perplexity  belinda was persuaded that she only affected this gaiety to  prevent dr  x     from insisting upon sitting up in her room  as he had  proposed  doctor x      judging  as he said  from her ladyship s general  character  attributed the whole to caprice  and the surgeon  judging   as he said  from human nature in general  was decided in his belief that  she had been influenced  as she herself declared  by cowardice  after  having all expressed their opinions  without making any impression upon  one another  they retired to rest     belinda s bedchamber was next to helena s  and after she had been in bed  about an hour  she fancied that she heard some one walking softly in  the next room  she rose  and found lady delacour standing beside her  daughter s bed  she started at the sight of belinda  but only said in  a low voice  as she pointed to her child   don t waken her   she then  looked at her for some moments in silence  the moon shone full upon  her face  she stooped over helena  parted the ringlets of hair upon her  forehead  and kissed her gently      you will be good to this poor girl when i am gone  belinda   said she   turning away from her as she spoke   i only came to look at her for the  last time       are you then serious  my dear lady delacour       hush  don t waken her   said lady delacour  putting her finger on her  lips  and walking slowly out of the room  she forbade belinda to follow      if my fears be vain   said she   why should i disturb you with them  if  they be just  you will hear my bell ring  and then come to me      for some time afterward all was perfectly silent in the house  belinda  did not go to bed  but sat waiting and listening anxiously  the clock  struck two  and as she heard no other sound  she began to hope that she  had suffered herself to be falsely alarmed by a foolish imagination  and  she lay down upon her bed  resolving to compose herself to rest  she was  just sinking to sleep  when she thought she heard the faint sound of a  bell  she was not sure whether she was dreaming or awake  she started up  and listened  all was silent  but in a few minutes lady delacour s bell  rang violently  belinda flew to her room  the surgeon was already there   he had been sitting up in the next room to write letters  and he  had heard the first sound of the bell  lady delacour was senseless   supported in the surgeon s arms  belinda  by his directions  ran  immediately for doctor x      who was at the other end of the house   before she returned  lady delacour had recovered her senses  she begged  that the surgeon would leave the room  and that neither dr  x     nor  marriott might be yet admitted  as she had something of importance to  communicate to miss portman  the surgeon withdrew  and she beckoned to  belinda  who sat down upon the side of her bed  lady delacour held out  her hand to her  it was covered with a cold dew      my dear friend   said she   my prophecy is accomplishing  i know i must  die       the surgeon said that you were not in the least danger  my dear lady  delacour  that it was merely a fainting fit  do not suffer a vain  imagination thus to overpower your reason       it is no vain imagination  i must die   said lady delacour          i hear a voice you cannot hear           which says i must not stay       i see a hand you cannot see           which beckons me away       you perceive that i am in my perfect senses  my dear  or i could not  quote poetry  i am not insane  i am not delirious      she paused   i am ashamed to tell you what i know will expose me to your  ridicule       ridicule   cried belinda   can you think me so cruel as to consider  your sufferings a subject for ridicule      lady delacour was overcome by the tenderness with which belinda spoke      i will then speak to you   said she   without reserve  inconsistent as  it is with the strength of mind which you might expect from me  i cannot  resist the impression which has been made on my mind by  a vision       a vision       three times   continued lady delacour   it has appeared to me about  this hour  the first night after we came here i saw it  last night it  returned  and to night i have beheld it for the third time  i consider  it as a warning to prepare for death  you are surprised  you are  incredulous  i know that this must appear to you extravagant  but depend  upon it that what i tell you is true  it is scarcely a quarter of an  hour since i beheld the figure of       that man for whose untimely  death i am answerable  whenever i close my eyes the same form appears  before me       these visions   said belinda   are certainly the effects of opium       the forms that flit before my eyes when i am between sleeping and  waking   said lady delacour   i am willing to believe  are the effects  of opium  but  belinda  it is impossible i should be convinced that my  senses have deceived me with respect to what i have beheld when i have  been as broad awake  and in as perfect possession of my understanding as  i am at this instant  the habits of my life  and the natural gaiety   not to say levity  of my temper  have always inclined me rather to  incredulity than to superstition  but there are things which no strength  of mind  no temerity can resist  i repeat it  this is a warning to me to  prepare for death  no human means  no human power can save me      here they were interrupted by marriott  who could no longer be  restrained from bursting into the room  dr  x     followed  and going  calmly to the side of lady delacour s bed  took her hand to feel her  pulse      mrs  marriott  you need not alarm yourself in this manner   said he    your lady is at this instant in as little danger as i am        you  think she ll live  oh  my lady  why did you terrify us in this  manner      lady delacour smiled  and calmly said  as doctor x     still continued  to count her pulse   the pulse may deceive you  doctor  but i do not   marriott  you may       belinda heard no more  for at this instant  as she was standing alone   near the glass door that was opposite to the bed  she saw at a distance  in the garden the figure which lady delacour had described  lady  delacour was now so intent upon speaking to dr  x      that she saw  nothing but him  belinda had the presence of mind to be perfectly  silent  the figure stood still for some moments  she advanced a few  steps nearer to the window  and the figure vanished  she kept her eye  steadily fixed upon the spot where it had disappeared  and she saw it  rise again and glide quickly behind some bushes  belinda beckoned to dr   x      who perceived by the eagerness of her manner  that she wished  to speak to him immediately  he resigned his patient to marriott  and  followed miss portman out of the room  she told him what she had just  seen  said it was of the utmost consequence to lady delacour to have the  truth ascertained  and requested that dr  x    would go with some of  the men servants and search the garden  to discover whether any one was  there concealed  or whether any footsteps could be traced  the doctor  did not search long before he perceived footsteps in the borders  opposite to the glass door of lady delacour s bedchamber  he was  carefully following their track  when he heard a loud cry  which seemed  to come from the other side of the garden wall  there was a breach  in the wall over which he scrambled with some difficulty  the screams  continued with redoubled violence  as he was making his way to the  spot from which they proceeded  he was met by the old gardener  who was  crossing one of the walks with a lantern in his hand      ho  ho   cried the gardener   i take it that we have the thief at last   i fancy that the fellow whose footsteps i traced  and who has been at my  morello cherry tree every night  has been caught in the trap  i hope his  leg is not broke  though  this way  sir  this way      the gardener led the doctor to the place  and there they found a man   whose leg had actually been caught in the spring trap which had been set  for the defence of the cherry tree  the man had by this time fallen into  a swoon  they extricated him as fast as possible  and doctor x      had him brought to lady delacour s  in order that the surgeon  who was  there  might see his leg     as they were carrying him across the hall  belinda met them  she poured  out a glass of water for the man  who was just recovering from his  swoon  but as she went nearer to give it him  she was struck with his  wonderful resemblance to harriot freke      it must be mrs  freke herself   whispered she to marriott  whose wide  opening eyes  at this instant  fixed themselves upon her      it must be mrs  freke herself  ma am   repeated marriott     and so in fact it was     there is a certain class of people  who are incapable of generous  confidence in their equals  but who are disposed to yield implicit  credit to the underhand information of mean emissaries  through the  medium of champfort and the  stupid maid   mrs  freke had learned a  confused story of a man s footsteps having been heard in lady delacour s  boudoir  of his being let in by marriott secretly  of his having  remained locked up there for several hours  and of the maid s having  been turned away  merely because she innocently went to open the door  whilst the gentleman was in concealment  mrs  freke was farther informed  by the same unquestionable authority  that lady delacour had taken a  house at twickenham  for the express purpose of meeting her lover  that  miss portman and marriott were the only persons who were to be of this  party of pleasure     upon the faith of this intelligence  mrs  freke  who had accompanied  mrs  luttridge to town  immediately repaired to twickenham  to pay a  visit to a third cousin  that she might have an opportunity of detecting  the intrigues  and afterwards of publishing the disgrace  of her former  friend  the desire of revenging herself upon miss portman  for having  declined her civilities at harrowgate  had also a powerful influence in  stimulating her malicious activity  she knew that if it were proved that  belinda was the confidante of lady delacour s intrigues  her reputation  must be materially injured  and that the percivals would then be as  desirous to break off as they now were anxious to promote the match with  mr  vincent  charmed with this hope of a double triumph  the vindictive  lady commenced her operations  nor was she ashamed to descend to the  character of a spy  the general and convenient name of  frolic   she  thought  would cover every species of meanness  she swore that  it was  charming fun to equip herself at night in men s clothes  and to sally  forth to reconnoitre the motions of the enemy      by an unfrequented path she used to gain the window that looked into  lady delacour s bedchamber  this was the figure which appeared at night  at a certain hour  and which  to her ladyship s disturbed imagination   seemed to be the form of colonel lawless  there was  indeed  a  resemblance in their size and persons  which favoured the delusion   for several nights mrs  freke paid these visits without obtaining  any satisfaction  but this night she thought herself overpaid for her  exertions  by the charming discovery which she fancied she had made  she  mistook the surgeon for a lover of lady delacour s  and she was hurrying  home with the joyful intelligence  when she was caught in the gardener s  trap  the agony that she suffered was at first intense  but in a few  hours the pain somewhat subsided  and in this interval of rest she  turned to belinda  and with a malicious smile said    miss portman   tis  fair i should pay for my peeping  but i shall not pay quite so dear for  it as some of my friends      miss portman did not in the least comprehend her  till she added   i m  sure you ll allow that  tis better for a lady to lose her leg than her  reputation  and for my part i d rather be caught in a man trap  than  have a man caught in my bedchamber  my service to your friend  lady  delacour  and tell her so       and do you know who that gentleman was  that you saw in her ladyship s  room       not i  not yet  but i ll make it my business to find out  i give you  fair notice  i m a very devil when provoked  why didn t you make me your  friend when you could   you ll not baffle me  i have seen all i wanted   and i am capable of painting all i saw  as to who the man might be   that s no matter  one lothario is as good as another for my purpose      longer had mrs  freke spoken with malignant triumph  had she not been  interrupted by a burst of laughter from the surgeon  her vexation was  indescribable when he informed her  that he was the man whom she had  seen in lady delacour s bedchamber  and whom she had mistaken for a  favoured lover     mrs  freke s leg was much cut and bruised  and now that she was no  longer supported by the hopes of revenge  she began to lament loudly and  incessantly the injury that she had sustained  she impatiently inquired  how long it was probable that she should be confined by this accident   and she grew quite outrageous when it was hinted  that the beauty of her  legs would be spoiled  and that she would never more be able to appear  to advantage in man s apparel  the dread of being seen by lady delacour  in the deplorable yet ludicrous situation to which she had reduced  herself operated next upon her mind  and every time the door of the  apartment opened  she looked with terror towards it  expecting to  see her ladyship appear  but though lady delacour heard from marriott  immediately the news of mrs  freke s disaster  she never disturbed her  by her presence  she was too generous to insult a fallen foe     early in the morning mrs  freke was by her own desire conveyed to her  cousin s house  where without regret we shall leave her to suffer the  consequences of her frolic      a false prophetess  nowithstanding all my visions  i have outlived the  night  you see   said lady delacour  to miss portman when they met in  the morning   i have heard  my dear belinda  and i believe  that the  passion of love  which can endure caprice  vice  wrinkles  deformity   poverty  nay  disease itself  is notwithstanding so squeamish as to  be instantaneously disgusted by the perception of folly in the object  beloved  i hope friendship  though akin to love  is of a more robust  constitution  else what would become of me  my folly  and my visions   and my spectre  oh  that i had not exposed myself to you in this manner   harriot freke herself is scarcely more contemptible  spies and cowards  are upon an equal footing  her malice and her  frolic  are consistent  with her character  but my fears and my superstition are totally  inconsistent with mine  forget the nonsense i talked to you last night   my dear  or fancy that i was then under the dominion of laudanum  this  morning you shall see lady delacour  herself again   is dr  x      is  the surgeon ready  where are they  i am prepared  my fortitude shall  redeem me in your opinion  belinda  and in my own      doctor x     and the surgeon immediately obeyed her summons     helena heard them go into lady delacour s room  and she saw by  marriott s countenance  who followed  that her mother was going to  submit to the operation  she sat down trembling on the steps which led  to her mother s room  and waited there a long time  as she thought  in  the most painful suspense  at last she heard some one call helena  she  looked up  and saw her father close to her      helena   said he   how is your mother       i don t know  oh  papa  you cannot go in there  now    said helena   stopping him as he was pressing forwards      why did not you or miss portman write to me yesterday  as you  promised   said lord delacour  in a voice that showed he was scarcely  able to ask the question      because  papa  we had nothing to tell you  nothing was done yesterday   but the surgeon is now there   said helena  pointing towards her  mother s room     lord delacour stood motionless for an instant  then suddenly seizing his  daughter s hand   let us go   said he   if we stay here  we shall  hear her screams   and he was hurrying her away  when the door of lady  delacour s apartment opened  and belinda appeared  her countenance  radiant with joy      good news  dear helena  oh  my lord  you are come in a happy moment  i  give you joy       joy  joy  joy   cried marriott  following      is it all over   said lord delacour      and without a single shriek   said helena   what courage       there s no need of shrieks  or courage either  thank god   said  marriott   dr  x     says so  and he is the best man in the world  and  the cleverest  and i was right from the first  i said it was impossible  my lady should have such a shocking complaint as she thought she had   there s no such thing at all in the case  my lord  i said so always   till i was persuaded out of my senses by that villainous quack  who  contradicted me for this own  molument  and doctor x     says  if my  lady will leave off the terrible quantities of laudanum she takes  he ll  engage for her recovery      the surgeon and dr  x     now explained to lord delacour that the  unprincipled wretch to whom her ladyship had applied for assistance had  persuaded her that she had a cancer  though in fact her complaint arose  merely from the bruise which she had received  he knew too well how to  make a wound hideous and painful  and so continue her delusion for his  own advantage  dr  x     observed  that if lady delacour would have  permitted either the surgeon or him to have  examined  sooner into the  real state of the case  it would have saved herself infinite pain  and  them all anxiety  belinda at this moment felt too much to speak      i m morally certain   cried marriott   mr  champfort would die with  vexation  if he could see the joy that s painted in my lord s face this  minute  and we may thank miss portman for this  for  twas she made every  thing go right  and i never expected to live to see so happy a day      whilst marriott ran on in this manner with all the volubility of joy   lord delacour passed her with some difficulty  and helena was in her  mother s arms in an instant     lady delacour  struck to the heart by their affectionate looks and  words  burst into tears   how little have i deserved this kindness from  you  my lord  or from you  my child  but my feelings   added she   wiping away her tears   shall not waste themselves in tears  nor in vain  thanks  my actions  the whole course of my future life  shall show that  i am not quite a brute  even brutes are won by kindness  observe  my  lord   continued she  smiling   i said  won   not  tamed    a tame lady  delacour would be a sorry animal  not worth looking at  were she even to  become domesticated  she would fare the worse       how so   how so  my dear   said lord delacour and belinda almost in the  same breath      how so   why  if lady delacour were to wash off her rouge  and lay  aside her air  and be as gentle  good  and kind as belinda portman  for  instance  her lord would certainly say to her          so alter d are your face and mind        twere perjury to love you now             chapter xxiii     the chaplain       in some minds  emotions of joy are always connected with feelings of  benevolence and generosity  lady delacour s heart expanded with the  sensations of friendship and gratitude  now that she was relieved from  those fears by which she had so long been oppressed      my dear daughter   said she to helena   have you at this instant any  wish that i can gratify   ask any thing you please  the fairy goodwill  shall contrive to get it for you in a trice  you have thought of a  wish at this moment  i know  by your eyes  by your blush  nay  do not  hesitate  do you doubt me because i do not appear before you in the  shape of a little ugly woman  like cinderella s godmother  or do you  despise me because you do not see a wand waving in my hand    ah  little  skilled of fairy lore   know that i am in possession of a talisman that  can command more than ever fairy granted  behold my talisman   continued  she  drawing out her purse  and showing the gold through the net work    speak boldly  then   cried she to helena   and be obeyed       ah  mamma   said helena   i was not thinking of what fairies or gold  can give  but you can grant my wish  and if you will let me  i will  whisper it to you      lady delacour stooped to hear her daughter s whisper      your wish is granted  my own grateful  charming girl   said her mother     helena s wish was  that her mother could be reconciled to her good aunt   margaret delacour     her ladyship sat down instantly  and wrote to mrs  delacour  helena was  the bearer of this letter  and lady delacour promised to wait upon this  excellent old lady as soon as she should return to town     in the meantime her ladyship s health rapidly improved under the skilful  care of dr  x      it had been terribly injured by the ignorance and  villany of the wretch to whom she had so long and so rashly trusted  the  nostrums which he persuaded her to take  and the immoderate use of opium  to which she accustomed herself  would have ruined her constitution  had  it not been uncommonly strong  dr  x     recommended it to her ladyship  to abstain gradually from opium  and this advice she had the resolution  to follow with uninterrupted perseverance     the change in lady delacour s manner of life  in the hours and the  company that she kept  contributed much to her recovery     she was no  longer in continual anxiety to conceal the state of her health from the  world  she had no secret to keep  no part to act  her reconciliation  with her husband and with his friends restored her mind to ease and  self complacency  her little helena was a source of daily pleasure  and  no longer conscious of neglecting her daughter  she no longer feared  that the affections of her child should be alienated  dr  x      well  aware that the passions have a powerful influence over the body  thought  it full as necessary  in some cases  to attend to the mind as to the  pulse  by conversing with lady delacour  and by combining hints and  circumstances  he soon discovered what had lately been the course of  her reading  and what impression it had made on her imagination   mrs  marriott  indeed  assisted him with her opinion concerning  the  methodistical books   and when he recollected the forebodings of death  which her ladyship had felt  and the terror with which she had been  seized on the night of mrs  freke s adventure  he was convinced that  superstitious horrors hung upon his patient s spirits  and affected her  health  to argue on religious subjects was not his province  much less  his inclination  but he was acquainted with a person qualified by his  profession and his character  to minister to a mind diseased   and he  resolved on the first favourable opportunity to introduce this gentleman  to her ladyship     one morning lady delacour was complaining to belinda  that the books in  the library were in dreadful confusion   my lord has really a very fine  library   said she   but i wish he had half as many books twice as well  arranged  i never can find any thing i want  dr  x      i wish to heaven  you could recommend a librarian to my lord  not a chaplain  observe       why not a chaplain  may i ask your ladyship   said the doctor      oh  because we had once a chaplain  who gave me a surfeit of the whole  tribe  the meanest sycophant  yet the most impertinent busy body  always  cringing  yet always intriguing  wanting to govern the whole family  and  at the same time every creature s humble servant  fawning to my lord  the bishop  insolent to the poor curate  anathematizing all who differed  from him in opinion  yet without dignity to enforce the respect due  to his faith or his profession  greedy for preferment  yet without a  thought of the duties of his office  it was the common practice of  this man to leap from his horse at the church door on a holiday  after  following a pack of hounds  huddle on his surplice  and gabble over  the service with the most indecent mockery of religion  do i speak with  acrimony  i have reason  it was this chaplain who first led my lord to  newmarket  it was he who first taught my lord to drink  then he was  a  wit   an insufferable wit  his conversation after he had drank was  such as no woman but harriot freke could understand  and such as few   gentlemen  could hear  i have never  alas  been thought a prude  but in  the heyday of my youth and gaiety  this man always disgusted me  in one  word  he was a buck parson  i hope you have as great a horror for this  species of animal as i have       full as great   replied dr  x       but i consider them as monsters   which belonging to no species  can disgrace none       they ought to be hunted by common consent out of civilized society    said lady delacour      they are by public opinion banished from all rational society  and your  ladyship s just indignation proves  that they have no chance of being  tolerated by fashion  but would it not allow such beings too much  consequence  would it not extend their power to do mischief  if we  perceived that one such person could disgust lady delacour with the  whole race of chaplains       it is uncommon   replied her ladyship   to hear a physician  earnest   in the defence of the clergy  and a literary philosophic physician too   shall we have an eulogium upon bishops as well as chaplains       we have had that already   replied dr  x       all ranks  persuasions   and descriptions of people  including  i hope  those stigmatized by the  name of philosophers  have joined in admiration of the bishop of st   pol de leon  the conduct of the real martyrs to their faith amongst  the french clergy  not even the most witty or brutal sceptic could  ridicule       you surprise me  doctor   said lady delacour   for i assure you that  you have the character of being very liberal in your opinions       i hope i am liberal in my opinions   replied the doctor   and that i  give your ladyship a proof of it       you would not then persecute a man or woman with ridicule for believing  more than you do   said lady delacour      those who persecute  to overturn religion  can scarcely pretend to more  philosophy  or more liberality  than those who persecute to support it    said dr  x          perhaps  doctor  you are only speaking popularly       i believe what i now say to be true   said dr  x       and i always  endeavour to make truth popular       but possibly these are only truths for ladies  doctor x     may be such  an ungallant philosopher  as to think that some truths are not fit for  ladies  he may hold a different language with gentlemen       i should not only be an ungallant but a weak philosopher   said dr   x       if i thought that truth was not the same for all the world  who can understand it  and who can doubt lady delacour s being of that  number      lady delacour  who  at the beginning of this conversation  had spoken  guardedly  from the fear of lowering the doctor s opinion of her  understanding  was put at her ease by the manner in which he now spoke   and  half laying aside the tone of raillery  she said to him   well   doctor  seriously  i am not so  illiberal  as to condemn  all  chaplains  for one  odious as he was  but where to find his contrast in these  degenerate days  can you  who are a defender of the faith  and so forth   assist me  will you recommend a chaplain to my lord       willingly   said dr  x       and that is what i would not say for a  world of fees  unless i were sure of my man       what sort of a man is he       not a buck parson       and i hope not a pedant  not a dogmatist  for that would be almost  as bad  before we domesticate another chaplain  i wish to know all his  qualities  and to have a full and true description of him       shall i then give you a full and true description of him in the words  of chaucer       in any words you please  but chaucer s chaplain must be a little  old fashioned by this time  i should think       pardon me  some people  as well as some things  never grow  old fashioned  i should not be ashamed to produce chaucer s parish  priest at this day to the best company in england  i am not ashamed to  produce him to your ladyship  and if i can remember twenty lines in his  favour  i hope you will give me credit for being a sincere friend to the  worthy part of the clergy  observe  you must take them as i can patch  them together  i will not promise that i can recollect twenty lines  de  suite   and without missing a word  that is what i would not swear to do  for his grace the archbishop of canterbury       his grace will probably excuse you from swearing  at least i will    said lady delacour   on the present occasion  so now for your twenty  lines in whatever order you please      doctor x      with sundry intervals of recollection  which may be spared  the reader  repeated the following lines          yet has his aspect nothing of severe       but such a face as promised him sincere       nothing reserved or sullen was to see       but sweet regards  and pleasing sanctity       mild was his accent  and his action free       with eloquence innate his tongue was arm d       though harsh the precept  yet the preacher charm d       for  letting down the golden chain from high       he drew his audience upwards to the sky       he taught the gospel rather than the law       and forced himself to drive  but loved to draw       the tithes his parish freely paid  he took       but never sued  or curs d with bell and book       wide was his parish  not contracted close      in streets  but here and there a straggling house       yet still he was at hand  without request       to serve the sick  and succour the distressed       the proud he tamed  the penitent he cheer d       nor to rebuke the rich offender fear d       his preaching much  but more his practice wrought       a living sermon of the truths he taught      lady delacour wished that she could find a chaplain  who in any degree  resembled this charming parish priest  and dr  x    promised that he  would the next day introduce to her his friend mr  moreton      mr  moreton   said belinda   the gentleman of whom mr  percival spoke   mrs  freke s mr  moreton       yes   said dr  x       the clergyman whom mrs  freke hanged in effigy   and to whom clarence hervey has given a small living      these circumstances  even if he had not precisely resembled chaucer s  character of a benevolent clergyman  would have strongly interested  lady delacour in his favour  she found him  upon farther acquaintance  a  perfect contrast to her former chaplain  and he gradually acquired such  salutary influence over her mind  that he relieved her from the terrors  of methodism  and in their place substituted the consolations of mild  and rational piety     her conscience was now at peace  her spirits were real and equable  and  never was her conversation so agreeable  animated with the new feelings  of returning health  and the new hopes of domestic happiness  she  seemed desirous to impart her felicity to all around her  but chiefly  to belinda  who had the strongest claims upon her gratitude  and the  warmest place in her affections  belinda never made her friend feel the  weight of any obligation  and consequently lady delacour s gratitude  was a voluntary pleasure  not an expected duty  nothing could be more  delightful to miss portman than thus to feel herself the object at once  of esteem  affection  and respect  to see that she had not only been  the means of saving her friend s life  but that the influence she had  obtained over her mind was likely to be so permanently beneficial both  to her and to her family     belinda did not take all the merit of this reformation to herself  she  was most willing to share it  in her own imagination  not only with dr   x    and mr  moreton  but with poor clarence hervey  she was pleased to  observe that lady delacour never omitted any occasion of doing justice  to his merit  and she loved her for that generosity  which sometimes  passed the bounds of justice in her eulogiums  but belinda was careful  to preserve her consistency  and to guard her heart from the dangerous  effect of these enthusiastic praises  and as lady delacour was now  sufficiently re established in her health  she announced her intention  of returning immediately to oakly park  according to her promise to lady  anne percival and to mr  vincent      but  my dear   said lady delacour   one week more is all i ask from  you  may not friendship ask such a sacrifice from love       you expect  i know   said miss portman  ingenuously   that before the  end of that time mr  hervey will be here       true  and have you no friendship for him   said lady delacour with  an arch smile   or is friendship for every man in the creation   one augustus vincent always excepted  prohibited by the statutes of  oakly park       by the statutes of oakly park nothing is forbidden   said belinda   but  what reason        reason  oh  i have done if you go to reason  you are invulnerable to  the light shafts of wit  i know  when you are cased in this heavy armour  of reason  cupid himself may strain his bow  and exhaust his quiver  upon you in vain  but have a care  you cannot live in armour all your  life  lay it aside but for a moment  and the little bold urchin will  make it his prize  remember  in one of raphael s pictures  cupid  creeping into the armour of the conqueror of the world       i am sufficiently aware   said belinda  smiling   of the power of  cupid  and of his wiles  i would not brave his malice  but i will fly  from it       it is so cowardly to fly       surely prudence  not courage  is the virtue of our sex  and seriously   my dear lady delacour  i entreat you not to use your influence over my  mind  lest you should lessen my happiness  though you cannot alter my  determination      moved by the earnest manner in which belinda uttered these words  lady  delacour rallied her no more  nor did she longer oppose her resolution  of returning immediately to oakly park      may i remind you   said miss portman   though it is seldom either  politic or polite  to remind people of their promises   but may i  remind you of something like a promise you made  to accompany me to mr   percival s       and would you have me behave so brutally to poor lord delacour  as to  run away from him in this manner the moment i have strength to run       lord delacour is included in this invitation   said miss portman   putting the last letter that she had received from lady anne percival  into her hands      when i recollect   said lady delacour  as she looked over the letter    how well this lady anne of yours has behaved to me about helena  when  i recollect  that  though you have been with her so long  she has not  supplanted me in your affections  and that she did not attempt to detain  you when i sent marriott to oakly park  and when i consider how much for  my own advantage it will be to accept this invitation  i really cannot  bring myself  from pride  or folly  or any other motive  to refuse it   so  my dear belinda  prevail upon lord delacour to spend his christmas  at oakly park  instead of at studley manor  rantipole  thank heaven  is  out of the question   and prevail upon yourself to stay a few days for  me  and you shall take us all with you in triumph      belinda was convinced that  when lady delacour had once tasted the  pleasures of domestic life  she would not easily return to that  dissipation which she had followed from habit  and into which she had  first been driven by a mixture of vanity and despair  all the connexions  which she had imprudently formed with numbers of fashionable but  extravagant and thoughtless women would insensibly be broken off by  this measure  for lady delacour  who was already weary of their company   would be so much struck with the difference between their insipid  conversation and the animated and interesting society in lady anne  percival s family  that she would afterwards think them not only  burdensome but intolerable  lord delacour s intimacy with lord studley  was one of his chief inducements to that intemperance  which injured  almost equally his constitution and his understanding  for some weeks  past he had abstained from all excess  and belinda was well aware  that   when the immediate motive of humanity to lady delacour ceased to act  upon him  he would probably return to his former habits  if he continued  to visit his former associates  it was therefore of importance to break  at once his connexion with lord studley  and to place him in a situation  where he might form new habits  and where his dormant talents might be  roused to exertion  she was convinced that his understanding was not so  much  below par  as she had once been taught to think it  she perceived   also  that since their reconciliation  lady delacour was anxious to  make him appear to advantage  whenever he said any thing that was worth  hearing  she looked at belinda with triumph  and whenever he happened to  make  a mistake  in conversation  she either showed involuntary signs of  uneasiness  or passed it off with that easy wit  by which she generally  knew how  to make the worse appear the better reason   miss portman  knew that mr  percival possessed the happy talent of drawing out all the  abilities of those with whom he conversed  and that he did not value men  merely for their erudition  science  or literature  he was capable of  estimating  the potential  as well as  the actual range  of the mind  of  his generosity she could not doubt  and she was persuaded that he would  take every possible means which good nature  joined to good sense  could  suggest  to raise lord delacour in his lady s esteem  and to make that  union happy which was indissoluble  all these reflections passed with  the utmost rapidity in belinda s mind  and the result of them was  that  she consented to wait lady delacour s leisure for her journey           chapter xxiv     peu a peu       things were in this situation  when one day marriott made her appearance  at her lady s toilette with a face which at once proclaimed that  something had discomposed her  and that she was impatient to be asked  what it was      what is the matter  marriott   said lady delacour   for i know you want  me to ask       want you to ask  oh  dear  my lady  no   for i m sure  it s a thing  that goes quite against me to tell  for i thought  indeed  my lady    superiorly  of the person in question  so much so  indeed  that i  wished what i declare i should now be ashamed to mention  especially in  the presence of miss portman  who deserves the best that this world can  afford of every denomination  well  ma am  in one word   continued she   addressing herself to belinda   i am extremely rejoiced that things are  as they are  though i confess that was not always my wish or opinion   for which i beg mr  vincent s pardon and yours  but i hope to be  forgiven  since i m now come entirely round to my lady anne percival s  way of thinking  which i learnt from good authority at oakly park  and  i am now convinced and confident  miss portman  that every thing is for  the best       marriott will inform us  in due course of time  what has thus suddenly  and happily converted her   said lady delacour to belinda  who was  thrown into some surprise and confusion by marriott s address  but  marriott went on with much warmth      dear me  i m sure i thought we had got rid of all double dealers  when  the house was cleared of mr  champfort  but  oh  mercy  there s not  traps enough in the world for them all  i only wish they were all  caught as finely as some people were   tis what all double dealers  and  champfort at the head of the whole regiment  deserve  that s certain       we must take patience  my dear belinda   said lady delacour  calmly    till marriott has exhausted all the expletives in and out of the  english language  and presently  when she has fought all her battles  with champfort over again  we may hope to get at the fact       dear  my lady  it has nothing to do with mr  champfort  nor any such  style of personage  i can assure you  for  i m positive  i d rather  think contemptibly of a hundred million mr  champforts than of one such  gentleman as mr  clarence hervey       clarence hervey   exclaimed lady delacour  taking it for granted that  belinda blushed  her ladyship  with superfluous address  instantly  turned  so as to hide her friend s face from mrs  marriott   well   marriott  what of mr  hervey       oh  my lady  something you ll be surprised to hear  and miss portman   too  it is not  by any means  that i am more of a prude than is  becoming  my lady  nor that i take upon me to be so innocent as not to  know that young gentlemen of fortune will  if it be only for fashion s  sake  have such things as kept mistresses  begging pardon for mentioning  such trash   but no one that has lived in the world thinks any thing of  that  except   added she  catching a glimpse of belinda s countenance    except  to be sure  ma am  morally speaking  it s very wicked and  shocking  and makes one blush before company  till one s used to it   and ought certainly to be put down by act of parliament  ma am  but  my  lady  you know  in point of surprising any body  or being discreditable  in a young gentleman of mr  hervey s fortune and pretensions  it would  be mere envy and scandal to deem it any thing  worth mentioning       then  for mercy s sake  or mine   said lady delacour   go on to  something that is worth mentioning       well  my lady  you must know  then  that yesterday i wanted some  hempseed for my bullfinch  miss helena s bullfinch  i mean  for it was  she found it by accident  you know  miss portman  the day after we came  here  poor thing  it got itself so entangled in the net over the morello  cherry tree  in the garden  that it could neither get itself in nor out   but very luckily miss helena saw it  and saved  and brought it in  it  was almost dead  my lady       was it   i mean i am very sorry for it  that is what you expect me to  say  now  go on  get us once past the bullfinch  or tell us what it has  to do with clarence hervey       that is what i am aiming at  as fast as possible  my lady  so i sent  for some hempseed for the bullfinch  and along with the hempseed they  brought me wrapped round it  as it were  a printed handbill  as it might  be  or advertisement  which i threw off  disregardingly  taking for  granted it might have been some of those advertisements for lozenges or  razor strops  that meet one wherever one goes  but miss delacour picked  it up  and found it was a kind of hue and cry after a stolen or strayed  bullfinch  ma am  i was so provoked  i could have cried  when i learnt  it was the exact description of our little bobby to a feather  gray upon  the back  and red on          oh  spare me the description to a feather  well  you took the bird   bullfinch  or bobby  as you call it  home to its rightful owner  i  presume  let me get you so far on your way       no  i beg your pardon  my lady  that is not the thing       then you did not take the bird home to its owner  and you are a  bird stealer  with all my heart  be a dog stealer  if you will  only go  on       but  my lady  you hurry me so  it puts every thing topsy turvy in my  head  i could tell it as fast as possible my own way       do so  then       i was ready to cry  when i found our little bobby was claimed from  us  to be sure  but miss delacour observed  that those with whom it  had lived till it was grey must be sorrier still to part with it  so i  resolved to do the honest and genteel thing by the lady who advertised  for it  and to take it back myself  and to refuse the five guineas  reward offered  the lady s name  according to the advertisement  was  ormond       ormond   repeated lady delacour  looking eagerly at belinda   was not  that the name sir philip baddely mentioned to us  you remember       yes  ormond was the name  as well as i recollect   said belinda  with  a degree of steady composure that provoked her ladyship   go on   marriott       and the words were  to leave the bird at a perfumer s in twickenham   opposite to       but that s no matter  well  my lady  to the perfumer s  i went with the bird  this morning  now  i had my reasons for wishing  to see this mrs  ormond myself  because  my lady  there was one thing  rather remarkable about this bullfinch  that it sings a very particular  tune  which i never heard any bullfinch  or any human creature  sing  anything like before  so i determined  in my own cogitations  to ask  this mrs  ormond to name the tunes her bullfinch could sing  before i  produced it  and if she made no mention of its knowing any one out of  the common way  i resolved to keep my bird to myself  as i might very  conscientiously and genteelly too  so  my lady  when i got to the  perfumer s  i inquired where mrs  ormond was to be found  i was told  that she received no visits from any  at least from the female sex  and  that i must leave the bird there till called for  i was considering what  to do  and the strangeness of the information made about the female sex   when in there came  into the shop  a gentleman  who saved me all the  indelicacy of asking particulars  the bullfinch was at this time piping  away at a fine rate  and  as luck would have it  that very remarkable  strange tune that i mentioned to you  says the gentleman  as he came  into the shop  fixing his eyes on the bullfinch as if they would have  come fairly out of his head   how did that bird come here     i brought  it here  sir   said i  then he began to offer me mountains of gold in a  very strange way  if i could tell him any tidings of the lady to whom  it belonged  the shopman from behind the counter now bent forward  and  whispered the gentleman that he could give him some information  if he  would make it worth his while  and they both went together to a little  parlour behind the shop  and i saw no more of them  but  my lady  very  opportunely for me  that was dying with curiosity  out of the parlour  they turned a young woman in  to attend the shop  who proved to be an  acquaintance of mine  whom i had done some little favours to when in  service in london  and this young woman  when i told her my distress  about the advertisement and the bullfinch  let me into the whole of the  affair   ma am   said she   all that is known about mrs  ormond  in  this house  or any where else  is from me  so there was no occasion for  turning me out of the parlour  i lived with mrs  ormond  ma am    says she    for half a year  in the very house she now occupies  and  consequently nobody can be better informed than i am    to which i  agreed  then she told me that the reason that mrs  ormond never saw any  company of any sort was  because she is not fit to see company  proper  company  for she s not a proper woman  she has a most beautiful young  creature there  shut up  who has been seduced  and is now deserted in a  most cruel manner by a mr  hervey  oh  my lady  how the name struck  upon my ear  i hoped  however  it was not our mr  hervey  but it was the  identical mr  clarence hervey  i made the young woman describe him   for she had often and often seen him  when he visited the unfortunate  creature  and the description could suit none but our mr  hervey  and  besides it put it beyond a doubt  she told me his linen was all marked  c  h  so our mr  hervey  ma am   added marriott  turning to belinda   it  certainly proved to be  to my utter dismay and confusion       oh  marriott  my poor head   exclaimed lady delacour  starting from  under her hands   that cruel comb went at least half an inch into my  head  heads have feeling as well as hearts  believe me   and  as she  spoke  she snatched out the comb with which marriott had just fastened  up her hair  and flung it on a sofa at some yards  distance  while  marriott went to fetch it  lady delacour thought that belinda would  have time to recover from that utter dismay and confusion into which she  hoped that she must now be thrown   come  marriott  make haste  i  have done  you  at least a great favour  for you have all this hair to  perform upon again  and you will have leisure to finish this story  of yours  which  at all events  if it is not in any other respect  wonderful  we must allow is wonderfully long       well  my lady  to be short  then  i was more curious than ever  when  i heard all this  to hear more  and asked my friend how she could ever  think of staying in a house with ladies of such a description  upon  which she justified herself by assuring me  upon her honour  that at  first she believed the young lady was married privately to mr  hervey   for that a clergyman came in secret  and read prayers  and she verily  believes that the unfortunate young creature was deceived barbarously   and made to fancy herself married to all intents and purposes  till  all at once mr  hervey threw off the mask  and left off visiting her   pretending a necessity to take a journey  and handing her over to that  vile woman  that mrs  ormond  who bid her to be comforted  and all the  things that are said by such women  on such occasions  by all accounts   but the poor deluded young thing saw how it was now too plain  and she  was ready to break her heart  but not in a violent  common sort of way   ma am  but in silent grief  pining and drooping  my friend could not  stand the sight  nor endure to look upon mrs  ormond now she knew  what she was  and so she left the house  without giving any reason   immediately  i forgot to mention  that the unfortunate girl s maiden  name was st  pierre  my lady  but her christian name  which was rather  an out o  the way name  i quite forget       no matter   said lady delacour   we can live without it  or we can  imagine it       to be sure  i beg pardon  such sort of people s names can t be of any  consequence  and  i m sure  i blame myself now for going to the house   after all i had heard       you did go to the house  then       to my shame be it spoken  my curiosity got the better of me  and i  went   but only on account of the bullfinch in the eyes of the world  it  was a great while before i could get in  but i was so firm  that i would  not give up the bird to no one but the lady herself  that i got in at  last  oh  never did my eyes light upon so beautiful a creature  nor so  graceful  nor so innocent to look at    belinda sighed  marriott echoed  the sigh  and continued  she was by herself  and in tears  when i was  shown in  ma am  and she started as if she had never seen any body  before in her life  but when she saw the bullfinch  ma am  she clapped  her hands  and  smiling through her tears like a child  she ran up to  me  and thanked me again and again  kissing the bird between times  and  putting it into her bosom  well  i declare  if she had talked to all  eternity  she could never have made me pity her half so much as all this  did  for it looked so much like innocence  i m sure  nobody that was  not  or  at least  that did not think themselves innocent  could have  such ways  and such an innocent affection for a little bird  not but  what i know ladies of a certain description often have birds  but then  their fondness is all affectation and fashion  but this poor thing was  all nature  ah  poor unfortunate girl  thought i  but it s no matter  what i thought now   said marriott  shutting her eyes  to hide the tears  that came into them at this instant   i was ashamed of myself  when i  saw mrs  ormond just then come into the room  which made me recollect  what sort of company i was in  la  my lady  how i detested the sight  of her  she looked at me  too  more like a dragon than any thing else   though in a civil way  and as if she was frightened out of her wits   she asked miss st  pierre  as she called her  how i had got in  in a  whisper   and she made all sorts of signs afterward to her  to go out  of the room  never having been in such a situation before  i was quite  robbed of all fluency  and could not  what with the anger i felt for the  one  and sorrow for the other  get out a word of common sense  or even  recollect what pretence brought me into the room  till the bird very  luckily put it into my head by beginning to sing  so then i asked   whether they could certify it to be theirs by any particular tune of its  own   oh  yes   said miss st  pierre  and she sung the very same tune  i  never heard so sweet a voice  but  poor thing  something came across her  mind in the middle of it  and she stopped  but she thanked me again for  bringing back the bird  which  she said  had been hers for a great  many years  and that she loved it dearly  i stood  i believe  like one  stupified  till i was roused by  the woman s  offering to put the five  guineas reward  mentioned in the advertisement  into my hand  the touch  of her gold made me start  as if it had been a snake  and i pushed it  from me  and when she pressed it again  i threw it on the table  scarce  knowing what i did  and just then  in her iniquitous hand  i saw a  letter  directed to clarence hervey  esq  oh  how i hated the sight of  his name  and every thing belonging to him  ma am  at that minute   i m sure  i could not have kept myself from saying something quite  outrageous  if i had not taken myself out of the house  as i did  that  instant      when there are women enough born and bred good for nothing  and ladies  enough to flirt with  that would desire no better  that a gentleman like  mr  clarence hervey  ma am  should set his wits  as one may say  to  be the ruin of such a sweet  innocent looking young creature  and then  desert her in that barbarous way  after bringing a clergyman to deceive  her with a mock ceremony  and all  oh  there is no fashion  nor nothing  can countenance such wickedness   tis the worst of wickedness and  cruelty  and i shall think and say so to the latest hour of my life       well said  marriott   cried lady delacour      and now you know the reason  ma am   added marriott   that i said   i was glad  things are as they are   to be sure i and every body once  thought  but that s all over now  and i am glad  things are as they  are       lady delacour once more turned her quick eyes upon belinda  and was  much pleased to see that she seemed to sympathize with marriott s  indignation     in the evening  when they were alone  lady delacour touched upon  the subject again  and observed  that as they should now  in all  probability  see mr  hervey in a few days  they might be able to form  a better judgment of this affair  which she doubted not had been  exaggerated   you should judge from the whole of clarence s conduct and  character  and not from any particular part   said her ladyship   do not  his letters breathe a spirit of generosity       but   interrupted miss portman   i am not called upon to judge of mr   hervey s whole conduct and character  nor of any part of it  his letters  and his generosity are nothing        to you   said lady delacour with a smile      this is no time  and no subject for raillery  my dear friend   said  belinda   you assured me  and i believed you  that the idea of mr   hervey s return was entirely out of the question  when you prevailed  upon me to delay my journey to oakly park  as i now understand that your  ladyship has changed your mind  i must request your ladyship will permit  me        i will permit you to do what you please  dearest belinda  except  to call me  your ladyship  twice in one sentence  you shall go to  oakly park the day after to morrow  will that content you  my dear  i  admire your strength of mind  you are much fitter to conduct yourself  than i am to conduct you  i have done with raillery  my first  my only  object  is your happiness  i respect and esteem as much as i love you   and i love you better than any thing upon earth  power excepted  you  will say  power not excepted  believe me  and if you are one of those  strange people that cannot believe without proof  you shall have proof  positive upon the spot   added she  ringing the bell as she spoke   i  will no longer contend for power over your mind with your friends  at oakly park  i will give orders  in your presence  to marriott  to  prepare for our march  i did not call it retreat  but there is nothing  shows so much generalship as a good retreat  unless it be a great  victory  i am  i confess  rather prejudiced in favour of victory       so am i   said belinda  with a smile   i am so strongly prejudiced in  favour of victory  that rather than obtain no other  i would even be  content with a victory over myself      scarcely had belinda pronounced these words  when lord delacour  who had  dined in town  entered the room  accompanied by mr  vincent      give me leave  lady delacour  to introduce to you   said his  lordship   a young gentleman  who has a great  and  i am sure  a most  disinterested desire to cultivate your ladyship s further acquaintance      lady delacour received him with all the politeness imaginable  and even  her prepossessions in favour of clarence hervey could not prevent her  from being struck with his appearance  il a infiniment l air d un heros  de roman  thought she  and belinda is not quite so great a philosopher  as i imagined  in due time her ladyship recollected that she had orders  to give to marriott about her journey  that made it absolutely necessary  she should leave miss portman to entertain mr  vincent  if possible   without her  for a few minutes  and lord delacour departed  contenting  himself with the usual excuse of   letters to write       i ought to be delighted with your gallantry  mr  vincent   said  belinda   in travelling so many miles  to remind me of my promise about  oakly park  but on the contrary  i am sorry you have taken so much  unnecessary trouble  lady delacour is  at this instant  preparing  for our journey to mr  percival s  we intend to set out the day after  to morrow       i am heartily glad of it  i shall be infinitely overpaid for my  journey  by having the pleasure of going back with you      after some conversation upon different subjects  mr  vincent  with an  air of frankness which was peculiarly pleasing to belinda  put into her  hands an anonymous letter  which he had received the preceding day      it is not worth your reading   said he   but i know you too well to  fear that it should give you any pain  and i hope you know me too well   to apprehend that it could make any impression on my mind      belinda read with some surprise        rash young man  beware of connecting yourself with the lady to whom you  have lately been drawn in to pay your addresses  she is the most artful  of women  she has been educated  as you may find upon inquiry  by one   whose successful trade it has been to draw in young men of fortune for  her nieces  whence she has obtained the appellation of  the match maker  general   the only niece whom she could not get rid of any other way   she sent to the most dissipated and unprincipled viscountess in town   the viscountess fell sick  and  as it was universally reported last  winter  the young lady was immediately  upon her friend s death  to have  been married to the viscount widower  but the viscountess detected the  connexion  and the young lady  to escape from her friend s rage  and  from public shame  was obliged to retreat to certain shades in the  neighbourhood of harrowgate  where she passed herself for a saint upon  those who were too honourable themselves to be suspicious of others      at length the quarrel between her and the viscountess was made up  by  her address and boldness in declaring  that if she was not recalled  she  would divulge some secrets respecting a certain mysterious boudoir in  her ladyship s house  this threat terrified the viscountess  who sent  off express for her late discarded humble companion  the quarrel  was hushed up  and the young lady is now with her noble friend at  twickenham  the person who used to be let up the private stairs into  the boudoir  by mrs  marriott  is now more conveniently received at  twickenham      much more was said by the letter writer in the same strain  the name  of clarence hervey  in the last page  caught belinda s eye  and with a  trepidation which she did not feel at the beginning of this epistle  she  read the conclusion      the viscount is not supposed to have been unrivalled in the young  lady s favour  a young gentleman  of large fortune  great talents   and uncommon powers of pleasing  has  for some months  been her secret  object  but he has been prudent enough to escape her matrimonial snares   though he carries on a correspondence with her  through the means of her  friend the viscountess  to whom he privately writes  the noble lady has  bargained to make over to her confidante all her interest in hervey s  heart  he is expected every day to return from his tour  and  if the  schemes upon him can be brought to bear  the promised return to the  neighbourhood of harrowgate will never be thought of  mr  vincent will  be left in the lurch  he will not even have the lady s fair hand  her   fair  heart is clarence hervey s  at all events  further particulars  shall be communicated to mr  vincent  if he pays due attention to this  warning from     a sincere friend      as soon as belinda had finished this curious production  she thanked mr   vincent  with more kindness than she had ever before shown him  for the  confidence he placed in her  and for the openness with which he treated  her  she begged his permission to show this letter to lady delacour   though he had previously dreaded the effect which it might have upon her  ladyship s feelings     her first exclamation was   this is one of harriot freke s frolics   but  as her ladyship s indignation against mrs  freke had long since subsided  into utter contempt  she did not waste another thought upon the writer  of this horrible letter  but instantly the whole energy of her mind  and fire of her eloquence burst forth in an eulogium upon her friend   careless of all that concerned herself  she explained  without a  moment s hesitation  every thing that could exalt belinda  she described  all the difficult circumstances in which her friend had been placed  she  mentioned the secret with which she had been intrusted  the honour  with which  even at the hazard of her own reputation  she had kept  her promise of secrecy inviolable  when lord delacour  in a fit of  intoxication and jealousy  had endeavoured to wrest from marriott the  key of  the mysterious boudoir   she confessed her own absurd jealousy   explained how it had been excited by the artifices of champfort and sir  philip baddely  how slight circumstances had worked her mind up almost  to frenzy   the temper  the dignity  the gentleness  the humanity  with  which belinda bore with me  during this paroxysm of madness   said lady  delacour   i never can forget  nor the spirit with which she left my  house  when she saw me unworthy of her esteem  and ungrateful for her  kindness  nor the magnanimity with which she returned to me  when i  thought myself upon my death bed  all this has made an impression upon  my soul  which never  whilst i have life and reason  can be effaced  she  has saved my life  she has made my life worth saving  she has made  me feel my own value  she has made me know my own happiness  she has  reconciled me to my husband  she has united me with my child  she has  been my guardian angel    she   the confidante of my intrigues    she   leagued with me in vice   no  i am bound to her by ties stronger  than vice ever felt  than vice  even in the utmost ingenuity of its  depravity  can devise      exhausted by the vehemence with which she had spoken  lady delacour  paused  but vincent  who sympathized in her enthusiasm  kept his eyes  fixed upon her  in hopes that she had yet more to say      i might  perhaps  you will think   continued she  smiling   have spared  you this history of myself  and of my own affairs  mr  vincent  but  i thought it necessary to tell you the plain facts  which malice has  distorted into the most odious form  this is the quarrel  this is  the reconciliation  of which your anonymous friend has been so well  informed  now  as to clarence hervey       i have explained to mr  vincent   interrupted belinda   every thing  that he could wish to know on that subject  and i now wish you to tell  him that i faithfully remembered my promise to return to oakly park  and  that we were actually preparing for the journey       look here  sir   cried lady delacour  opening the door of her  dressing room  in which marriott was upon her knees  locking a trunk    here s dreadful note of preparation       you are a happier man than you yet know  mr  vincent   continued lady  delacour   for i can tell you  that some persuasion  some raillery  and  some wit  i flatter myself  have been used  to detain miss portman from  you       from oakly park   interrupted belinda      from oakly park   c  a few days longer  shall i be frank with you  mr   vincent   yes  for i cannot help it  i am not of the nature of anonymous  letter writers  i cannot  either secretly or publicly  sign or say  myself a  sincere friend   without being one to the utmost extent of  my influence  i never give my vote without my interest  nor my interest  without my vote  now clarence hervey is my friend  start not at all   sir   you have no reason  for if he is my friend  miss portman is yours   which has the better bargain  but  as i was going to tell you  mr   clarence hervey is my friend  and i am his  my vote  interest  and  influence  have consequently been all in his favour  i had reason to  believe that he has long admired  the dignity  of miss portman s  mind   and the simplicity of her character    continued her ladyship  with an  arch look at belinda   and though he was too much a man of genius to  begin with the present tense of the indicative mood   i love   yet i  was  and am  convinced  that he does love her       can you  dear lady delacour   cried belinda   speak in this manner  and  recollect all we heard from marriott this morning  and to what purpose  all this       to what purpose  my dear  to convince your friend  mr  vincent  that i  am neither fool nor knave  but that i deal fairly by you  by him  and  by all the world  mr  hervey s conduct towards miss portman has  i  acknowledge  sir  been undecided  some circumstances have lately come  to my knowledge which throw doubts upon his honour and integrity  doubts  which  i firmly believe  he will clear up to  my  satisfaction at  least  as soon as i see him  or as soon as it is in his power  with this  conviction  and believing  as i do  that no man upon earth is so well  suited to my friend   pardon me  mr  vincent  if my wishes differ from  yours  though my sincerity may give you present  it may save you from  future  pain       your ladyship s sincerity  whatever pain it may give me  i admire    said mr  vincent  with some pride in his manner   but i see that i must  despair of the honour of your ladyship s congratulations       pardon me   interrupted lady delacour   there you are quite mistaken   the man of belinda s choice  must  receive my congratulations  he must  do more  he must become my friend i would never rest till i had won his  regard  nor should i in the least be apprehensive that he would not have  sufficient greatness of mind to forgive my having treated him with a  degree of sincerity which the common forms of politeness cannot justify   and at which common souls would be scandalized past recovery      mr  vincent s pride was entirely vanquished by this speech  and with  that frankness by which his manners were usually characterized  he  thanked her for having distinguished him from  common souls   and  assured her that such sincerity as hers was infinitely more to his  taste than that refined politeness of which he was aware no one was more  perfect mistress than lady delacour     here their conversation ended  and mr  vincent  as it was now late  took  his leave      really  my dear belinda   said lady delacour  when he was gone   i am  not surprised at your impatience to return to oakly park  i am not so  partial to my knight  as to compare him  in personal accomplishments   with your hero  i acknowledge  also  that there is something vastly  prepossessing in the frankness of his manners  he has behaved admirably  well about this abominable letter  but  what is better than all in a  lady s eyes he is  eperdument amoureux        not  eperdument   i hope   said belinda      then  as you do not think it necessary for your hero to be  eperdument  amoureux   i presume   said lady delacour   you do not think it  necessary that a heroine should be in love at all  so love and marriage  are to be separated by philosophy  as well as by fashion  this is lady  anne percival s doctrine  i give mr  percival joy  i remember the time   when he fancied love essential to happiness       i believe he not only fancies  but is sure of it now  from experience    said belinda      then he interdicts love only to his friends  he does not think it  essential that you should know any thing about the matter  you may marry  his ward  and welcome  without being in love with him       but not without loving him   said belinda      i am not casuist enough in these matters to understand the subtle  distinction you make  with the true percival emphasis  between loving  and falling in love  but i suppose i am to understand by loving  loving  as half the world do when they marry       as it would be happy for half the world if they did   replied belinda   mildly  but with a firmness of tone that her ladyship felt   i should  despise myself and deserve no pity from any human being  if  after all i  have seen  i could think of marrying for convenience or interest       oh  pardon me  i meant not to insinuate such an idea  even your worst  enemy  sir philip baddely  would acquit you there  i meant but to hint   my dear belinda  that a heart such as yours is formed for love in its  highest  purest  happiest state      a pause ensued      such happiness can be secured only   resumed belinda   by a union with  a man of sense and virtue       a man of sense and virtue  i suppose  means mr  vincent   said lady  delacour   no doubt you have lately learned in the same sober style that  a little love will suffice with a great deal of esteem       i hope i have learned lately that a great deal of esteem is the best  foundation for a great deal of love       possibly   said lady delacour   but we often see people working at the  foundation all their lives without getting any farther       and those who build their castles of happiness in the air   said  belinda   are they more secure  wiser  or happier       wiser  i know nothing about that   said lady delacour   but happier  i do believe they are  for the castle building is always a  labour of  love   but the foundation of drudgery is generally  love s labour lost    poor vincent will find it so       perhaps not   said belinda   for already his solid good qualities        solid good qualities   interrupted lady delacour   i beg your pardon  for interrupting you  but  my dear  you know we never fall in love with  good qualities  except  indeed  when they are joined to an aquiline  nose  oh  that aquiline nose of mr  vincent s  i am more afraid of it  than of all his solid good qualities  he has again  i acknowledge it   much the advantage of clarence hervey in personal accomplishments  but  you are not a woman to be decided by personal accomplishments       and you will not allow me to be decided by solid good qualities   said  belinda   so by what must i be determined       by your heart  my dear  by your heart  trust your heart only       alas   said belinda   how many  many women have deplored their having  trusted to their hearts only        their  hearts  but i said  your  heart  mind your pronouns  my dear   that makes all the difference  but  to be serious  tell me  do you  really and  bona fide   as my old uncle the lawyer used to say  love mr   vincent       no   said belinda   i do not love him yet       but for that emphatic  yet   how i should have worshipped you  i wish i  could once clearly understand the state of your mind about mr  vincent   and then i should be able to judge how far i might indulge myself in  raillery without being absolutely impertinent  so without intruding upon  your confidence  tell me whatever you please       i will tell you all i know of my own mind   replied belinda  looking up  with an ingenuous countenance   i esteem mr  vincent  i am grateful  to him for the proofs he has given me of steady attachment  and of  confidence in my integrity  i like his manners and the frankness of  his temper  but i do not yet love him  and till i do  no earthly  consideration could prevail upon me to marry him       perfectly satisfactory  my dear belinda  and yet i cannot be quite  at ease whilst mr  vincent is present  and my poor clarence absent   proximity is such a dangerous advantage even with the wisest of us  the  absent lose favour so quickly in cupid s court  as in all other courts   and they are such victims to false reports and vile slanderers      belinda sighed      thank you for that sigh  my dear   said lady delacour   may i ask   would you  if you discovered that mr  vincent had a virginia  discard  him for ever from your thoughts       if i discovered that he had deceived and behaved dishonourably to any  woman  i certainly should banish him for ever from my regard       with as much ease as you banished clarence hervey       with more  perhaps       then you acknowledge  that s all i want  that you liked clarence better  than you do vincent       i acknowledge it   said belinda  colouring up to her temples   but that  time is entirely past  and i never look back to it       but if you were forced to look back to it  my dear   if clarence hervey  proposed for you   would not you cast a lingering look behind       let me beg of you  my dear lady delacour  as my friend   cried belinda   speaking and looking with great earnestness   let me beg of you to  forbear  do not use your powerful influence over my heart to make me  think of what i ought not to think  or do what i ought not to do  i have  permitted mr  vincent to address me  you cannot imagine that i am so  base as to treat him with duplicity  or that i consider him only as a   pis aller   no  i have treated  i will treat him honourably  he knows  exactly the state of my mind  he shall have a fair trial whether he can  win my love  the moment i am convinced that he cannot succeed  i will  tell him so decidedly  but if ever i should feel for him that affection  which is necessary for my happiness and his  i hope i shall without  fear  even of lady delacour s ridicule or displeasure  avow my  sentiments  and abide by my choice       my dear  i admire you   said lady delacour   but i am incorrigible   i am not fit to hear myself convinced  after all  i am impelled by the  genius of imprudence to tell you  that  in spite of mr  percival s cure  for  first loves   i consider love as a distemper that can be had but  once       as you acknowledge that you are not fit to hear yourself convinced    said belinda   i will not argue this point with you       but you will allow   said lady delacour   as it is said or sung in  cupid s calendar  that           un peu d amour  un peu de soin       menent souvent un coeur bien loin       and she broke off the conversation by singing that beautiful french air           chapter xxv     love me  love my dog       the only interest that honest people can take in the fate of rogues  is in their detection and punishment  the reader  then  will be so far  interested in the fate of mr  champfort  as to feel some satisfaction at  his being safely lodged in newgate  the circumstance which led to this  desirable catastrophe was the anonymous letter to mr  vincent  from  the first moment that marriott saw or heard of the letter  she was  convinced  she said  that  mr  champfort  was at the bottom of it     lady delacour was equally convinced that harriot freke was the author of  the epistle  and she supported her opinion by observing  that champfort  could neither write nor spell english  marriott and her lady were both  right  it was a joint  or rather a triplicate performance  champfort  in  conjunction with the stupid maid  furnished the intelligence  which mrs   freke manufactured  and when she had put the whole into proper style and  form  mr  champfort got her rough draught fairly copied at his leisure   and transmitted his copy to mr  vincent  now all this was discovered by  a very slight circumstance  the letter was copied by mr  champfort upon  a sheet of mourning paper  off which he thought that he had carefully  cut the edges  but one bit of the black edge remained  which did not  escape marriott s scrutinizing eye   lord bless my stars  my lady   she  exclaimed   this must be the paper  i mean may be the paper  that mr   champfort was cutting a quire of  the very day before miss portman left  town  it s a great while ago  but i remember it as well as if it was  yesterday  i saw a parcel of black jags of paper littering the place   and asked what had been going on  and was told  that it was only  mr  champfort who had been cutting some paper  which  to be sure  i  concluded my lord had given to him  having no further occasion for   as  my lord and you  my lady  were just going out of mourning at that time   as you may remember      lord delacour  when the paper was shown to him  recognized it  immediately by a private mark which he had put on the outside sheet of  a division of letter paper  which  indeed  he had never given to  champfort  but which he had missed about the time marriott mentioned   between the leaves of this paper his lordship had put  as it was often  his practice  some bank notes  they were notes but of small value  and  when he missed them he was easily persuaded by champfort that  as he had  been much intoxicated the preceding night  he had thrown them away with  some useless papers  he rummaged through his writing desk in vain  and  then gave up the search  it was true that on this very occasion he  gave champfort the remainder of some mourning paper  which he made no  scruple  therefore  of producing openly  certain that he could swear  to his own private mark  and that he could identify his notes by their  numbers   c   of which he had luckily a memorandum  lord delacour   enraged to find himself both robbed and duped by a favourite servant  in  whom he had placed implicit confidence  was effectually roused from his  natural indolence  he took such active and successful measures  that mr   champfort was committed to gaol  to take his trial for the robbery  to  make peace for himself  he confessed that he had been instigated by mrs   freke to get the anonymous letter written  this lady was now suffering  just punishment for her  frolics   and lady delacour thought her fallen  so much below indignation  that she advised belinda to take no manner  of notice of her conduct  except by simply returning the letter to  her  with  miss portman s  mr  vincent s  and lord and lady delacour s   compliments and thanks to  a sincere friend   who had been the means of  bringing villany to justice      so much for mrs  freke and mr  champfort  who  both together  scarcely  deserve an episode of ten lines     now to return to mr  vincent  animated by fresh hope  he pressed his  suit with belinda with all the ardour of his sanguine temper  though  little disposed to fear any future evil  especially in the midst of  present felicity  yet he was aware of the danger that might ensue to  him from clarence hervey s arrival  he was therefore impatient for the  intermediate day to pass  and it was with heartfelt joy that he saw the  carriages at last at the door  which were actually to convey them  to oakly park  mr  vincent  who had all the west indian love for  magnificence  had upon this occasion an extremely handsome equipage   lady delacour  though she was disappointed by clarence hervey s not  appearing  did not attempt to delay their departure  she contented  herself with leaving a note  to be delivered to him on his arrival   which  she still flattered herself  would induce him immediately to go  to harrowgate  the trunks were fastened upon the carriages  the imperial  was carrying out  marriott was full of a world of business  lord  delacour was looking at his horses as usual  helena was patting mr   vincent s great dog  and belinda was rallying her lover upon his taste  for  the pomp  pride  and circumstance  of glorious travelling  when an  express arrived from oakly park  it was to delay their journey for a  few weeks  mr  percival and lady anne wrote word  that they were  unexpectedly called from home by    lady delacour did not stay to read  by what  or by whom  she was so much delighted by this reprieve   mr  vincent bore the disappointment as well as could be expected   particularly when belinda observed  to comfort him  that  the mind  is its own place   and that hers  she believed  would be the same at  twickenham as at oakly park  nor did  she  give him any reason to regret  that she was not immediately under the influence of his own friends  the  dread of being unduly biassed by lady delacour  and the strong desire  belinda felt to act honourably by mr  vincent  to show him that she  was not trifling with his happiness  and that she was incapable of the  meanness of retaining a lover as a  pis aller   were motives which acted  more powerfully in his favour than all that even lady anne percival  could have looked or said  the contrast between the openness and  decision of his conduct towards her  and clarence hervey s vacillation  and mystery  the belief that mr  hervey was or ought to be attached to  another woman  the conviction that mr  vincent was strongly attached to  her  and that he possessed many of the good qualities essential to her  happiness  operated every day more and more strongly upon belinda s  mind     where was clarence hervey all this time  lady delacour  alas  could not  divine  she every morning was certain that he would appear that day  and  every night she was forced to acknowledge her mistake  no inquiries  and  she had made all that could be made  by address and perseverance  no  inquiries could clear up the mystery of virginia and mrs  ormond  and  her impatience to see her friend clarence every hour increased  she was  divided between her confidence in him and her affection for belinda   unwilling to give him up  yet afraid to injure her happiness  or to  offend her  by injudicious advice  and improper interference  one thing  kept lady delacour for some time in spirits  miss portman s assurance  that she would not bind herself by any promise or engagement to mr   vincent  even when decided in his favour  and that she should hold both  him and herself perfectly free till they were actually married  this was  according to lady anne and mr  percival s principles  and lady delacour  was never tired of expressing directly or indirectly her admiration of  the prudence and propriety of their doctrine     lady delacour recollected her own promise  to give her  sincere  congratulations to the victorious knight   and she endeavoured to treat  mr  vincent with impartiality  she was  however  now still less inclined  to like him  from a discovery  which she accidentally made  of his being  still upon good terms with  odious mrs  luttridge   helena  one morning   was playing with mr  vincent s large dog  of which he was excessively  fond  it was called juba  after his faithful servant      helena  my dear   said lady delacour   take care  don t trust your hand  in that creature s monstrous mouth       i can assure your ladyship   cried mr  vincent   that he is the very  quietest and best creature in the world       no doubt   said belinda  smiling   since he belongs to you  for you  know  as mr  percival tells you  every thing animate or inanimate that  is under your protection  you think must be the best of its kind in the  universe       but  really  juba is the best creature in the world   repeated mr   vincent  with great eagerness   juba is  without exception  the best  creature in the universe       juba  the dog  or juba  the man   said belinda   you know  they cannot  be both the best creatures in the universe       well  juba  the man  is the best man  and juba  the dog  is the best  dog  in the universe   said mr  vincent  laughing  with his usual  candour  at his own foible  when it was pointed out to him   but   seriously  lady delacour  you need not be in the least afraid to trust  miss delacour with this poor fellow  for  do you know  during a whole  month that i lent him to mrs  luttridge  at harrowgate  she used  constantly to let him sleep in the room with her  and now  whenever he  sees her  he licks her hand as gently as if he were a lapdog  and it  was but yesterday  when i had him there  she declared he was more gentle  than any lapdog in london      at the name of luttridge  lady delacour changed countenance  and she  continued silent for some time  mr  vincent  attributing her sudden  seriousness to dislike or fear of his dog  took him out of the room      my dear lady delacour   said belinda  observing that she still retained  an air of displeasure   i hope your antipathy to  odious mrs  luttridge   does not extend to every body who visits her       tout au contraire   cried lady delacour  starting from her reverie  and  assuming a playful manner   i have made a general gaol delivery of  all my old hatreds  and even odious mrs  luttridge  though a hardened  offender  must be included in this act of grace  so you need not fear  that mr  vincent should fall under my royal displeasure for consorting  with this state criminal  though i can t sympathize with him  i forgive  him  both for liking that great dog  and that little woman  especially   as i shrewdly suspect  that he likes the lady s e o table better than  the lady       e o table  good heavens  you do not imagine mr  vincent          nay  my dear  don t look so terribly alarmed  i assure you  i did not  mean to hint that there was any serious   improper  attachment to the e  o table  only a little flirtation  perhaps  to which his passion for you  has  doubtless  put a stop       i ll ask him the moment i see him   cried belinda   if he is fond of  play  i know he used to play at billiards at oakly park  but merely as  an amusement  games of address are not to be put upon a footing with  games of hazard       a man may  however  contrive to lose a good deal of money at billiards   as poor lord delacour can tell you  but i beseech you  my dear  do not  betray me to mr  vincent  ten to one i am mistaken  for his great dog  put me out of humour          but with such a doubt upon my mind  unsatisfied          it shall be satisfied  lord delacour shall make inquiries for me  lord  delacour  shall  make inquiries  did i say    will   i should have  said  if champfort had heard me  to what excellent account he might have  turned that unlucky  shall   what a nice grammarian a woman had need to  be  who would live well with a husband inferior to her in understanding   with a superior or an equal  she might use  shall  and  will  as  inaccurately as she pleases  glorious privilege  how i shall envy it  you  my dear belinda  but how can you ever hope to enjoy it  where is  your superior  where is your equal      mr  vincent  who had by this time seen his dog fed  which was one of his  daily pleasures  returned  and politely assured lady delacour that juba  should not again intrude  to make her peace with mr  vincent  and to  drive the e o table from belinda s thoughts  her ladyship now turned the  conversation from juba the dog  to juba the man  she talked of harriot  freke s phosphoric obeah woman  of whom  she said  she had heard an  account from miss portman  from thence she went on to the african  slave trade  by way of contrast  and she finished precisely where she  intended  and where mr  vincent could have wished  by praising a poem  called  the dying negro   which he had the preceding evening brought to  read to belinda  this praise was peculiarly agreeable  because he was  not perfectly sure of his own critical judgment  and his knowledge  of english literature was not as extensive as clarence hervey s  a  circumstance which lady delacour had discovered one morning  when they  went to see pope s famous villa at twickenham  flattered by her present  confirmation of his taste  mr  vincent readily complied with a request  to read the poem to belinda  they were all deeply engaged by the  charms of poetry  when they were suddenly interrupted by the entrance  of  clarence hervey     the book dropped from vincent s hand the instant that he heard his name   lady delacour s eyes sparkled with joy  belinda s colour rose  but her  countenance maintained an expression of calm dignity  mr  hervey  upon  his first entrance  appeared prepared to support an air of philosophic  composure  which forsook him before he had walked across the room  he  seemed overpowered by the kindness with which lady delacour received  his congratulations on her recovery  struck by the reserve of belinda s  manner  but not surprised  or displeased  at the sight of mr  vincent   on the contrary  he desired immediately to be introduced to him  with  the air of a man resolute to cultivate his friendship  provoked  and perplexed  lady delacour  in a tone of mingled reproach and  astonishment  exclaimed   though you have not done me the honour  mr   hervey  to take any other notice of my last letter  i am to understand   i presume  by the manner in which you desire me to introduce you to our  friend mr  vincent  that it has been received       received  good heavens  have not you had my answer   cried clarence  hervey  with a voice and look of extreme surprise and emotion   has not  your ladyship received a packet       i have had no packet  i have had no letter  mr  vincent  do me the  favour to ring the bell   cried lady delacour  eagerly   i ll know  this  instant  what s become of it       your ladyship must have thought me     and  as he spoke  his eye  involuntarily glanced towards belinda      no matter what i thought you   cried lady delacour  who forgave him  every thing for this single glance   if i did you a little injustice   clarence  when i was angry  you must forgive me  for  i assure you  i do  you a great deal of justice at other times       did any letter  any packet  come here for me  inquire  inquire   said  she  impatiently  to the servant who came in  no letter or packet was  to be heard of  it had been directed  mr  hervey now remembered  to her  ladyship s house in town  she gave orders to have it immediately sent  for  but scarcely had she given them  when  turning to mr  hervey  she  laughed and said   a very foolish compliment to you and your letter   for you certainly can speak as well as you can write  nay  better  i  think  though you don t write ill  neither  but you can tell me  in two  words  what in writing would take half a volume  leave this gentleman  and lady to  the dying negro   and let me hear your two words in lord  delacour s dressing room  if you please   said she  opening the door of  an adjoining apartment   lord delacour will not be jealous if he find  you tete a tete with me  i promise you  but you shall not be compelled   you look        i look   said mr  hervey  affecting to laugh   as if i felt the  impossibility of putting half a volume into two words  it is a long  story  and        and i must wait for the packet  whether i will or no  well  be it so    said lady delacour  struck with the extreme perturbation into which  he was thrown  she pressed him with no farther raillery  but instantly  attempted to change the conversation to general subjects     again she had recourse to  the dying negro   mr  vincent  to whom she  now addressed herself  said   for my part  i neither have  nor pretend  to have  much critical taste  but i admire in this poem the manly   energetic spirit of virtue which it breathes   from the poem  an easy  transition was made to the author  and clarence hervey  exerting himself  to join in the conversation  observed   that this writer  mr  day  was  an instance that genuine eloquence must spring from the heart  cicero  was certainly right   continued he  addressing himself to mr  vincent    in his definition of a great orator  to make it one of the first  requisites  that he should be a good man      mr  vincent coldly replied   this definition would exclude too many men  of superior talents  to be easily admitted       perhaps the appearance of virtue   said belinda   might  on many  occasions  succeed as well as the reality       yes  if the man be as good an actor as mr  hervey   said  lady  delacour   and if he suit  the action to the word    the word to the  action       belinda never raised her eyes whilst her ladyship uttered these words   mr  vincent was  or seemed to be  so deeply engaged in looking for  something in the book  which he held in his hand  that he could take no  farther part in the conversation  and a dead silence ensued     lady delacour  who was naturally impatient in the extreme  especially  in the vindication of her friends  could not bear to see  as she did by  belinda s countenance  that she had not forgotten marriott s story of  virginia st  pierre  and though her ladyship was convinced that the   packet  would clear up all mysteries  yet she could not endure that  even in the interim  poor clarence  should he unjustly suspected  nor  could she refrain from trying an expedient  which just occurred to her   to satisfy herself and every body present  she was the first to break  silence      to do ye justice  my friends  you are all good company this morning   mr  vincent is excusable  because he is in love  and belinda is  excusable  because  because  mr  hervey  pray help me to an excuse for  miss portman s stupidity  for i am dreadfully afraid of blundering out  the truth  but why do i ask  you  to help me  in your present condition   you seem totally unable to help yourself   not a word   run over the  common places of conversation  weather  fashion  scandal  dress  deaths    marriages   will none of these do  suppose  then  you were to entertain  me with other people s thoughts  since you have none of your own  unpacked  forfeit to arbitrary power   continued her ladyship  playfully  seizing mr  vincent s book   i have always observed that none submit  with so good a grace to arbitrary power from our sex as your true men of  spirit  who would shed the last drop of their blood to resist it from  one of their own  inconsistent creatures  the best of you  so read this  charming little poem to us  mr  hervey  will you      he was going to begin immediately  but lady delacour put her hand upon  the book  and stopped him      stay  though i am tyrannical  i will not be treacherous  i warn you   then  that i have imposed upon you a difficult  a dangerous task  if you  have any  sins unwhipt of justice   there are lines which i defy you to  read without faltering  listen to the preface      her ladyship began as follows      mr  day  indeed  retained during all the period of his life  as  might be expected from his character  a strong detestation of female  seduction    happening to see some verses  written by a young lady  on  a recent event of this nature  which was succeeded by a fatal  catastrophe  the unhappy young woman  who had been a victim to the  perfidy of a lover  overpowered by her sensibility of shame  having died  of a broken heart  he expresses his sympathy with the fair poetess in  the following manner      lady delacour paused  and fixed her eyes upon clarence hervey  he  with  all the appearance of conscious innocence  received the book  without  hesitation  from her hands  and read aloud the lines  to which she  pointed          swear by the dread avengers of the tomb       by all thy hopes  by death s tremendous gloom       that ne er by thee deceived  the tender maid      shall mourn her easy confidence betray d       nor weep in secret the triumphant art       with bitter anguish rankling in her heart       so may each blessing  which impartial fate      throws on the good  but snatches from the great       adorn thy favour d course with rays divine       and heaven s best gift  a virtuous love  be thine      mr  hervey read these lines with so much unaffected  unembarrassed  energy  that lady delacour could not help casting a triumphant look at  belinda  which said or seemed to say  you see i was right in my opinion  of clarence     had mr  vincent been left to his own observations  he would have seen  the simple truth  but he was alarmed and deceived by lady delacour s  imprudent expressions of joy  and by the significant looks that she  gave her friend miss portman  which seemed to be  looks of mutual  intelligence   he scarcely dared to turn his eyes toward his mistress   or upon him whom he thought his rival  but he kept them anxiously fixed  upon her ladyship  in whose face  as in a glass  he seemed to study  every thing that was passing      pray  have you ever played at chess  since we saw you last   said  lady delacour to clarence   i hope you do not forget that you are  my  knight   i do not forget it  i assure you  i own you as my knight to all  the world  in public and private  do not i  belinda      a dark cloud overspread mr  vincent s brow  he listened not to belinda s  answer  seized with a transport of jealousy  he darted at mr  hervey a  glance of mingled scorn and rage  and  after saying a few unintelligible  words to miss portman and lady delacour  he left the room     clarence hervey  who seemed afraid to trust himself longer with belinda   withdrew a few minutes afterward      my dear belinda   exclaimed lady delacour  the moment that he was out  of the room   how glad i am he is gone  that i may say all the good i  think of him  in the first place  clarence hervey loves you  never was i  so fully convinced of it as this day  why had we not that letter of his  sooner  that will explain all to us  but i ask for no explanation  i  ask for no letter  to confirm my opinion  my conviction  that he  loves   you  on this point i  cannot  be mistaken  he fondly loves you       he fondly loves her   yes  to be sure  i could have told you that news  long ago   cried the dowager lady boucher  who was in the room before  they were aware of her entrance  they had both been so eager  the one  listening  and the other speaking      fondly loves her   repeated the dowager   yes  and no secret  i  promise you  lady delacour   and then  turning to belinda  she began a  congratulatory speech  upon the report of her approaching marriage with  mr  vincent  belinda absolutely denied the truth of this report  but the  dowager continued   i distress you  i see  and it s quite out of rule   i am sensible  to speak in this sort of way  miss portman  but as i m an  old acquaintance  and an old friend  and an old woman  you ll excuse me   i can t help saying  i feel quite rejoiced at your meeting with such a  match   belinda again attempted to declare that she was not going to be  married  but the invincible dowager went on   every way eligible  and  every way agreeable  a charming young man  i hear  lady delacour  i  see i must only speak to you  or i shall make miss portman sink to the  centre of the earth  which i would not wish to do  especially at such a  critical moment as this  a charming young man  i hear  with a noble west  indian fortune  and a noble spirit  and well connected  and passionately  in love  no wonder  but i have done now  i promise you  i ll ask no  questions  so don t run away  miss portman  i ll ask no questions  i  promise you      to ensure the performance of the promise  lady delacour asked what news  there was in the world  this question  she knew  would keep the dowager  in delightful employment   i live quite out of the world here  but since  lady boucher has the charity to come to see me  we shall hear all the   secrets worth knowing   from the best authority       then  the first piece of news i have for you is  that my lord and my  lady delacour are absolutely reconciled  and that they are the happiest  couple that ever lived       all very true   replied lady delacour      true   repeated lady boucher   why  my dear lady delacour  you amaze  me   are you in earnest   was there ever any thing so provoking   there  have i been contradicting the report  wherever i went  for i was  convinced that the whole story was a mistake  and a fabrication       the history of the reformation might not be exact  but the reformation  itself your ladyship may depend upon  since you hear it from my own  lips       well  how amazing  how incredible   lord bless me  but your ladyship  certainly is not in earnest  for you look just the same  and speak just  in the same sort of way  i see no alteration  i confess       and what alteration  my good lady boucher  did you expect to see  did  you think that  by way of being exemplarily virtuous  i should  like  lady q      let my sentences come out of my mouth only at the rate of a  word a minute          like  minute  drops  from  off  the  eaves      or did you expect that  in hopes of being a pattern for the rising  generation  i should hold my features in penance  immoveably  thus  like  some of the poor ladies of antigua  who  after they have blistered their  faces all over  to get a fine complexion  are forced  whilst the new  skin is coming  to sit without speaking  smiling  or moving muscle or  feature  lest an indelible wrinkle should be the consequence      lady boucher was impatient to have this speech finished  for she had a  piece of news to tell   well   cried she   there s no knowing what to  believe or disbelieve  one hears so many strange reports  but i have a  piece of news for you  that you may all depend upon  i have one secret  worth knowing  i can tell your ladyship  and one  your ladyship and  miss portman  i m sure  will be rejoiced to hear  your friend  clarence  hervey  is going to be married       married  married   cried lady delacour      ay  ay  your ladyship may look as much astonished as you please  you  cannot be more so than i was when i heard it  clarence hervey  miss  portman  that was looked upon so completely  you know  as not a marrying  man  and now the last man upon earth that your ladyship would suspect of  marrying in this sort of way       in what sort of way   my dear belinda  how can you stand this fire    said lady delacour  placing a skreen  dexterously  to hide her face from  the dowager s observation      now only guess whom he is going to marry   continued lady boucher    whom do  you  guess  miss portman       an amiable woman  i should guess  from mr  hervey s general character    cried lady delacour      oh  an amiable woman  i take for granted  every woman is amiable of  course  as the newspapers tell us  when she is going to be married    said the dowager   an amiable woman  to be sure  but that means nothing   i have not had a guess from miss portman       from general character   belinda began  in a constrained voice      do not guess from general character  my dear belinda   interrupted  lady delacour   for there is no judging  in these cases  from general  character  of what people will like or dislike       then i will leave it to your ladyship to guess this time  if you  please   said belinda      you will neither of you guess till doomsday   cried the dowager   i  must tell you  mr  hervey s going to marry  in the strangest sort of  way   a girl that nobody knows  a daughter of a mr  hartley  the  father can give her a good fortune  it is true  but one should not have  supposed that fortune was an object with mr  hervey  who has such a  noble one of his own  it s really difficult to believe it       so difficult  that i find it quite impossible   said lady delacour   with an incredulous smile      depend upon it  my dear lady delacour   said the dowager  laying the  convincing weight of her arm upon her ladyship s   depend upon it  my  dear lady delacour  that my information is correct  guess whom i had it  from       willingly  but first let me tell you  that i have seen mr  hervey  within this half hour  and i never saw a man look less like a  bridegroom       indeed  well  i ve heard  too  that he didn t like the match  but what  a pity  when you saw him yourself this morning  that you didn t get all  the particulars out of him  but let him look like what he will  you ll  find that my information is perfectly correct  guess whom i had it  from  from mrs  margaret delacour  it was at her house that clarence  hervey first met mr  hartley  who  as i mentioned  is the father of the  young lady  there was a charming scene  and some romantic story  about  his finding the girl in a cottage  and calling her virginia something or  other  but i didn t clearly understand about that  however  this much is  certain  that the girl  as her father told mrs  delacour  is desperately  in love with mr  hervey  and they are to be married immediately  depend  upon it  you ll find my information correct  good morning to you  lord  bless me  now i recollect  i once heard that mr  hervey was a great  admirer of miss portman   said the dowager     the inquisitive dowager  whose curiosity was put upon a new scent   immediately fastened her eyes upon belinda s face  but from that she  could make out nothing  was it because she had not the best eyes  or  because there was nothing to be seen  to determine this question  she  looked through her glass  to take a clearer view  but lady delacour drew  off her attention  by suddenly exclaiming   my dear lady boucher   when you go back to town  do send me a bottle of concentrated anima of  quassia       ah  ah  have i made a convert of you at last   said the dowager  and   satisfied with the glory of this conversion  she departed      admire my knowledge of human nature  my dear belinda   said lady  delacour   now she will talk  at the next place she goes to  of nothing  but of my faith in anima of quassia  and she will forget to make a  gossiping story out of that most imprudent hint i gave her  about  clarence hervey s having been an admirer of yours       do not leave the room  belinda  i have a thousand things to say to you   my dear       excuse me  at present  my dear lady delacour  i am impatient to write a  few lines to mr  vincent  he went away        in a fit of jealousy  and i am glad of it       and i am sorry for it   said belinda   sorry that he should have so  little confidence in me as to feel jealousy without cause  without  sufficient cause  i should say  for certainly your ladyship gave pain   by the manner in which you received mr  hervey       lord  my dear  you would spoil any man upon earth  you could not act  more foolishly if the man were your husband  are you privately married  to him   if you be not  for my sake  for your own  for mr  vincent s  do  not write till we see the contents of clarence hervey s packet       it  can  make no alteration in what i write   said belinda      well  my dear  write what you please  but i only hope you will not send  your letter till the packet arrives       pardon me  i shall send it as soon as i possibly can  the  dear delight  of giving pain  does not suit my taste      lady delacour  as soon as she was left alone  began to reconsider the  dowager s story  notwithstanding her unbelieving smile  it alarmed her   for she could not refuse to give it some degree of credit  when she  learnt that mrs  margaret delacour was the authority from whom it came   mrs  delacour was a woman of scrupulous veracity  and rigid in her  dislike to gossiping  so that it was scarcely probable a report  originating with her  however it might be altered by the way  should  prove to be totally void of foundation  the name of virginia coincided  with sir philip baddely s hints  and with marriott s discoveries  these  circumstances considered  lady delacour knew not what opinion to form   and her eagerness to receive mr  hervey s packet every moment increased   she walked up and down the room  looked at her watch  fancied that it  had stopped  held it to her ear  ran the bell every quarter of an hour   to inquire whether the messenger was not  yet  come back  at last   the long expected packet arrived  she seized it  and hurried with it  immediately to belinda s room      clarence hervey s packet  my love   now  woe be to the person who  interrupts us   she bolted the door as she spoke    rolled an arm chair  to the fire   now for it   said she  seating herself   the devil upon  two sticks  if he were looking down upon me from the house top  or  champfort  who is the worse devil of the two  would  if he were peeping  through the keyhole  swear i was going to open a love letter  and so i  hope i am  now for it   cried she  breaking the seal      my dear friend   said belinda  laying her hand upon lady delacour s    before we open this packet  let me speak to you  whilst our minds are  calm       calm  it is the strangest time for your mind to be calm  but i must not  affront you by my incredulity  speak  then  but be quick  for i do not  pretend to be calm  it not being  thank my stars    mon metier d etre  philosophe    crack goes the last seal  speak now  or for ever after  hold your tongue  my  calm philosopher  of oakly park  but do you wish  me to attend to what you are going to say       yes   replied belinda  smiling   that is the usual wish of those who  speak       very true  and i can listen tolerably well  when i don t know what  people are going to say  but when i know it all beforehand  i have an  unfortunate habit of not being able to attend to one word  now  my dear   let me anticipate your speech  and if my anticipation be wrong  then you  shall rise to explain  and i will   said she   putting her finger on her  lips    listen to you  like harpocrates  without moving an eyelash      belinda  as the most certain way of being heard  consented to hear  before she spoke      i will tell you   pursued lady delacour   if not what you are going to  say to me  at least what you say to yourself  which is fully as much to  the purpose  you say to yourself   let this packet of clarence hervey  contain what it may  it comes too late  let him say  or let him do   tis  all the same to me  because   now for the reasoning   because things  have gone so far with mr  vincent  that lady anne percival and all the  world  at oakly park  will blame me  if i retract  in short   things  have gone so far  that i cannot recede  because   things have gone so  far    this is the rondeau of your argument  nay  hear me out  then you  shall have your turn  my dear  for an hour  if you please  let things  have gone ever so far  they can stop  and turn about again  cannot they   lady anne percival is your friend  of course can wish only for  your happiness  you think she is  the thing that s most uncommon  a  reasonable woman   then she cannot be angry with you for being happy  your own way  so i need not  as the orators say   labour this point any  more   now  as to your aunt  the fear of displeasing mrs  stanhope a  little more or less is not to be put in competition with the hope of  your happiness for life  especially as you have contrived to exist some  months in a state of utter excommunication from her favour  after all   you know she will not grieve for any thing but the loss of mr  vincent s  fortune  and mr  hervey s fortune might do as well  or almost as  well  at least  she may compound with her pride for the difference  by  considering that an english member of parliament is  in the eyes of the  world  the only eyes with which she sees   a better connexion than the  son of a west india planter  even though he may be a protege of lady  anne percival      spare me your indignation  my dear   what a look was there   reasoning  for mrs  stanhope  must not i reason as mrs  stanhope does   now i will  put this stronger still  suppose that you had actually acknowledged that  mr  vincent had got beyond esteem with you  suppose that you had in  due form consented to marry him  suppose that preparations were at this  moment making for the wedding  even in that desperate case i should say  to you  you are not a girl to marry because your wedding gown is made  up  some few guineas are thrown away  perhaps  do not throw away your  whole happiness after them  that would be sorry economy  trust me  my  dear  i should say  as i have to you  in time of need  or  if you fear  to be obliged to one who never was afraid of being obliged to you  ten  to one the preparations for  a  wedding  though not  the  wedding  may  be necessary immediately  no matter to mrs  franks who the bridegroom  may be  so that her bill be paid  she would not care the turning of a  feather whether it be paid by mrs  vincent or mrs  hervey  i hope i have  convinced  i am sure i have made you blush  my dear  and that is some  satisfaction  a blush at this moment is an earnest of victory  lo   triumphe  now i will open my packet  my hand shall not be held an  instant longer       i absolve you from the penance of hearing me for an hour  but i claim  your promise to attend to me for a few minutes  my dear friend   said  belinda   i thank you most sincerely for your kindness  and let me  assure you that i should not hesitate to accept from you any species of  obligation       thanks  thanks   there s a dear good girl   my own belinda       but indeed you totally misunderstand me  your reasoning        show me the fault of it  i challenge all the logic of all the  percivals       your reasoning is excellent  if your facts were not taken for granted   you have taken it for granted  that mr  hervey is in love with me       no   said lady delacour   i take nothing for granted  as you will find  when i open this packet       you have taken it for granted   continued belinda   that i am still  secretly attached to him  and you take it for granted that i am  restrained only by fear of lady anne percival  my aunt  and the world   from breaking off with mr  vincent  if you will read the letter  which  i was writing to him when you came into the room  perhaps you will be  convinced of your mistake       read a letter to mr  vincent at such a time as this  then i will go  and read my packet in my own room   cried lady delacour  rising hastily   with evident displeasure      not even your displeasure  my dear friend   said belinda   can alter  my determination to behave with consistency and openness towards mr   vincent  and i can bear your anger  for i know it arises from your  regard for me       i never loved you so little as at this instant  belinda       you will do me justice when you are cool       cool   repeated lady delacour  as she was about to leave the room   i  never wish to be as cool as you are  belinda  so  after all  you love  mr  vincent  you ll marry mr  vincent       i never said so   replied belinda   you have not read my letter  oh   lady delacour  at this instant  you should not reproach me       i did you injustice   cried lady delacour  as she now looked at  belinda s letter   send it  send it  you have said the very thing you  ought  and now sit down with me to this packet of clarence hervey s  be  just to him  as you are to mr  vincent  that s all i ask  give him a  fair hearing   now for it            chapter xxvi     virginia      clarence hervey s packet contained a history of his connexion with  virginia st  pierre     to save our hero from the charge of egotism  we shall relate the  principal circumstances in the third person     it was about a year before he had seen belinda that clarence hervey  returned from his travels  he had been in france just before the  revolution  when luxury and dissipation were at their height in paris   and when a universal spirit of licentious gallantry prevailed  some  circumstances in which he was personally interested disgusted him  strongly with the parisian belles  he felt that women who were full  of vanity  affectation  and artifice  whose tastes were perverted  and  whose feelings were depraved  were equally incapable of conferring or  enjoying real happiness  whilst this conviction was full in his mind  he  read the works of rousseau  this eloquent writer s sense made its full  impression upon clarence s understanding  and his declamations produced  more than their just effect upon an imagination naturally ardent  he was  charmed with the picture of sophia  when contrasted with the characters  of the women of the world with whom he had been disgusted  and he formed  the romantic project of educating a wife for himself  full of this idea   he returned to england  determined to carry his scheme immediately into  execution  but was some time delayed by the difficulty of finding  a proper object for his purpose  it was easy to meet with beauty  in distress  and ignorance in poverty  but it was difficult to find  simplicity without vulgarity  ingenuity without cunning  or even  ignorance without prejudice  it was difficult to meet with an  understanding totally uncultivated  yet likely to reward the labour of  late instruction  a heart wholly unpractised  yet full of sensibility   capable of all the enthusiasm of passion  the delicacy of sentiment  and  the firmness of rational constancy  it is not wonderful that mr  hervey   with such high expectations  should not immediately find them gratified   disappointed in his first search  he did not  however  relinquish his  design  and at length  by accident  he discovered  or thought that he  discovered  an object formed expressly for his purpose     one fine evening in autumn  as he was riding through the new forest   charmed with the picturesque beauties of the place  he turned out of  the beaten road  and struck into a fresh track  which he pursued with  increasing delight  till the setting sun reminded him that it was  necessary to postpone his farther reflections on forest scenery  and  that it was time to think of finding his way out of the wood  he was  now in the most retired part of the forest  and he saw no path to direct  him  but  as he stopped to consider which way he should turn  a dog  sprang from a thicket  barking furiously at his horse  his horse was  high spirited  but he was master of him  and he obliged the animal to  stand quietly till the dog  having barked himself hoarse  retreated  of his own accord  clarence watched to see which way he would go  and  followed him  in hopes of meeting with the person to whom he belonged   he kept his guide in sight  till he came into a beautiful glade  in the  midst of which was a neat but very small cottage  with numerous beehives  in the garden  surrounded by a profusion of rose trees which were in  full blow  this cultivated spot was strikingly contrasted with the  wildness of the surrounding scenery  as he came nearer  mr  hervey saw a  young girl watering the rose trees  which grew round the cottage  and  an old woman beside her filling a basket with the flowers  the old  woman was like most other old women  except that she had a remarkably  benevolent countenance  and an air that had been acquired in better  days  but the young girl did not appear to clarence like any other young  girl that he had ever seen  the setting sun shone upon her countenance   the wind blew aside the ringlets of her light hair  and the blush of  modesty overspread her cheeks when she looked up at the stranger  in  her large blue eyes there was an expression of artless sensibility with  which mr  hervey was so powerfully struck that he remained for some  moments silent  totally forgetting that he came to ask his way out of  the forest  his horse had made so little noise upon the soft grass  that  he was within a few yards of them before he was perceived by the old  woman  as soon as she saw him  she turned abruptly to the young girl   put the basket of roses into her hand  and bid her carry them into the  house  as she passed him  the girl  with a sweet innocent smile  held up  the basket to clarence  and offered him one of the roses      go in  rachel   go in  child   said the old woman  in so loud and  severe a tone  that both rachel and mr  hervey started  the basket was  overturned  and the roses all scattered upon the grass  clarence  though  he attempted some apology  was by no means concerned for the accident   as it detained rachel some instants longer to collect her flowers  and  gave him an opportunity of admiring her finely shaped hands and arms   and the ease and natural grace of her motions      go in  rachel   repeated the old woman  in a still more severe tone    leave the roses there  i can pick them up as well as you  child  go  in      the girl looked at the old woman with astonishment  her eyes filled with  tears  and throwing down the roses that she held in her hand  she said    i  am  going  grandmother   the door closed after her before clarence  recollected himself sufficiently to tell the old lady how he had lost  his way   c  her severity vanished  as soon as her grand daughter was  safe in the house  and with much readiness she showed him the road for  which he inquired     as soon  however  as it was in his power  he returned thither  for he  had taken such good note of the place  that he easily found his way to  the spot  which appeared to him a terrestrial paradise  as he descended  into the valley  he heard the humming of bees  but he saw no smoke  rising from the cottage chimney  no dog barked  no living creature was  to be seen  the house door was shut  the window shutters closed  all  was still  the place looked as if it had been deserted by all its  inhabitants  the roses had not been watered  many of them had shed their  leaves  and a basket half full of dead flowers was left in the middle of  the garden  clarence alighted  and tried the latch of the door  but it  was fastened  he listened  but heard no sound  he walked round to the  back of the house  a small lattice window was half open  and  as he went  toward it  he thought he heard a low moaning voice  he gently pulled  aside the curtain  and peeped in at the window  the room was darkened   his eyes had been dazzled by the sun  so that he could not  at first   see any object distinctly  but he heard the moaning repeated at  intervals  and a soft voice at last said       oh  speak to me   speak to me once again  only once  only once again   speak to me      the voice came from a corner of the room  to which he had not yet turned  his eyes  and as he drew aside more of the curtain  to let in more  light  a figure started up from the side of a bed  at which she had  been kneeling  and he saw the beautiful young girl  with her hair all  dishevelled  and the strongest expression of grief in her countenance   he asked if he could do her any service  she beckoned to him to come  in  and then  pointing to the bed  on which the old woman was stretched   said       she cannot speak to me  she cannot move one side  she has been so these  three days  but she is not dead  she is not dead      the poor creature had been struck with the palsy  as clarence went close  to the bed  she opened her eyes  and fixing them upon him  she stretched  out her withered hand  caught fast hold of her grand daughter  and  then raising herself  with a violent effort  she pronounced the word   begone   her face grew black  her features convulsed  and she sunk down  again in her bed  without power of utterance  clarence left the house  instantly  mounted his horse  and galloped to the next town for medical  assistance  the poor woman was so far recovered by a skilful apothecary   that she could  in a few days  articulate so as to be understood  she  knew that her end was approaching fast  and seemed piously resigned to  her fate  mr  hervey went constantly to see her  but  though grateful  to him for his humanity  and for the assistance he had procured for her   yet she appeared agitated when he was in the room  and frequently looked  at him and at her grand daughter with uncommon anxiety  at last  she  whispered something to the girl  who immediately left the room  and she  then beckoned to him to come closer to the arm chair  in which she was  seated      may be  sir   said she   you thought me out of my right mind the day  when i was lying on that bed  and said to you in such a peremptory tone    begone    it was all i could say then  and  in truth  i cannot speak  quite plain yet  nor ever shall again  but god s will be done  i had  only one thing to say to you  sir  about that poor girl of mine       clarence listened to her with eagerness  she paused  and then laying her  cold hand upon his  she looked up earnestly in his face  and continued    you are a fine young gentleman  and you look like a good gentleman  but  so did the man who broke the heart of her poor mother  her mother was  carried off from a boarding school  when she was scarcely sixteen  by a  wretch  who  after privately marrying her  would not own his marriage   stayed with her but two years  then went abroad  left his wife and his  infant  and has never been heard of since  my daughter died of a broken  heart  rachel was then between three and four years old  a beautiful  child  god forgive her father   god s will be done    she paused to  subdue her emotion  and then  with some difficulty  proceeded      my only comfort is  i have bred rachel up in innocence  i never sent  her to a boarding school  no  no  from the moment of her birth till now   i have kept her under my own eye  in this cottage she has lived with me   away from all the world  you are the first man she ever spoke to  the  first man who ever was within these doors  she is innocence itself   oh   sir  as you hope for mercy when you are as i am now  spare the innocence  of that poor child   never  never come here after her  when i am dead  and gone  consider  she is but a child  sir  god never made a better  creature  oh  promise me you will not be the ruin of my sweet innocent  girl  and i shall die in peace      clarence hervey was touched  he instantly made the promise required of  him  and  as nothing less would satisfy the poor dying woman  confirmed  it by a solemn oath      now i am easy   said she   quite easy  and may god bless you for it  in  the village here  there is a mrs  smith  a good farmer s wife  who knows  us well  she will see to have me decently buried  and then has promised  to sell all the little i have for my girl  and to take care of her  and  you ll never come near her more       i did not promise that   said hervey     the old woman again looked much disturbed      ah  good young gentleman   said she   take my advice  it will be best  for you both  if you see her again  you will love her  sir  you can t  help it  and if she sees you  poor thing  how innocently she smiled when  she gave you the rose   oh  sir  never come near her when i am gone  it  is too late for me now to get her out of your way  this night  i m sure   will be my last in this world  oh  promise me you will never come here  again       after the oath i have taken   replied clarence   that promise would be  unnecessary  trust to my honour       honour  oh  that was the word the gentleman said that betrayed her poor  mother  and left her afterwards to die    oh  sir  sir         the violent emotion that she felt was too much for her  she fell back  exhausted  never spoke more  and an hour afterwards she expired in the  arms of her grand daughter  the poor girl could not believe that she  had breathed her last  she made a sign to the surgeon  and to clarence  hervey  who stood beside her  to be silent  and listened  fancying that  the corpse would breathe again  then she kissed her cold lips  and the  shrivelled cheeks  and the eyelids that were closed for ever  she warmed  the dead fingers with her breath  she raised the heavy arm  and when  it fell she perceived there was no hope  she threw herself upon her  knees    she is dead   she exclaimed   and she has died without giving  me her blessing  she can never bless me again      they took her into the air  and clarence hervey sprinkled water upon  her face  it was a fine night  and the fresh air soon brought her to her  senses  he then said that he would leave her to the care of the surgeon   and ride to the village in search of that mrs  smith who had promised to  be her friend      and so  you  are going away from me  too   said she  and she burst into  tears  at the sight of these tears clarence turned away  and hurried  from her  he sent the woman from the village  but returned no more that  night     her simplicity  sensibility  and  perhaps more than he was aware  her  beauty  had pleased and touched him extremely  the idea of attaching a  perfectly pure  disinterested  unpractised heart  was delightful to his  imagination  the cultivation of her understanding  he thought  would  be an easy and a pleasing task  all difficulties vanished before his  sanguine hopes      sensibility   said he to himself   is the parent of great talents  and great virtues  and evidently she possesses natural feeling in  an uncommon degree  it shall be developed with skill  patience  and  delicacy  and i will deserve before i claim my reward      the next day he returned to the cottage  accompanied by an elderly lady   a mrs  ormond  the same lady who afterward  to marriott s prejudiced  eyes  had appeared  more like a dragon than any thing else   but who  to  this simple  unsuspicious girl  seemed like what she really was  a truly  good natured  benevolent woman  she consented  most readily  to put  herself under the protection of mrs  ormond   provided mrs  smith would  give her leave   there was no difficulty in persuading mrs  smith that  it was for her advantage  mrs  smith  who was a plain farmer s wife   told all that she knew of rachel s history  but all that she knew was  little  she had heard only hints at odd times from the old woman  these  agreed perfectly with what mr  hervey had already heard      the  old gentlewoman    said mrs  smith   as i believe i should call  her by rights  has lived in the forest there  where you found her   these many a year  she earned her subsistence by tending bees and making  rose water  she was a good soul  but very particular  especially about  her grand daughter  which  considering all things  one cannot blame her  for  she often told me she would never put rachel to a boarding school   which i approved  seeing she had no fortune  and it is the ruin of  girls  to my mind  to be bred above their means  as it was of her  mother  sir  then she would never teach rachel to write  for fear she  should take to scrawling nonsense of love letters  as her mother did  before her  now  sir  this i approved too  for i don t much mind about  book learning myself  and i even thought it would have been as well if  the girl had not learnt to read  but that she did learn  and was  always fond of  and i m sure it was more plague than use too to her  grandmother  for she was as particular about the books that the girl was  to read as about all the rest  she went farther than all that  sir  for  she never would let the girl speak to a man  not a man ever entered the  doors of the house       so she told me       and she told you true enough  but there  i thought  she was quite  wrong  for seeing the girl must  some time or other  speak to men   where was the use of her not learning to do it properly   lord  ma am    continued mrs  smith  addressing herself to mrs  ormond   lord  ma am   though it is a sin to be remembering so much of the particularities  of the dead  i must say there never was an old lady who had more  scrupulosities than the deceased  i verily thought  one day  she would  have gone into fits about a picture of a man  that rachel lit upon by  accident  as if a picture had any sense to hurt a body  now if it had  been one of your naked pictures  there might have been some delicacy in  her dislike to it  but it was no such thing  but a very proper picture      a picture  ma am  of a young sea officer  in his full uniform  quite  proper  ma am  it was his mother that left it with me  and i had it  always in my own room  and the girl saw it  and was mightily taken with  it  being the first thing of the kind she had ever lit upon  and the  old lady comes in   and took on   till i verily thought she was crazed   lord  i really could not but laugh  but i checked myself  when the poor  old soul s eyes filled with tears  which made me know she was thinking  of her daughter that was dead  when i thought on the cause of  her particularity about rachel  i could not laugh any more at her  strangeness      i promised the good lady that day  in case of her death  to take care  of her grand daughter  and i thought in my own mind that  in time to  come  if one of my boys should take a fancy to her  i should make no  objections  because she was always a good  modest behaved girl  and  i m  sure  would make a good wife  though too delicate for hard country work   but  as it pleases god to send you  madam  and the good gentleman  to  take the charge of her off my hands  i am content it should be so  and i  will sell every thing here for her honestly  and bring it to you  madam   for poor rachel      there was nothing that rachel was anxious to carry away with her but  a little bullfinch  of which she was very fond  one  and but one   circumstance about rachel stopped the current of clarence hervey s  imagination  and this  consequently  was excessively disagreeable to  him  her name  the name of rachel he could not endure  and he thought it  so unsuited to her  that he could scarcely believe it belonged to her   he consequently resolved to change it as soon as possible  the first  time that he beheld her  he was struck with the idea that she resembled  the description of virginia in m  de st  pierre s celebrated romance   and by this name he always called her  from the hour that she quitted  her cottage     mrs  ormond  the lady whom he had engaged to take care of his virginia   was a widow  the mother of a gentleman who had been his tutor at  college  her son died  and left her in such narrow circumstances  that  she was obliged to apply to her friends for pecuniary assistance     mr  hervey had been liberal in his contributions  from his childhood he  had known her worth  and her attachment to him was blended with the most  profound respect  she was not a woman of superior abilities  or of  much information  but her excellent temper and gentle disposition won  affection  though she had not any talents to excite admiration  mr   hervey had perfect confidence in her integrity  he believed that she  would exactly comply with his directions  and he thought that her want  of literature and ingenuity could easily be supplied by his own care and  instructions  he took a house for her and his fair pupil at windsor  and  he exacted a solemn promise that she would neither receive nor pay any  visits  virginia was thus secluded from all intercourse with the world   she saw no one but mrs  ormond  clarence hervey  and mr  moreton  an  elderly clergyman  whom mr  hervey engaged to attend every sunday to  read prayers for them at home  virginia never expressed the slightest  curiosity to see any other persons  or any thing beyond the walls of  the garden that belonged to the house in which she lived  her present  retirement was not greater than that to which she had long been  accustomed  and consequently she did not feel her seclusion from the  world as any restraint  with the circumstances that were altered in her  situation she seemed neither to be dazzled nor charmed  the objects  of convenience or luxury that were new to her she looked upon with  indifference  but with any thing that reminded her of her former way of  life  and of her grandmother s cottage  she was delighted     one day mr  hervey asked her  whether she should like better to return  to that cottage  or to remain where she was  he trembled for her answer   she innocently replied   i should like best to go back to the cottage   if you would go with me  but i would rather stay here with you than live  there without you      clarence was touched and flattered by this artless answer  and for some  time he discovered every day fresh indications  as he thought  of virtue  and abilities in his charming pupil  her indifference to objects of show  and ornament appeared to him an indisputable proof of her magnanimity   and of the superiority of her unprejudiced mind  what a difference   thought he  between this child of nature and the frivolous   sophisticated slaves of art     to try and prove the simplicity of her taste  and the purity of her  mind  he once presented to her a pair of diamond earrings and a moss  rosebud  and asked her to take whichever she liked best  she eagerly  snatched the rose  crying   oh  it puts me in mind of the cottage   how  sweet it smells      she placed it in her bosom  and then  looking at the diamonds  said    they are pretty  sparkling things  what are they  of what use are  they   and she looked with more curiosity and admiration at the manner  in which the earring shut and opened than at the diamonds  clarence was  charmed with her  when mrs  ormond told her that these things were to  hang in her ears  she laughed and said   how  how can i make them hang       have you never observed that i wear earrings   said mrs  ormond      ay  but yours are not like these  and  let me look  i never saw how you  fastened them  let me look  oh  you have holes in your ears  but i have  none in mine      mrs  ormond told her that holes could easily be made in her ears  by  running a steel pin through them  she shrunk back  defending her  ear with one hand  and pushing the diamonds from her with the other   exclaiming   oh  no  no   unless   added she  changing her tone  and  turning to clarence   unless you wish it   if you bid me  i will      clarence was scarcely master of himself at this instant  and it was with  the utmost difficulty that he could reply to her with that dispassionate  calmness which became his situation and hers  and yet there was more of  ignorance and timidity  perhaps  than of sound sense or philosophy  in virginia s indifference to diamonds  she did not consider them as  ornaments that would confer distinction upon their possessor  because  she was ignorant of the value affixed to them by society  isolated in  the world  she had no excitements to the love of finery  no competition   no means of comparison  or opportunities of display  diamonds were  consequently as useless to her as guineas were to robinson crusoe on  his desert island  it could not justly be said that he was free from  avarice  because he set no value on the gold  or that she was free from  vanity  because she rejected the diamonds  these reflections could not  possibly have escaped a man of clarence hervey s abilities  had he not  been engaged in defence of a favourite system of education  or if his  pupil had not been quite so handsome  virginia s absolute ignorance  of the world frequently gave an air of originality to her most  trivial observations  which made her appear at once interesting and  entertaining  all her ideas of happiness were confined to the life she  had led during her childhood  and as she had accidentally lived in  a beautiful situation in the new forest  she appeared to have an  instinctive taste for the beauties of nature  and for what we call the  picturesque  this taste mr  hervey perceived  whenever he showed  her prints and drawings  and it was a fresh source of delight and  self complacency to him  all that was amiable or estimable in virginia  had a double charm  from the secret sense of his penetration  in having  discovered and appreciated the treasure  the affections of this innocent  girl had no object but himself and mrs  ormond  and they were  strong  perhaps  in proportion as they were concentrated  the artless  familiarity of her manner  and her unsuspicious confidence  amounting  almost to credulity  had irresistible power over mr  hervey s mind  he  felt them as appeals at once to his tenderness and his generosity  he  treated her with the utmost delicacy  and his oath was never absent from  his mind  but he felt proudly convinced  that if he had not been bound  by any such solemn engagement  no temptation could have made him deceive  and betray confiding innocence     conscious that his views were honourable  anticipating the generous  pleasure he should have in showing his superiority to all mercenary  considerations and worldly prejudices  in the choice of a wife   he indulged  with a species of pride  his increasing attachment to  virginia  but he was not sensible of the rapid progress of the passion   till he was suddenly awakened by a few simple observations of mrs   ormond      this is virginia s birthday  she tells me she is seventeen to day       seventeen   is she only seventeen   cried clarence  with a mixture of  surprise and disappointment in his countenance   only seventeen  why she  is but a child still       quite a child   said mrs  ormond   and so much the better       so much the worse  i think   said clarence   but are you sure she s  only seventeen   she must be mistaken  she must be eighteen  at least       god forbid       god forbid   why  mrs  ormond       because  you know  we have a year more before us       that may be a very satisfactory prospect to you   said mr  hervey   smiling      and to you  surely   said mrs  ormond   for  i suppose  you would be  glad that your wife should  at least  know the common things that every  body knows       as to that   said clarence   i should be glad that my wife were  ignorant of what  every body knows   nothing is so tiresome to a man of  any taste or abilities as  what every body knows   i am rather desirous  to have a wife who has an uncommon than a common understanding       but you would choose  would not you   said mrs  ormond  hesitating with  an air of great deference   that your wife should know how to write       to be sure   replied clarence  colouring   does not virginia know how  to write       how should she   said mrs  ormond   it is no fault of hers  poor  girl  she was never taught  you know it was her grandmother s notion  that she should not learn to write  lest she should write love letters       but  you  promised that she should be taught to write  and i trusted to  you  mrs  ormond       she has been here only two months  and all that time  i am sure  i have  done every thing in my power  but when a person comes to be sixteen or  seventeen  it is up hill work       i will teach her myself   cried clarence   i am sure she may be taught  any thing       by you   said mrs  ormond  smiling   but not by me       you have no doubts of her capacity  surely       i am no judge of capacity  especially of the capacity of those i love   and i am grown very fond of virginia  she is a charming  open hearted   simple  affectionate creature  i rather think it is from indolence that  she does not learn  and not from want of abilities       all indolence arises from want of excitement   said clarence   if she  had proper motives  she would conquer her indolence       why  i dare say  if i were to tell her that she would never have a  letter from mr  hervey till she is able to write an answer  she would  learn to write very expeditiously  but i thought that would not be a  proper motive  because you forbade me to tell her your future views  and  indeed it would be highly imprudent  on your account  as well as hers   to give her any hint of that kind  because you might change your mind   before she s old enough for you to think of her seriously  and then  you would not know what to do with her  and after entertaining hopes  of becoming your wife  she would be miserable  i am sure  with that  affectionate tender heart of hers  if you were to leave her  now that  she knows nothing of the matter  we are all safe  and as we should be      though clarence hervey did not at this time foresee any great  probability of his changing his mind  yet he felt the good sense and  justice of mrs  ormond s suggestions  and he was alarmed to perceive  that his mind had been so intoxicated as to suffer such obvious  reflections to escape his attention  mrs  ormond  a woman whom he had  been accustomed to consider as far his inferior in capacity  he now felt  was superior to him in prudence  merely because she was undisturbed by  passion  he resolved to master his own mind  to consider that it was  not a mistress  but a wife he wanted in virginia  that a wife without  capacity or without literature could never be a companion suited to him   let her beauty or sensibility be ever so exquisite and captivating  the  happiness of his life and of hers were at stake  and every motive of  prudence and delicacy called upon him to command his affections  he  was  however  still sanguine in his expectations from virginia s  understanding  and from his own power of developing her capacity  he  made several attempts  with the greatest skill and patience  and his  fair pupil  though she did not by any means equal his hopes  astonished  mrs  ormond by her comparatively rapid progress      i always believed that you could make her any thing you pleased   said  she   you are a tutor who can work miracles with virginia       i see no miracles   replied clarence   i am conscious of no such power   i should be sorry to possess any such influence  until i am sure that it  would be for our mutual happiness      mr  hervey then conjured mrs  ormond  by all her attachment to him and  to her pupil  never to give virginia the most distant idea that he had  any intentions of making her his wife  she promised to do all that was  in her power to keep this secret  but she could not help observing that  it had already been betrayed  as plainly as looks could speak  by mr   hervey himself  clarence in vain endeavoured to exculpate himself from  this charge  mrs  ormond brought to his recollection so many instances  of his indiscretion  that it was substantiated even in his own  judgment  and he was amazed to find that all the time he had put so much  constraint upon his inclinations  he had  nevertheless  so obviously  betrayed them  his surprise  however  was at this time unmixed with any  painful regret  he did not foresee the probability that he should change  his mind  and notwithstanding mrs  ormond assured him that virginia s  sensibility had increased  he was persuaded that she was mistaken  and  that his pupil s heart and imagination were yet untouched  the innocent  openness with which she expressed her affection for him confirmed him   he said  in his opinion  to do him justice  clarence had none of the  presumption which too often characterizes men who have been successful   as it is called  with the fair sex  his acquaintance with women had  increased his persuasion that it is difficult to excite genuine love  in the heart  and with respect to himself  he was upon this subject  astonishingly incredulous  it was scarcely possible to convince him that  he was beloved     mrs  ormond  piqued upon this subject  determined to ascertain more  decisively her pupil s sentiments      my dear   said she  one day to virginia  who was feeding her bullfinch    i do believe you are fonder of that bird than of any thing in the  world  fonder of it  i am sure  than of me       oh  you cannot think so   said virginia  with an affectionate smile      well  fonder than you are of mr  hervey  you will allow  at least       no  indeed   cried she  eagerly   how can you think me so foolish  so  childish  so ungrateful  as to prefer a little worthless bird to  him     the bullfinch began to sing so loud at this instant  that her  enthusiastic speech was stopped    my pretty bird   said she  as it  perched upon her hand   i love you very much  but if mr  hervey were to  ask it  to wish it  i would open that window  and let you fly  yes  and  bid you fly away far from me for ever  perhaps he does wish it   does  he   did he tell you so   cried she  looking earnestly in mrs  ormond s  face  as she moved towards the window     mrs  ormond put her hand upon the sash  as virginia was going to throw  it up       gently  gently  my love  whither is your imagination carrying you       i thought  something  by your look   said virginia  blushing      and i thought  something   my dear virginia   said mrs  ormond   smiling      what did you think   what  could  you think       i cannot  i mean  i would rather not at present tell you  but do not  look so grave  i will tell you some time or other  if you cannot guess      virginia was silent  and stood abashed      i am sure  my sweet girl   said mrs  ormond   i do not mean  by any  thing i said  to confuse or blame you  it is very natural that you  should be grateful to mr  hervey  and that you should admire  and   to a  certain degree  love  him      virginia looked up delighted  yet with some hesitation in her manner      he is  indeed   said mrs  ormond   one of the first of human beings   such even  i  have always thought him  and i am sure i like you the  better  my dear  for your sensibility   said she  kissing virginia as  she spoke   only we must take care of it  or this tenderness might go  too far       how so   said virginia  returning her caresses with fondness   can i  love you and mr  hervey too much       not me       nor him  i m sure  he is so good  so very good  i am afraid that i do  not love him  enough    said she  sighing   i love him enough when he  is absent  but not when he is present  when he is near i feel a sort of  fear mixed with my love  i wish to please him very much  but i should  not quite like that he should show his love for me as you do  as you did  just now       my dear  it would not be proper that he should  you are quite right not  to wish it       am i  i was afraid that it was a sign of my not liking him as much as i  ought       ah  my poor child  you love him full as much as you ought       do you think so  i am glad of it   said virginia  with a look of such  confiding simplicity  that her friend was touched to the heart      i do think so  my love   said mrs  ormond   and i hope i shall never  be sorry for it  nor you either  but it is not proper that we should say  any more upon this subject now  where are your drawings  where is your  writing  my dear  we must get forward with these things as fast as we  can  that is the way to please mr  hervey  i can tell you      confirmed by this conversation in her own opinion  mrs  ormond was  satisfied  from delicacy to her pupil  she did not repeat all that had  passed to mr  hervey  resolving to wait till the  proper  moment   she  is too young and too childish for him to think of marrying her yet   for a year or two   thought she   and it is better to repress her  sensibility till her education is more finished  by that time mr  hervey  will find out his mistake      in the mean time she could not help thinking that he was blind  for he  continued steady in his belief of virginia s indifference     to dissipate his own mind  and to give time for the development of hers   he now  according to his resolution  left his pupil to the care of mrs   ormond  and mixed as much as possible in gay and fashionable company  it  was at this period that he renewed his acquaintance with lady delacour   whom he had seen and admired before he went abroad  he found that his  gallantry  on the famous day of the battle between the turkeys and pigs   was still remembered with gratitude by her ladyship  she received him  with marked courtesy  and he soon became a constant visitor at her  house  her wit entertained  her eloquence charmed him  and he followed   admired  and  gallanted  her  without scruple  for he considered  her merely as a coquette  who preferred the glory of conquest to the  security of reputation  with such a woman he thought he could amuse  himself without danger  and he every where appeared the foremost in the  public train of her ladyship s admirers  he soon discovered  however   that her talents were far superior to what are necessary for playing the  part of a fine lady  his visits became more and more agreeable to him   and he was glad to feel  that  by dividing his attention  his passion  for virginia insensibly diminished  or  as he said to himself  became  more reasonable  in conversing with lady delacour  his faculties were  always called into full play  in talking to virginia  his understanding  was passive  he perceived that a large proportion of his intellectual  powers  and of his knowledge  was absolutely useless to him in her  company  and this did not raise her either in his love or esteem  her  simplicity and naivete  however  sometimes relieved him  after he had  been fatigued by the extravagant gaiety and  glare  of her ladyship s  manners  and he reflected that the coquetry which amused him in an  acquaintance would be odious in a wife  the perfect innocence of  virginia promised security to his domestic happiness  and he did not  change his views  though he was less eager for the period of their  accomplishment   i cannot expect every thing that is desirable   said he  to himself   a more brilliant character than virginia s would excite my  admiration  but could not command my confidence      it was whilst his mind was in this situation that he became acquainted  with belinda  at first  the idea of her having been educated by the  match making mrs  stanhope prejudiced him against her  but as he  had opportunities of observing her conduct  this prepossession was  conquered  and when she had secured his esteem  he could no longer  resist her power over his heart  in comparison with belinda  virginia  appeared to him but an insipid  though innocent child  the one he  found was his equal  the other his inferior  the one he saw could be  a companion  a friend to him for life  the other would merely be  his pupil  or his plaything  belinda had cultivated taste  an active  understanding  a knowledge of literature  the power and the habit of  conducting herself  virginia was ignorant and indolent  she had  few ideas  and no wish to extend her knowledge  she was so entirely  unacquainted with the world  that it was absolutely impossible she could  conduct herself with that discretion  which must be the combined result  of reasoning and experience  mr  hervey had felt gratuitous confidence  in virginia s innocence  but on belinda s prudence  which he had  opportunities of seeing tried  he gradually learned to feel a different  and a higher species of reliance  which it is neither in our power to  bestow nor to refuse  the virtues of virginia sprang from sentiment   those of belinda from reason     clarence  whilst he made all these comparisons  became every day more  wisely and more fondly attached to belinda  and at length he became  desirous to change the nature of his connexion with virginia  and to  appear to her only in the light of a friend or a benefactor  he thought  of giving her a suitable fortune and of leaving her under the care of  mrs  ormond  till some method of establishing her in the world should  occur  unfortunately  just at the time when mr  hervey formed this plan   and before it was communicated to mrs  ormond  difficulties arose which  prevented him from putting it into execution     whilst he had been engaged in the gay world at lady delacour s  his  pupil had necessarily been left much to the management of mrs  ormond   this lady  with the best possible intentions  had not that reach of mind  and variety of resource necessary to direct the exquisite sensibility  and ardent imagination of virginia  the solitude in which she lived  added to the difficulty of the task  without companions to interest  her social affections  without real objects to occupy her senses  and understanding  virginia s mind was either perfectly indolent  or   exalted  by romantic views  and visionary ideas of happiness  as she  had never seen any thing of society  all her notions were drawn from  books  the severe restrictions which her grandmother had early laid upon  the choice of these seemed to have awakened her curiosity  and to have  increased her appetite for books  it was insatiable  reading  indeed   was now almost her only pleasure  for mrs  ormond s conversation was  seldom entertaining  and virginia had no longer those occupations which  filled a portion of her day at the cottage     mr  hervey had cautioned mrs  ormond against putting  common  novels  into her hands  but he made no objection to romances  these  he thought   breathed a spirit favourable to female virtue  exalted the respect for  chastity  and inspired enthusiastic admiration of honour  generosity   truth  and all the noble qualities which dignify human nature  virginia  devoured these romances with the greatest eagerness  and mrs  ormond   who found her a prey to ennui when her fancy was not amused  indulged  her taste  yet she strongly suspected that they contributed to increase  her passion for the only man who could  in her imagination  represent a  hero     one night virginia found  in mrs  ormond s room  a volume of st   pierre s paul and virginia  she knew that her own name had been taken  from this romance  mr  hervey had her picture painted in this character   and these circumstances strongly excited her curiosity to read the book   mrs  ormond could not refuse to let her have it  for  though it was not  an ancient romance  it did not exactly come under the description of  a common novel  and mr  hervey was not at hand to give his advice   virginia sat down instantly to her volume  and never stirred from the  spot till she had nearly finished it      what is it that strikes your fancy so much  what are you considering so  deeply  my love   said mrs  ormond  observing  that she seemed lost  in thought   let us see  my dear   continued she  offering to take the  hook  which hung from her hand  virginia started from her reverie  but  held the volume fast    will not you let me read along with you   said  mrs  ormond   won t you let me share your pleasure       it was not pleasure that i felt  i believe   said virginia   i would  rather you should not see just that particular part that i was reading   and yet  if you desire it   added she  resigning the book reluctantly      what can make you so much afraid of me  my sweet girl       i am not afraid of you  but  of myself   said virginia  sighing     mrs  ormond read the following passage       she thought of paul s friendship  more pure than the waters   of the fountain  stronger than the united palms  and sweeter than   the perfume of flowers  and these images  in night and in   solitude  gave double force to the passion which she nourished   in her heart  she suddenly left the dangerous shades  and   went to her mother  to seek protection against herself  she   wished to reveal her distress to her  she pressed her hands  and   the name of paul was on her lips  but the oppression of her   heart took away all utterance  and  laying her head upon her   mother s bosom  she only wept       and am i not a mother to you  my beloved virginia   said mrs  ormond    though i cannot express my affection in such charming language as this   yet  believe me  no mother was ever fonder of a child      virginia threw her arms round mrs  ormond  and laid her head upon her  friend s bosom  as if she wished to realize the illusion  and to be the  virginia of whom she had been reading      i know all you think  and all you feel  i know   whispered mrs  ormond    the name that is on  your  lips       no  indeed  you do not  you cannot   cried virginia  suddenly raising  her head  and looking up in mrs  ormond s face  with surprise and  timidity   how could you possibly know  all  my thoughts and feelings  i  never told them to you  for  indeed  i have only confused ideas  floating in my imagination from the books i have been reading  i do not  distinctly know my own feelings       this is all very natural  and a proof of your perfect innocence and  simplicity  my child  but why did the passage you were reading just now  strike you so much       i was only considering   said virginia   whether it was the description  of  love       and your heart told you that it was       i don t know   said she  sighing   but of this i am certain  that i had  not the name  which you were thinking of  upon my lips      ah  thought mrs  ormond  she has not forgotten how i checked her  sensibility some time ago  poor girl  she is become afraid of me  and i  have taught her to dissemble  but she betrays herself every moment      my dear   said mrs  ormond   you need not fear me  i cannot blame  you  in your situation  it is impossible that you could help loving mr   hervey       is it       yes  quite impossible  so do not blame yourself for it       no  i do not blame myself for that  i only blame myself for not loving  him  enough   as i told you once before       yes  my dear  and the oftener you tell me so  the more i am convinced  of your affection  it is one of the strongest symptoms of love  that we  are unconscious of its extent  we fancy that we can never do too much  for the beloved object       that is exactly what i feel about mr  hervey       that we can never love him enough       ah  that is precisely what i feel for mr  hervey       and what you ought  i mean  what it is natural you should feel  and  what he will himself  i hope  indeed i dare say  some time or other  wish  and be glad that you should feel       some time or other  does not he wish it now       i  he  my dear  what a question is that  and how shall i answer it  we  must judge of what he feels by what he expresses  when he expresses love  for you  it will then be the time to show yours for him       he has always expressed love for me  i think   said virginia   always   till lately   continued she   but lately he has been away so much  and  when he comes home  he does not look so well pleased  so that i was  afraid he was angry with me  and that he thought me ungrateful       oh  my love  do not torment yourself with these vain fears  and yet i  know that you cannot help it       since you are so kind  so very kind to me   said virginia   i will tell  you all my fears and doubts  but it is late  there  the clock struck  one  i will not keep you up       i am not at all sleepy   said the indulgent mrs  ormond      nor i   said virginia      now  then   said mrs  ormond   for these doubts and fears       i was afraid that  perhaps  mr  hervey would be angry if he knew that i  thought of any thing in the world but him       of what else do you think   of nothing else from morning till night   that i can see       ah  then you do not see into my mind  in the daytime often think of  those heroes  those charming heroes  that i read of in the books you  have given me       to be sure you do       and is not that wrong  would not mr  hervey be displeased if he knew  it       why should he       because they are not quite like him  i love some of them better than i  do him  and he might think that  ungrateful       how naturally love inspires the idea of jealousy  thought mrs  ormond    my dear   said she   you carry your ideas of delicacy and gratitude to  an extreme  but it is very natural you should  however  you need not  be afraid  mr  hervey cannot be jealous of those charming heroes  that  never existed  though they are not quite like him       i am very glad that he would not think me ungrateful  but if he knew  that i dream of them sometimes       he would think you dreamed  as all people do  of what they think of in  the daytime       and he would not be angry  i am very glad of it  but i once saw a  picture        i know you did  well   said mrs  ormond   and your grandmother was  frightened because it was the picture of a man  hey  if she was not your  grandmother  i should say that she was a simpleton  i assure you  mr   hervey is not like her  if that is what you mean to ask  he would not be  angry at your having seen fifty pictures       i am glad of it  but i see it very often in my dreams       well  if you had seen more pictures  you would not see this so often   it was the first you ever saw  and very naturally you remember it  mr   hervey would not be angry at that   said mrs  ormond  laughing      but sometimes  in my dreams  it speaks to me       and what does it say       the same sort of things that those heroes i read of say to their  mistresses       and do you never  in your dreams  hear mr  hervey say this sort of  things       no       and do you never see mr  hervey in these dreams       sometimes  but he does not speak to me  he does not look at me with the  same sort of tenderness  and he does not throw himself at my feet       no  because he has never done all this in reality       no  and i wonder how i come to dream of such things       so do i  but you have read and thought of them  it is plain  now go  to sleep  there s my good girl  that is the best thing you can do at  present  go to sleep      it was not long after this conversation that sir philip baddely and mr   rochfort scaled the garden wall  to obtain a sight of clarence hervey s  mistress  virginia was astonished  terrified  and disgusted  by their  appearance  they seemed to her a species of animals for which she had  no name  and of which she had no prototype in her imagination  that they  were men she saw  but they were clearly not  clarence herveys   they  bore still less resemblance to the courteous knights of chivalry  their  language was so different from any of the books she had read  and any of  the conversations she had heard  that they were scarcely intelligible   after they had forced themselves into her presence  they did not scruple  to address her in the most unceremonious manner  amongst other rude  things  they said   damme  my pretty dear  you cannot love the man that  keeps you prisoner in this manner  hey  damme  you d better come and  live with one of us  you can t love this tyrant of a fellow       he is not a tyrant  i  do  love him as much as i detest you   cried  virginia  shrinking from him with looks of horror      damme  good actress  put her on the stage when he is tired of her  so  you won t come with us   good bye  till we see you again  you re right   my girl  to be upon your good behaviour  may be you may get him to marry  you  child      virginia  upon hearing this speech  turned from the man who insulted  her with a degree of haughty indignation  of which her gentle nature had  never before appeared capable     mrs  ormond hoped  that after the alarm was over  the circumstance would  pass away from her pupil s mind  but on the contrary  it left the most  forcible impression  virginia became silent and melancholy  and whole  hours were spent in reverie  mrs  ormond imagined  that notwithstanding  virginia s entire ignorance of the world  she had acquired from books  sufficient knowledge to be alarmed at the idea of being taken for  clarence hervey s mistress  she touched upon this subject with much  delicacy  and the answers that she received confirmed her opinion   virginia had been inspired by romances with the most exalted notions of  female delicacy and honour  but from her perfect ignorance  these were  rather vague ideas than principles of conduct      we shall see mr  hervey to morrow  he has written me word that he will  come from town  and spend the day with us       i shall be ashamed to see him after what has passed   said virginia      you have no cause for shame  my dear  mr  hervey will try to discover  the persons who insulted you  and he will punish them  they will never  return here  you need not fear that  he is willing and able to protect  you       yes of that i am sure  but what did that strange man mean  when he  said        what  my dear       that  perhaps  mr  hervey would marry me      virginia pronounced these words with difficulty  mrs  ormond was silent   for she was much embarrassed  virginia having conquered her first  difficulty  seemed resolute to obtain an answer      you do not speak to me  will you not tell me  dear mrs  ormond   said  she  hanging upon her fondly   what did he mean       what he said  i suppose       but he said  that if i behaved well  i might get mr  hervey to marry  me  what did he mean by that   said virginia  in an accent of offended  pride      he spoke very rudely and improperly  but it is not worth while to think  of what he said  or what he meant       but  dear mrs  ormond  do not go away from me now  i never so much  wished to speak to you in my whole life  and you turn away from me       well  my love  well  what would you say       tell me one thing  only one thing  and you will set my heart at ease   does mr  hervey  wish  me to be his wife       i cannot tell you that  my dearest virginia  time will show us  perhaps  his heart has not yet decided       i wish it would decide   said virginia  sighing deeply   and i wish  that strange man had not told me any thing about the matter  it has made  me very unhappy      she covered her eyes with her hand  but the tears trickled between her  fingers  and rolled fast down her arm  mrs  ormond  quite overcome by  the sight of her distress  was no longer able to keep the secret with  which she had been entrusted by clarence hervey  and after all  thought  she  virginia will hear it from himself soon  i shall only spare her  some unnecessary pain  it is cruel to see her thus  and to keep her in  suspense  besides  her weakness might be her ruin  in his opinion  if it  were to extinguish all her energy  and deprive her of the very power of  pleasing  how wan she looks  and how heavy are those sleepless eyes   she is not  indeed  in a condition to meet him  when he comes to us  to morrow  if she had some hopes  she would revive and appear with her  natural ease and grace      my sweet child   said mrs  ormond   i cannot bear to see you so  melancholy  consider  mr  hervey will be with us to morrow  and it will  give him a great deal of pain to see you so       will it  then i will try to be very gay      mrs  ormond was so delighted to see virginia smile  that she could not  forbear adding   the strange man was not wrong in every thing he said   you  will   one of these days  be mr  hervey s wife       that  i am sure   said virginia  bursting again into tears   that  i am  sure  i do not wish  unless  he  does       he does  he does  my dear  do not let this delicacy of yours  which has  been wound up too high  make you miserable  he thought of you  he loved  you long and long ago       he is very good  too good   said virginia  sobbing      nay  what is more  for i can keep nothing from you  he has been  educating you all this time on purpose for his wife  and he only waits  till your education is finished  and till he is sure that you feel no  repugnance for him       i should be very ungrateful if i felt any repugnance for him   said  virginia   i feel none       oh  that you need not assure me   said mrs  ormond      but i do not wish to marry him  i do not wish to marry       you are a modest girl to say so  and this modesty will make you ten  times more amiable  especially in mr  hervey s eyes  heaven forbid that  i should lessen it      the next morning virginia  who always slept in the same room with mrs   ormond  wakened her  by crying out in her sleep  with a voice of terror    oh  save him   save mr  hervey   mr  hervey   forgive me  forgive me      mrs  ormond drew back the curtain  and saw virginia lying fast asleep   her beautiful face convulsed with agony      he s dead   mr  hervey   cried she  in a voice of exquisite distress   then starting up  and stretching out her arms  she uttered a piercing  cry  and awoke      my love  you have been dreaming frightfully   said mrs  ormond      is it all a dream   cried virginia  looking round fearfully      all a dream  my dear   said mrs  ormond  taking her hand      i am very  very glad of it   let me breathe  it was  indeed  a  frightful dream       your hand still trembles   said mrs  ormond   let me put back this hair  from your poor face  and you will grow cool  and forget this foolish  dream       no  i must tell it you  i ought to tell it you  but it was all so  confused  i can recollect only some parts of it  first  i remember that  i thought i was not myself  but the virginia that we were reading of the  other night  and i was somewhere in the isle of france  i thought the  place was something like the forest where my grandmother s cottage used  to be  only there were high mountains and rocks  and cocoa trees and  plantains       such as you saw in the prints of that book       yes  only beautiful  beautiful beyond description  and it was  moonlight  brighter and clearer than any moonlight i ever before had  seen  and the air was fresh yet perfumed  and i was seated under the  shade of a plane tree  beside virginia s fountain       just as you are in your picture       yes  but paul was seated beside me       paul   said mrs  ormond  smiling   that is mr  hervey       no  not mr  hervey s face  though it spoke with his voice  this is what  i thought that i must tell you  it was another figure  it seemed a  real living person  it knelt at my feet  and spoke to me so kindly  so  tenderly  and just as it was going to kiss my hand  mr  hervey appeared   and i started terribly  for i was afraid he would be displeased  and  that he would think me  ungrateful   and he was displeased  and he  called me ungrateful virginia  and frowned  and then i gave him my hand   and then every thing changed  i do not know how suddenly  and i was in a  place like the great print of the cathedral  which mr  hervey showed me   and there were crowds of people  i was almost stifled   you  pulled me  on  as i remember  and mr  moreton was there  standing upon some steps  by what you called the altar  and then we knelt down before him  and mr   hervey was putting a ring on my finger  but there came suddenly from the  crowd that strange man  who was here the other day  and he dragged me  along with him  i don t know how or where  swiftly down precipices   whilst i struggled  and at last fell  then all changed again  and i  was in a magnificent field  covered with cloth of gold  and there  were beautiful ladies seated under canopies  and i thought it was a  tournament  such as i have read of  only more splendid  and two knights   clad in complete armour  and mounted on fiery steeds  were engaged  in single combat  and they fought furiously  and i thought they were  fighting for me  one of the knights wore black plumes in his helmet  and  the other white  and  as he was passing by me  the vizor of the knight  of the white plumes was raised  and i saw it was        clarence hervey   said mrs  ormond      no  still the same figure that knelt to me  and i wished him to be  victorious  and he was victorious  and he unhorsed his adversary  and  stood over him with his drawn sword  and then i saw that the knight in  the black plumes was mr  hervey  and i ran to save him  but i could  not  i saw him weltering in his blood  and i heard him say   perfidious    ungrateful  virginia  you are the cause of my death    and i screamed   i believe  and that awakened me       well  it is only a dream  my love   said mrs  ormond   mr  hervey is  safe  get up and dress yourself  and you will soon see him       but was it not wrong and  ungrateful  to wish that the knight in the  white plumes should be victorious       your poor little head is full of nothing but these romances  and love  for mr  hervey  it is your love for him that makes you fear that he will  be jealous  but he is not so simple as you are  he will forgive you  for wishing that the knight in the white plumes should be victorious   especially as you did not know that the other knight was mr  hervey   come  my love  dress yourself  and think no more of these foolish  dreams  and all will go well            chapter xxvii    a discovery       instead of the open  childish  affectionate familiarity with which  virginia used to meet clarence hervey  she now received him with  reserved  timid embarrassment  struck by this change in her manner   and alarmed by the dejection of her spirits  which she vainly strove to  conceal  he eagerly inquired  from mrs  ormond  into the cause of this  alteration     mrs  ormond s answers  and her account of all that had passed during his  absence  increased his anxiety  his indignation was roused by the insult  which virginia had been offered by the strangers who had scaled the  garden wall  all his endeavours to discover who they were proved  ineffectual  but  lest they should venture to repeat their visit  he  removed her from windsor  and took her directly to twickenham  here  he stayed with her and mrs  ormond some days  to determine  by his own  observation  how far the representations that had been made to him were  just  till this period he had been persuaded that virginia s regard for  him was rather that of gratitude than of love  and with this opinion   he thought that he had no reason seriously to reproach himself for the  imprudence with which he had betrayed the partiality that he felt for  her in the beginning of their acquaintance  he flattered himself that  even should she have discerned his intentions  her heart would not  repine at any alteration in his sentiments  and if her happiness were  uninjured  his reason told him that he was not in honour bound to  constancy  the case was now altered  unwilling as he was to believe  he  could no longer doubt  virginia could neither meet his eyes nor speak to  him without a degree of embarrassment which she had not sufficient art  to conceal  she trembled whenever he came near her  and if he looked  grave  or forbore to take notice of her  she would burst into tears   at other times  contrary to the natural indolence of her character  she  would exert herself to please him with surprising energy  she learned  every thing that he wished  her capacity seemed suddenly to unfold  for  an instant  clarence flattered himself that both her fits of melancholy  and of exertion might arise from a secret desire to see something of  that world from which she had been secluded  one day he touched upon  this subject  to see what effect it would produce  but  contrary to his  expectations  she seemed to have no desire to quit her retirement  she  did not wish  she said  for amusements such as he described  she did not  wish to go into the world     it was during the time of his passion for her that clarence had her  picture painted in the character of st  pierre s virginia  it happened  to be in the room in which they were now conversing  and when she spoke  of loving a life of retirement  clarence accidentally cast his eyes upon  the picture  and then upon virginia  she turned away  sighed deeply  and  when  in a tone of kindness  he asked her if she were unhappy  she hid  her face in her hands  and made no answer     mr  hervey could not be insensible to her distress or to her delicacy   he saw her bloom fading daily  her spirits depressed  her existence a  burden to her  and he feared that his own imprudence had been the cause  of all this misery      i have taken her out of a situation in which she might have spent her  life usefully and happily  i have excited false hopes in her mind  and  now she is a wretched and useless being  i have won her affections  her  happiness depends totally upon me  and can i forsake her  mrs  ormond  says  that she is convinced virginia would not survive the day of my  marriage with another  i am not disposed to believe that girls often  die or destroy themselves for love  nor am i a coxcomb enough to suppose  that love for me must be extraordinarily desperate  but here s a girl   who is of a melancholy temperament  who has a great deal of natural  sensibility  whose affections have all been concentrated  who has lived  in solitude  whose imagination has dwelt  for a length of time  upon a  certain set of ideas  who has but one object of hope  in such a mind   and in such circumstances  passion may rise to a paroxysm of despair      pity  generosity  and honour  made him resolve not to abandon this  unfortunate girl  though he felt that every time he saw virginia  his  love for belinda increased  it was this struggle in his mind betwixt  love and honour which produced all the apparent inconsistency and  irresolution that puzzled lady delacour and perplexed belinda  the  lock of beautiful hair  which so unluckily fell at belinda s feet  was  virginia s  he was going to take it to the painter  who had made the  hair in her picture considerably too dark  how this picture got into the  exhibition must now be explained     whilst mr  hervey s mind was in that painful state of doubt which has  just been described  a circumstance happened that promised him some  relief from his embarrassment  mr  moreton  the clergyman who used to  read prayers every sunday for mrs  ormond and virginia  did not come one  sunday at the usual time  the next morning he called on mr  hervey  with  a face that showed he had something of importance to communicate      i have hopes  my dear clarence   said he   that i have found out your  virginia s father  yesterday  a musical friend of mine persuaded me  to go with him to hear the singing at the asylum for children in  st  george s fields  there is a girl there who has indeed a charming  voice  but that s not to the present purpose  after church was over   i happened to be one of the last that stayed  for i am too old to love  bustling through a crowd  perhaps  as you are impatient  you think  that s nothing to the purpose  and yet it is  as you shall hear   when the congregation had almost left the church  i observed that the  children of the asylum remained in their places  by order of one of  the governors  and a middle aged gentleman went round amongst the elder  girls  examined their countenances with care  and inquired with much  anxiety their ages  and every particular relative to their parents  the  stranger held a miniature picture in his hand  with which he compared  each face  i was not near enough to him   continued mr  moreton   to see  the miniature distinctly  but from the glimpse i caught of it  i thought  that it was like your virginia  though it seemed to be the portrait of a  child but four or five years old  i understand that this gentleman will  be at the asylum again next sunday  i heard him express a wish to see  some of the girls who happened last sunday to be absent       do you know this gentleman s name  or where he lives   said clarence      i know nothing of him   replied mr  moreton   except that he seems fond  of painting  for he told one of the directors  who was looking at his  miniature  that it was remarkably well painted  and that  in his happier  days  he had been something of a judge of the art      impatient to see the stranger  who  he did not doubt  was virginia s  father  clarence hervey went the next sunday to the asylum  but no such  gentleman appeared  and all that he could learn respecting him was  that  he had applied to one of the directors of the institution for leave to  see and question the girls  in hopes of finding amongst them his lost  daughter  that in the course of the week  he had seen all those who were  not at the church the last sunday  none of the directors knew any thing  more concerning him  but the porter remarked  that he came in a very  handsome coach  and one of the girls of the asylum said that he gave her  half a guinea  because she was a little like  his poor rachel  who was  dead   but that he had added  with a sigh   this cannot be my daughter   for she is only thirteen  and my girl  if she be now living  must be  nearly eighteen      the age  the name  every circumstance confirmed mr  hervey in the belief  that this stranger was the father of virginia  and he was disappointed  and provoked by having missed the opportunity of seeing or speaking to  him  it occurred to clarence that the gentleman might probably visit the  foundling hospital  and thither he immediately went  to make inquiries   he was told that a person  such as he described  had been there about  a month before  and had compared the face of the oldest girls with a  little picture of a child  that he gave money to several of the girls   but that they did not know his name  or any thing more about him     mr  hervey now inserted proper advertisements in all the papers  but  without producing any effect  at last  recollecting what mr  moreton  told him of the stranger s love of pictures  he determined to put his  portrait of virginia into the exhibition  in hopes that the gentleman  might go there and ask some questions about it  which might lead to a  discovery  the young artist  who had painted this picture  was under  particular obligations to clarence  and he promised that he would  faithfully comply with his request  to be at somerset house regularly  every morning  as soon as the exhibition opened  that he would stay  there till it closed  and watch whether any of the spectators were  particularly struck with the portrait of virginia  if any person should  ask questions respecting the picture  he was to let mr  hervey know  immediately  and to give the inquirer his address     now it happened that the very day when lady delacour and belinda were at  the exhibition  the painter called clarence aside  and informed him that  a gentleman had just inquired from him very eagerly  whether the picture  of virginia was a portrait  this gentleman proved to be not the stranger  who had been at the asylum  but an eminent jeweller  who told mr  hervey  that his curiosity about the picture arose merely from its striking  likeness to a miniature  which had been lately left at his house to  be new set  it belonged to a mr  hartley  a gentleman who had made a  considerable fortune in the west indies  but who was prevented from  enjoying his affluence by the loss of an only daughter  of whom the  miniature was a portrait  taken when she was not more than four or five  years old  when clarence heard all this  he was extremely impatient to  know where mr  hartley was to be found  but the jeweller could only  tell him that the miniature had been called for the preceding day by mr   hartley s servant  who said his master was leaving town in a great hurry  to go to portsmouth  to join the west india fleet  which was to sail  with the first favourable wind     clarence determined immediately to follow him to portsmouth  he had not  a moment to spare  for the wind was actually favourable  and his only  chance of seeing mr  hartley was by reaching portsmouth as soon as  possible  this was the cause of his taking leave of belinda in such  an abrupt manner  painful indeed were his feelings at that moment  and  great the difficulty he felt in parting with her  without giving any  explanation of his conduct  which must have appeared to her capricious  and mysterious  he was aware that he had explicitly avowed to lady  delacour his admiration of miss portman  and that in a thousand  instances he had betrayed his passion  yet of her love he dared not  trust himself to think  whilst his affairs were in this doubtful  state  he had  it is true  some faint hopes that a change in virginia s  situation might produce an alteration in her sentiments  and he resolved  to decide his own conduct by the manner in which she should behave   if her father should be found  and she should become heiress to a  considerable fortune  new views might then open to her imagination  the  world  the fashionable world  in all its glory  would be before her   her beauty and fortune would attract a variety of admirers  and clarence  thought that perhaps her partiality for him might become less exclusive   when she had more opportunities of choice  if her love arose merely from  circumstances  with circumstances it would change  if it were only a  disease of the imagination  induced by her seclusion from society   it might be cured by mixing with the world  and then he should be  at liberty to follow the dictates of his own heart  and declare his  attachment to belinda  but if he should find that change of situation  made no alteration in virginia s sentiments  if her happiness should  absolutely depend upon the realization of those hopes which he had  imprudently excited  he felt that he should be bound to her by all the  laws of justice and honour  laws which no passion could tempt him to  break  full of these ideas  he hurried to portsmouth in pursuit of  virginia s father  the first question he asked  upon his arrival there   may easily be guessed      has the west india fleet sailed       no  it sails to morrow morning   was the answer     he hastened instantly to make inquiries for mr  hartley  no such  person could be found  no such gentleman was to be heard of any where    hartley   he was sure  was the name which the jeweller mentioned to  him  but it was in vain that he repeated it  no mr  hartley was to be  heard of at portsmouth  except a pawnbroker  at last  a steward of one  of the west indiamen recollected that a gentleman of that name came over  with him in the effingham  and that he talked of returning in the same  vessel to the west indies  if he should ever leave england again      but we have heard nothing of him since  sir   said the steward   no  passage is taken for him with us       and my life to a china orange   cried a sailor who was standing by    he s gone to kingdom come  or more likely to bedlam  afore this  for  he was plaguy crazy in his timbers  and his head wanted righting  i take  it  if it was he  jack  who used to walk the deck  you know  with a bit  of a picture in his hand  to which he seemed to be mumbling his prayers  from morning to night  there s no use in sounding for him  master   he s down in davy s locker long ago  or stowed into the tight waistcoat  before this time o day      notwithstanding this knowing sailor s opinion  clarence would not desist  from his sounding  because having so lately heard of him at different  places  he could not believe that he was gone either into davy s locker  or to bedlam  he imagined that  by some accident  mr  hartley had been  detained upon the road to portsmouth  and in the expectation that he  would certainly arrive before the fleet should sail  clarence waited  with tolerable patience  he waited  however  in vain  he saw the  effingham and the whole fleet sail  no mr  hartley arrived  as he  hailed one of the boats of the effingham  which was rowing out with some  passengers  who had been too late to get on board  his friend the sailor  answered   we ve no crazy man here  i told you  master  he d never go  out no more in the effingham  he s where i said  master  you ll find  or  nowhere      mr  hervey remained some days at portsmouth  after the fleet had sailed   in hopes that he might yet obtain some information  but none could be  had  neither could any farther tidings be obtained from the jeweller   who had first mentioned mr  hartley  despairing of success in the object  of his journey  he  however  determined to delay his return to town for  some time  in hopes that absence might efface the impression which had  been made on the heart of virginia  he made a tour along the picturesque  coasts of dorset and devonshire  and it was during this excursion  that he wrote the letters to lady delacour which have so often been  mentioned  he endeavoured to dissipate his thoughts by new scenes and  employments  but all his ideas involuntarily centred in belinda  if he  saw new characters  he compared them with hers  or considered how far  she would approve or condemn them  the books that he read were perused  with a constant reference to what she would think or feel  and during  his whole journey he never beheld any beautiful prospect  without  wishing that it could at the same instant be seen by belinda  if her  name were mentioned but once in his letters  it was because he dared not  trust himself to speak of her  she was for ever present to his mind  but  while he was writing to lady delacour  her idea pressed more strongly  upon his heart  he recollected that it was she who first gave him a just  insight into her ladyship s real character  he recollected that she  had joined with him in the benevolent design of reconciling her to lord  delacour  and of creating in her mind a taste for domestic happiness   this remembrance operated powerfully to excite him to fresh exertions   and the eloquence which touched lady delacour so much in these    edifying   letters  as she called them  was in fact inspired by  belinda     whenever he thought distinctly upon his future plans  virginia s  attachment  and the hopes which he had imprudently inspired  appeared  insuperable obstacles to his union with miss portman  but  in more  sanguine moments  he flattered himself with a confused notion that these  difficulties would vanish  great were his surprise and alarm when he  received that letter of lady delacour s  in which she announced the  probability of belinda s marriage with mr  vincent  in consequence of  his moving from place to place in the course of his tour  he did not  receive this letter till nearly a fortnight after it should have come  to his hands  the instant he received it he set out on his way home  he  travelled with all that expedition which money can command in england   his first thought and first wish when he arrived in town were to go  to lady delacour s  but he checked his impatience  and proceeded  immediately to twickenham  to have his fate decided by virginia  it was  with the most painful sensations that he saw her again  the accounts  which he received from mrs  ormond convinced him that absence had  produced none of the effects which he expected on the mind of her pupil   mrs  ormond was naturally both of an affectionate disposition and a  timid temper  she had become excessively fond of virginia  and her  anxiety was more than in proportion to her love  it sometimes balanced  and even overbalanced her regard and respect for clarence hervey  himself  when he spoke of his attachment to belinda  and of his doubts  respecting virginia  she could no longer restrain her emotion      oh  indeed  mr  hervey   said she   this is no time for reasoning and  doubting  no man in his senses  no man who is not wilfully blind  could  doubt her being distractedly fond of you       i am sorry for it   said clarence      and why  oh  why  mr  hervey  don t you recollect the time when you  were all impatience to call her yours   when you thought her the most  charming creature in the whole world       i had not seen belinda portman then       and i wish to heaven you never had seen her  but oh  surely  mr   hervey  you will not desert my virginia   must her health  her  happiness  her reputation  all be the sacrifice       reputation  mrs  ormond       reputation  mr  hervey  you do not know in what a light she is  considered here  nor did i till lately  but i tell you her reputation  is injured  fatally injured  it is whispered  and more than whispered  everywhere  that she is your mistress  a woman came here the other  day with the bullfinch  and she looked at me  and spoke in such an  extraordinary way  that i was shocked more than i can express  i  need not tell you all the particulars  it is enough that i have made  inquiries  and am sure  too sure  of what i say  that nothing but your  marriage with virginia can save her reputation  or       mrs  ormond stopped short  for at this instant virginia entered the  room  walking in her slow manner  as if she were in a deep reverie      since my return   said clarence  in an embarrassed voice   i have  scarcely heard a syllable from miss st  pierre s lips        miss st  pierre    he used to call me virginia   said she  turning to  mrs  ormond   he is angry with me  he used to call me virginia       but you were a child then  you know  my love   said mrs  ormond      and i wish i was still a child   said virginia  then  after a long  pause  she approached mr  hervey with extreme timidity  and  opening  a portfolio which lay on the table  she said to him   if you are at  leisure  if i do not interrupt you  would you look at these drawings   though they are not worth your seeing  except as proofs that i can  conquer my natural indolence      the drawings were views which she had painted from memory  of scenes in  the new forest  near her grandmother s cottage  that cottage was drawn  with an exactness that proved how fresh it was in her remembrance  many  recollections rushed forcibly into clarence hervey s mind at the sight  of this cottage  the charming image of virginia  as it first struck his  fancy   the smile  the innocent smile  with which she offered him the  finest rose in her basket   the stern voice in which her grandmother  spoke to her   the prophetic fears of her protectress   the figure of  the dying woman   the solemn promise he made to her   all recurred  in  rapid succession  to his memory      you don t seem to like that   said virginia  and then putting another  drawing into his hands   perhaps this may please you better       they are beautiful  they are surprisingly well done   exclaimed he      i knew he would like them  i told you so   cried mrs  ormond  in a  triumphant tone      you see   said virginia   that though you have heard scarcely a  syllable from miss st  pierre s lips since your return  yet she has not  been unmindful of your wishes in your absence  you told her  some time  ago  that you wished she would try to improve in drawing  she has done  her best  but do not trouble yourself to look at them any longer   said  virginia  taking one of her drawings from his hand   i merely wanted to  show you that  though i have no genius  i have some       her voice faltered so that she could not pronounce the word  gratitude      mrs  ormond pronounced it for her  and added   i can answer for it  that  virginia is not ungrateful       ungrateful   repeated clarence   who ever thought her so  why did you  put these ideas into her mind      virginia  resting her head on mrs  ormond s shoulder  wept bitterly      you have worked upon her sensibility till you have made her miserable    cried clarence  angrily   virginia  listen to me  look at me   said he   affectionately taking her hand  but she pressed closer to mrs  ormond   and would not raise her head   do not consider me as your master  your  tyrant  do not imagine that i think you ungrateful       oh  i am  i am  i am ungrateful to you   cried she  sobbing   but mrs   ormond never told me so  do not blame her  she has never worked upon  my sensibility  do you think   said she  looking up  while a transient  expression of indignation passed over her countenance   do you think i  cannot  feel  without having been taught      clarence uttered a deep sigh      but if you feel too much  my dearest virginia   if you give way to your  feelings in this manner   said mrs  ormond   you will make both yourself  and mr  hervey unhappy       heaven forbid  the first wish of my soul is    she paused   i should be  the most ungrateful wretch in the world  if i were to make him unhappy       but if he sees you miserable  virginia       then he shall not see it   said she  wiping the tears from her face      to imagine that you were unhappy  and that you concealed it from us   would be still worse   said clarence      but why should you imagine it   replied virginia   you are too good   too kind  but do not fancy that i am not happy  i am sure i ought to be  happy       do you regret your cottage   said clarence   these drawings show how  well you remember it      virginia coloured  and  with some hesitation  answered   is it my fault  if i cannot forget       you were happier then  virginia  than you are now  you will confess    said mrs  ormond  who was not a woman of refined delicacy  and who  thought that the best chance she had of working upon mr  hervey s sense  of honour was by making it plain to him how much her pupil s affections  were engaged     virginia made no answer to this question  and her silence touched  clarence more than any thing she could have said  when mrs  ormond  repeated her question  he relieved the trembling girl by saying   my  dear mrs  ormond  confidence must be won  not demanded       i have no right to insist upon confessions  i know   said mrs  ormond    but        confessions  i do not wish to conceal any thing  but i think sincerity  is not  always  in our sex consistent with  i mean  i don t know what i  mean  what i say  or what i ought to say   cried virginia  and she sunk  down on a sofa  in extreme confusion      why will you agitate her  mrs  ormond  in this manner   said mr   hervey  with an expression of sudden anger  it was succeeded by a look  of such tender compassion for virginia  that mrs  ormond rejoiced to  have excited his anger  at any price she wished to serve her beloved  pupil      do not be in the least apprehensive  my dear virginia  that we should  take ungenerous advantage of the openness and simplicity of your  character   said mr  hervey      oh  no  no  i cannot  do not apprehend any thing ungenerous from you   you are  you ever have been  my best  my most generous friend  but i  fear that i have not the simplicity of character  the openness that you  imagine  and yet  i am sure  i wish  from the bottom of my heart  i wish  to do right  if i knew how  but there is not one  no  not one  person in  the whole world   continued she  her eyes moving from mrs  ormond to mr   hervey  and from him to mrs  ormond again   not one person in the whole  world i dare  i ought  to lay my heart open to  i have  perhaps  said  more than is proper already  but this i know   added she  in a firm  tone  rising  and addressing herself to clarence    you  shall never be  made unhappy by me  and do not think about my happiness so much   said  she  forcing a smile   i am  i will be  perfectly happy  only let me  always know your wishes  your sentiments  your feelings  and by them i  will  as i ought  regulate mine       amiable  charming  generous girl   cried clarence      take care   said mrs  ormond   take care  virginia  lest you promise  more than you can perform  wishes  and feelings  and sentiments  are not  to be so easily regulated       i did not  i believe  say it was easy  but i hope it is possible    replied virginia   i promise nothing but what i am able to perform       i doubt it   said mrs  ormond  shaking her head   you  are   you  will   be perfectly happy  oh  virginia  my love  do not deceive yourself  do  not deceive us so terribly  i am sorry to put you to the blush  but        not a word more  my dear madam  i beg  i insist   said mr  hervey in a  commanding tone  but  for the first time in her life  regardless of him   she persisted      i only ask you to call to mind  my dearest virginia   said she  taking  her hand   the morning that you screamed in your sleep  the morning when  you told me the frightful dream  were you perfectly happy then       it is easy to force my thoughts from me   said virginia  withdrawing  her hand from mrs  ormond   but it is cruel to do so   and with an air  of offended dignity she passed them  and quitted the room      i wish to heaven   exclaimed mrs  ormond   that miss portman was  married  and out of the way  i shall never forgive myself  we have used  this poor girl cruelly amongst us  she loves you to distraction  and i  have encouraged her passion  and i have betrayed her  oh  fool that i  was  i told her that she would certainly be your wife       you have told her so   did i not charge you  mrs  ormond          yes  but i could not help it  when i saw the sweet girl fading  away  and  besides  i am sure she thought it  from your manner  long  and long before i told it to her  do you forget how fond of her you were  scarce one short year ago  and do you forget how plainly you let her see  your passion  oh  how can you blame her  if she loves you  and if she is  unhappy       i blame no one but myself   cried clarence   i must abide by the  consequences of my own folly  unhappy   she shall not be unhappy  she  does not deserve to be so      he walked backward and forward  with hasty steps  for some minutes  then  sat down and wrote a letter to virginia     when he had finished it  he put it into mrs  ormond s hands      read it  seal it  give it to her  and let her answer be sent to town to  me  at dr  x  s  in clifford street      mrs  ormond clasped her hands  in an ecstasy of joy  as she glanced her  eye over the letter  for it contained an offer of his hand      this is like yourself  like what i always knew you to be  dear mr   hervey   she exclaimed     but her exclamation was lost upon him  when she looked up  to repeat her  praises  she perceived he was gone  after the effort which he had made   he wished for time to tranquillize his mind  before he should again see  virginia  what her answer to this letter would be he could not doubt   his fate was now decided  and he determined immediately to write to lady  delacour to explain his situation  he felt that he had not sufficient  fortitude at this moment to make such an explanation in person  with  all the strength of his mind  he endeavoured to exclude belinda from his  thoughts  but  curiosity    for he would suffer himself to call it by no  other name   curiosity to know whether she were actually engaged to mr   vincent obtruded itself with such force  that it could not be resisted     from dr  x     he thought he could obtain full information  and he  hastened immediately to town  when he got to clifford street  he found  that the doctor was not at home  his servant said  he might probably be  met with at mrs  margaret delacour s  as he usually finished his morning  rounds at her house  thither mr  hervey immediately went     the first sound that he heard  as he went up her stairs  was the  screaming of a macaw  and the first person he saw  through the open door  of the drawing room  was helena delacour  she was standing with her back  to him  leaning over the macaw s cage  and he heard her say in a joyful  tone   yes  though you do scream so frightfully  my pretty macaw  i love  you as well as marriott ever did  when my dear  good miss portman  sent  this macaw  my dear aunt  here s mr  hervey   you were just wishing to  see him       mr  hervey   said the old lady  with a benevolent smile   your little  friend helena tells you truth  we were just wishing for you  i am sure  it will give you pleasure to hear that i am at last a convert to your  opinion of lady delacour  she has given up all those that i used to call  her rantipole acquaintance  she has reconciled herself to her husband   and to his friends  and helena is to go home to live with her  here is  a charming note i have just received from her  dine with me on thursday  next  and you will meet her ladyship  and see a happy family party   you have had some share in the  reformation   i know  and that was the  reason i wished that you should be with us on thursday  you see i am not  an obstinate old woman  though i was cross the first day i saw you at  lady anne percival s  i found i was mistaken in your character  and i  am glad of it  but this note of lady delacour s seems to have struck you  dumb      there were  indeed  a few words in this note  which deprived him  for  some moments  of all power of utterance      the report you have heard  unlike most other reports  is perfectly well  founded  mr  vincent  belinda s admirer  is here  i will bring him with  us on thursday      mr  hervey was relieved from the necessity of accounting to mrs   delacour for his sudden embarrassment  by the entrance of dr  x     and  another gentleman  of whom  in the confusion of his mind  clarence  did not at first take any notice  dr  x      with his usual mixture  of benevolence and raillery  addressed himself to clarence  whilst the  stranger took out of his pocket some papers  and in a low voice entered  earnestly into conversation with mrs  delacour      now  tell me  if you can  clarence   said dr  x       which of your  three mistresses you like best  i think i left you some months ago in  great doubt upon this subject  are you still in that philosophic state       no   said clarence   all doubts are over  i am going to be married       bravo   but you look as if you were going to be hanged  may i  as it  will so soon be in the newspaper  may i ask the name of the fair lady       virginia st  pierre  you shall know her history and mine when we are  alone   said mr  hervey  lowering his voice      you need not lower your voice   said dr  x       for mrs  delacour  is  as you see  so much taken up with her own affairs  that she has no  curiosity for those of her neighbours  and mr  hartley is as busy as        mr  who  mr  hartley did you say   interrupted clarence  eagerly  turning his eyes upon the stranger  who was a middle aged gentleman   exactly answering the description of the person who had been at the  asylum in search of his daughter      mr  hartley  yes  what astonishes you so much   said x      calmly   he  is a west indian  i met him in cambridgeshire last summer  at his friend  mr  horton s  he has been very generous to the poor people who suffered  by the fire  and he is now consulting with mrs  delacour  who has an  estate adjoining to mr  horton s  about her tenants  whose houses in  the village were burnt  now i have  in as few words and parentheses  as possible  told you all i know of mr  hartley s history  but your  curiosity still looks voracious       i want to know whether he has a miniature   said clarence  hastily    introduce me to him  for heaven s sake  directly       mr  hartley   cried the doctor  raising his voice   give me leave to  introduce my friend mr  hervey to you  and to your miniature picture  if  you have one      mr  hartley sighed profoundly as he drew from his bosom a small  portrait  which he put into mr  hervey s hands  saying   alas  sir  you  cannot  i fear  give me any tidings of the original  it is the picture  of a daughter  whom i have never seen since she was an infant  whom i  never shall see again      clarence instantly knew it to be virginia  but as he was upon the point  of making some joyful exclamation  he felt dr  x     touch his shoulder   and looking up at mr  hartley  he saw in his countenance such strong  workings of passion  that he prudently suppressed his own emotion  and  calmly said   it would be cruel  sir  to give you false hopes       it would kill me  it would kill me  sir   or worse   worse  a thousand  times worse   cried mr  hartley  putting his hand to his forehead    what   continued he impatiently   what was the meaning of the look you  gave  when you first saw that picture  speak  if you have any humanity   did you ever see any one that resembles that picture       i have seen  i think  a picture   said clarence hervey   that has some  resemblance to it       when  where         my good sir   said dr  x       let me recommend it to you to consider  that there is scarcely any possibility of judging  from the features of  children  of what their faces may be when they grow up  nothing can be  more fallacious than these accidental resemblances between the pictures  of children and of grown up people      mr  hartley s countenance fell      but   added clarence hervey   you will perhaps  sir  think it worth  your while to see the picture of which i speak  you can see it at mr   f     s  the painter  in newman street  and i will accompany you thither  whenever you please       this moment  if you would have the goodness  my carriage is at the  door  and mrs  delacour will be so kind to excuse           oh  make no apologies to me at such a time as this   said mrs   delacour   away with you  gentlemen  as soon as you please  upon  condition  that if you have any good news to tell  some of you will  remember  in the midst of your joy  that such an old woman as mrs   margaret delacour exists  who loves to hear  good  news of those who  deserve it       it was so late in the day when they got to newman street  that they  were obliged to light candles  trembling with eagerness  mr  hartley  drew near  while clarence held the light to the picture      it is so like   said he  looking at his miniature   that i dare not  believe my senses  dr  x      pray do you look  my head is so dizzy  and  my eyes so    what do you think  sir  what do you say  doctor       that the likeness is certainly striking  but this seems to be a fancy  piece       a fancy piece   repeated mr  hartley  with terror   why then did you  bring me here   a fancy piece       no  sir  it is a portrait   said clarence   and if you will be calm  i  will tell you more       i will be calm  only is she alive       the lady  of whom this is the portrait  is alive   replied clarence  hervey  who was obliged to exert his utmost command over himself  to  maintain that composure which he saw was necessary   the lady  of whom  this is the portrait  is alive  and you shall see her to morrow       oh  why not now  cannot i see her now  i must see her to night  this  instant  sir       it is impossible   said mr  hervey   that you should see her this  instant  for she is some miles off  at twickenham       it is too late to go thither now  you cannot think of it  mr  hartley    continued dr  x      in a tone of command  to which he yielded more  readily than to reason     clarence had the presence of mind to recollect that it would be  necessary to prepare poor virginia for this meeting  and he sent a  messenger immediately to request that mrs  ormond would communicate the  intelligence with all the caution in her power     the next morning  mr  hartley and mr  hervey set off together for  twickenham  in their way thither clarence gradually confirmed mr   hartley in the belief that virginia was his daughter  by relating all  the circumstances that he had learned from her grandmother  and  from mrs  smith  the farmer s wife  with whom she had formerly been  acquainted  the name  the age  every particular  as it was disclosed   heightened his security and his joy     for some time mr  hartley s mind was so intent that he could not listen  to any thing  but at last clarence engaged his attention and suspended  his anxiety  by giving him a history of his own connexion with virginia   from the day of his first discovering her in the new forest  to the  letter which he had just written  to offer her his hand  the partiality  which it was suspected virginia felt for him was the only circumstance  which he suppressed  because  notwithstanding all mrs  ormond had  said  and all he had himself heard and seen  his obstinate incredulity  required confirmation under her own hand  or positively from her own  lips  he still fancied it was possible that change of situation might  alter her views and sentiments  and he earnestly entreated that she  might be left entirely to her own decision  it was necessary to make  this stipulation with her father  for in the excess of his gratitude  for the kindness which clarence had shown to her  he protested that he  should look upon her as a monster if she did not love him  he added   that if mr  hervey had not a farthing  he should prefer him to every man  upon earth  he  however  promised that he would conceal his wishes  and  that his daughter should act entirely from the dictates of her own mind   in the fulness of his heart  he told clarence all those circumstances  of his conduct towards virginia s mother which had filled his soul  with remorse  she was scarcely sixteen when he ran away with her from  a boarding school  he was at that time a gay officer  she a sentimental  girl  who had been spoiled by early novel reading  her father had a  small place at court  lived beyond his fortune  educated his daughter   to whom he could give no portion  as if she were to be heiress to a  large estate  then died  and left his widow absolutely in penury  this  widow was the old lady who lived in the cottage in the new forest  it  was just at the time of her husband s death  and of her own distress   that she heard of the elopement of her daughter from school  mr   hartley s parents were so much incensed by the match  that he was  prevailed upon to separate from his wife  and to go abroad  to push  his fortune in the army  his marriage had been secret  his own friends  disavowed it  notwithstanding the repeated  urgent entreaties of his  wife and of her mother  who was her only surviving relation  his wife   on her death bed  wrote to urge him to take charge of his daughter  and   to make the appeal stronger to his feelings  she sent him a picture  of his little girl  who was then about four years old  mr  hartley   however  was intent upon forming a new connexion with the rich widow  of a planter in jamaica  he married the widow  took possession of her  fortune  and all his affections soon were fixed upon a son  for whom  he formed  even from the moment of his birth  various schemes of  aggrandizement  the boy lived till he was about ten years old  when he  caught a fever  which at that time raged in jamaica  and  after a few  days  illness  died  his mother was carried off by the same disease   and mr  hartley  left alone in the midst of his wealth  felt how  insufficient it was to happiness  remorse now seized him  he returned to  england in search of his deserted daughter  to this neglected child he  now looked forward for the peace and happiness of the remainder of his  life  disappointment in all his inquiries for some months preyed  upon his spirits to such a degree  that his intellects were at times  disordered  this derangement was the cause of his not sooner recovering  his child  he was in confinement during the time that clarence hervey s  advertisements were inserted in the papers  and his illness was also the  cause of his not going to portsmouth  and sailing in the effingham  as  he had originally intended  the history of his connexion with mr  horton  would be uninteresting to the reader  it is enough to say  that he was  prevailed upon  by that gentleman  to spend some time in the country  with him  for the recovery of his health  and it was there that he  became acquainted with dr  x      who introduced him  as we have seen   to mrs  margaret delacour  at whose house he met clarence hervey  this  is the most succinct account that we can give of him and his affairs   his own account was ten times as long  but we spare our readers his  incoherences and reflections  because  perhaps  they are in a hurry to  get to twickenham  and to hear of his meeting with virginia     mrs  ormond found it no easy task to prepare virginia for the sight of  mr  hartley  virginia had scarcely ever spoken of her father  but the  remembrance of things which she had heard of him from her grandmother  was fresh in her mind  she had often pictured him in her fancy  and  she had secretly nourished the hope that she should not for ever be a   deserted child   mrs  ormond had observed  that in those romances  of  which she was so fond  every thing that related to children who were  deserted by their parents affected her strongly     the belief in what the french call  la force du sang  was suited to  her affectionate temper and ardent imagination  and it had taken full  possession of her mind  the eloquence of romance persuaded her that  she should not only discover but love her father with intuitive filial  piety  and she longed to experience those yearnings of affection of  which she had read so much     the first moment that mrs  ormond began to speak of mr  clarence  hervey s hopes of discovering her father  she was transported with joy      my  father    how delightful that word  father  sounds    my   father   may i say  my  father   and will he own me  and will he love  me  and will he give me his blessing  and will he fold me in his arms   and call me his daughter  his dear daughter   oh  how i shall love him   i will make it the whole business of my life to please him       the  whole  business   said mrs  ormond  smiling      not the whole   said virginia   i hope my father will like mr  hervey   did not you say that he is rich  i wish that my father may be  very   rich       that is the last wish that i should have expected to hear from you  my  virginia       but do you not know why i wish it   that i may show my gratitude to mr   hervey       my dear child   said mrs  ormond   these are most generous sentiments   and worthy of you  but do not let your imagination run away with you at  this rate  mr  hervey is rich enough       i wish he were poor   said virginia   that i might make him rich       he would not love you the better  my dear   said mrs  ormond   if  you had the wealth of the indies  perhaps your father may not be rich   therefore do not set your heart upon this idea      virginia sighed  fear succeeded to hope  and her imagination immediately  reversed the bright picture that it had drawn      but i am afraid   said she   that this gentleman is not my father  how  disappointed i shall be  i wish you had never told me all this  my dear  mrs  ormond       i would not have told it to you  if mr  hervey had not desired that i  should  and you maybe sure he would not have desired it  unless he had  good reason to believe that you would not be disappointed       but he is not sure  he does not say he is quite sure  and  even if i  were quite certain of his being my father  how can i be certain that he  will not disown me  he  who has deserted me so long  my grandmother  i  remember  often used to say that he had no natural affection       your grandmother was mistaken  then  for he has been searching for  his child all over england  mr  hervey says  and he has almost lost his  senses with grief and with remorse       remorse       yes  remorse  for having so long deserted you  he fears that you will  hate him       hate him   is it possible to hate a father   said virginia      he dreads that you should never forgive him       forgive him   i have read of parents forgiving their children  but  i never remember to have read of a daughter forgiving her father    forgive   you should not have used that word  i cannot  forgive  my  father  but i can love him  and i will make him quite forget all his  sorrows  i mean  all his sorrows about me      after this conversation virginia spent her time in imagining what sort  of person her father would be  whether he was like mr  hervey  what  words he would say  where he would sit  whether he would sit beside her   and  above all  whether he would give her his blessing      i am afraid   said she   of liking my father better than  any body  else        no danger of that  my dear   said mrs  ormond  smiling      i am glad of it  for it would be very wrong and  ungrateful  to like  any thing in this world so well as mr  hervey      the carriage now came to the door  mrs  ormond instantly ran to the  window  but virginia had not power to move  her heart beat violently      is he come   said she      yes  he is getting out of the carriage this moment      virginia stood with her eyes eagerly fixed upon the door   hark   said  she  laying her hand upon mrs  ormond s arm  to prevent her from moving    hush  that we may hear his voice      she was breathless  no voice was to be heard   they are not coming    said she  turning as pale as death  an instant afterwards her colour  returned  she heard the steps of two people coming up the stairs      his step   do you hear it   is it my father      virginia s imagination was worked to the highest pitch  she could  scarcely sustain herself  mrs  ormond supported her  at this instant her  father appeared      my child   the image of her mother   exclaimed he  stopping short  he  sunk upon a chair      my father   cried virginia  springing forward  and throwing herself at  his feet      the voice of her mother   said mr  hartley   my daughter   my long lost  child      he tried to raise her  but could not  her arms were clasped round his  knee  her face rested upon it  and when he stooped to kiss her cheek  he  found it cold  she had fainted     when she came to her senses  and found herself in her father s arms  she  could scarcely believe that it was not a dream      your blessing   give me your blessing  and then i shall know that you  are indeed my father   cried virginia  kneeling to him  and looking up  with an enthusiastic expression of filial piety in her countenance      god bless you  my sweet child   said he  laying his hand upon her   and  god forgive your father       my grandmother died without giving me her blessing   said virginia    but now i have been blessed by my father  happy  happy moment   o that  she could look down from heaven  and see us at this instant      virginia was so much astonished and overpowered by this sudden discovery  of a parent  and by the novelty of his first caresses  that after the  first violent effervescence of her sensibility was over  she might   to an indifferent spectator  have appeared stupid and insensible  mrs   ormond  though far from an indifferent spectator  was by no means a  penetrating judge of the human heart  she seldom saw more than the  external symptoms of feeling  and she was apt to be rather impatient  with her friends if theirs did not accord with her own      virginia  my dear   said she  in rather a reproachful tone   mr   hervey  you see  has left the room  on purpose to leave you at full  liberty to talk to your father  and i am going  but you are so silent       i have so much to say  and my heart is so full   said virginia      yes  i know you told me of a thousand things that you had to say to  your father  before you saw him       but now i see him  i have forgotten them all  i can think of nothing  but of him       of him and mr  hervey   said mrs  ormond      i was not thinking of mr  hervey at that moment   said virginia   blushing      well  my love  i will leave you to think and talk of what you please    said mrs  ormond  smiling significantly as she left the room     mr  hartley folded his daughter in his arms with the fondest expressions  of parental affection  and he was upon the point of telling her how much  he approved of the choice of her heart  but he recollected his promise   and he determined to sound her inclinations farther  before he even  mentioned the name of clarence hervey     he began by painting the pleasures of the world  that world from which  she had hitherto been secluded     she heard him with simple indifference  not even her curiosity was  excited     he observed  that though she had no curiosity to see  it was natural  that she must have some pleasure in the thoughts of being seen      what pleasure   said virginia      the pleasure of being admired and loved  beauty and grace such as  yours  my child  cannot be seen without commanding admiration and love       i do not want to be admired   replied virginia   and i want to be loved  by those only whom i love       my dearest daughter  you shall be entirely your own mistress  i will  never interfere  either directly or indirectly  in the disposal of your  heart      at these last words  virginia  who had listened to all the rest unmoved   took her father s hand  and kissed it repeatedly      now that i have found you  my darling child  let me at least make you  happy  if i can  it is the only atonement in my power  it will be the  only solace of my declining years  all that wealth can bestow        wealth   interrupted virginia   then you have wealth       yes  my child  may it make you happy  that is all the enjoyment i  expect from it  it shall all be yours       and may i do what i please with it   oh  then it will indeed make me  happy  i will give it all  all to mr  hervey  how delightful to have  something to  give  to mr  hervey       and had you never any thing to give to mr  hervey till now       never  never  he has given me every thing  now  oh  joyful day   i can  prove to him that virginia is not ungrateful       dear  generous girl   said her father  wiping the tears from his eyes    what a daughter have i found  but tell me  my child   continued he   smiling   do you think mr  hervey will be content if you give him only  your fortune  do you think that he would accept the fortune without the  heart  nay  do not turn away that dear blushing face from me  remember  it is  your father  who speaks to you  mr  hervey will not take your  fortune without yourself  i am afraid  what shall we do  must i refuse  him your hand       refuse him  do you think that i could refuse him any thing  who  has given me every thing   i should be a monster indeed  there is no  sacrifice i would not make  no exertion of which i am not capable  for  mr  hervey s sake  but  my dear father   said she  changing her tone    he never asked for my hand till yesterday      but he had won your heart long ago  i see  thought her father      i have written an answer to his letter  will you look at it  and tell  me if you approve of it       i do approve of it  my darling child  i will not read it  i know what  it must be  he has a right to the preference he has so nobly earned       oh  he has  he has  indeed   cried virginia  with an expression  of strong feeling   and now is the time to show him that i am not  ungrateful       how i love you for this  my child   cried her father  fondly embracing  her   this is exactly what i wished  though i did not dare to say so  till i was sure of your sentiments  mr  hervey charged me to leave you  entirely to yourself  he thought that your new situation might perhaps  produce some change in your sentiments  i see he was mistaken  and i am  heartily glad of it  but you are going to say something  my dear  do not  let me interrupt you       i was only going to beg that you would give this letter  my dear  father  to mr  hervey  it is an answer to one which he wrote to me  when i was poor    and deserted   she was near saying  but she stopped  herself      i wish   continued she   mr  hervey should know that my sentiments are  precisely the same now that they have always been  tell him   added she   proudly   that he did me injustice by imagining that my sentiments could  alter with my situation  he little knows virginia   clarence at this  moment entered the room  and mr  hartley eagerly led his daughter to  meet him      take her hand   cried he   you have her heart  you deserve it  and  she has just been very angry with me for doubting  but read her  letter   that will speak better for her  and more to your satisfaction   no doubt  than i can      virginia hastily put the letter into mr  hervey s hand  and  breaking  from her father  retired to her own apartment     with all the trepidation of a person who feels that the happiness of his  life is to be decided in a few moments  clarence tore open virginia s  letter  and  conscious that he was not able to command his emotion  he  withdrew from her father s inquiring eyes  mr  hartley  however  saw  nothing in this agitation but what he thought natural to a lover  and  he was delighted to perceive that his daughter had inspired so strong a  passion     virginia s letter contained but these few lines      most happy shall i be if the whole of my future life can prove to you  how deeply i feel your goodness      virginia st  pierre        end of c  hervey s packet       an acceptance so direct left clarence no alternative  his fate was  decided  he determined immediately to force himself to see belinda and  mr  vincent  for he fancied that his mind would be more at ease when he  had convinced himself by ocular demonstration that she was absolutely  engaged to another  that  consequently  even if he were free  he could  have no chance of gaining her affections  there are moments when we  desire the conviction which at another time would overwhelm us with  despair  it was in this temper that mr  hervey paid his visit to lady  delacour  but we have seen that he was unable to support for many  minutes that philosophic composure to which  at his first entrance  into the room  he had worked up his mind  the tranquillity which he had  expected would be the consequence of this visit  he was farther than  ever from obtaining  the extravagant joy with which lady delacour  received him  and an indescribable something in her manner when she  looked from him to belinda  and from belinda to mr  vincent  persuaded  him her ladyship wished that he were in mr  vincent s place  the idea  was so delightful  that his soul was entranced  and for a few minutes  virginia  and every thing that related to her  vanished from his  remembrance  it was whilst he was in this state that lady delacour  as  the reader may recollect  invited him into her lord s dressing room   to tell her the contents of the packet  which had not then reached her  hands  the request suddenly recalled him to his senses  but he felt  that he was not at this moment able to trust himself to her ladyship s  penetration  he therefore referred her to his letter for that  explanation which he dreaded to make in person  and he escaped from  belinda s presence  resolving never more to expose himself to such  danger     what effect his packet produced on lady delacour s mind and on  belinda s  we shall not at present stop to inquire  but having brought  up clarence hervey s affairs to the present day  we shall continue his  history           chapter xxviii     e o       though clarence hervey was not much disposed to see either virginia or  her father whilst he was in the state of perturbation into which he had  been thrown by his interview with belinda  yet he did not delay to send  his servant home with a note to mrs  ormond  to say that he would meet  mr  hartley  whenever he pleased  at his lawyer s  to make whatever  arrangements might be necessary for proper settlements     as he saw no possibility of receding with honour  he  with becoming  resolution  desired to urge things forward as fast as possible  and to  strengthen in his mind the sense of the  necessity  of the sacrifice  that he was bound to make  his passions were naturally impetuous  but  he had by persevering efforts brought them under the subjection of his  reason  his power over himself was now to be put to a severe trial     as he was going to town  he met lord delacour  who was riding in the  park  he was extremely intent upon his own thoughts  and was anxious to  pass unnoticed  in former times this would have been the most feasible  thing imaginable  for lord delacour used to detest the sight of clarence  hervey  whom he considered as the successor of colonel lawless in  his lady s favour  but his opinion and his feelings had been entirely  changed by the perusal of those letters  which were perfumed with ottar  of roses  even this perfume had  from that association  become agreeable  to him  he now accosted clarence with a warmth and cordiality in  his manner that at any other moment must have pleased as much as  it surprised him  but clarence was not in a humour to enter into  conversation      you seem to be in haste  mr  hervey   said his lordship  observing his  impatience   but  as i know your good nature  i shall make no scruple to  detain you a quarter of an hour      as he spoke he turned his horse  and rode with clarence  who looked as  if he wished that his lordship had been more scrupulous  and that he had  not such a reputation for good nature      you will not refuse me this quarter of an hour  i am sure   continued  lord delacour   when you hear that  by favouring me with your attention   you may perhaps materially serve an old  or rather a young  friend of  yours  and one whom i once fancied was a particular favourite  i mean   miss belinda portman      at the name of belinda portman  clarence hervey became all attention  he  assured his lordship that he was in no haste  and all his difficulty now  was to moderate the eagerness of his curiosity      we can take a turn or two in the park  as well as any where   said his  lordship   nobody will overhear us  and the sooner you know what i have  to say the better       certainly   said clarence     the most malevolent person upon earth could not have tired poor  clarence s patience more than good natured lord delacour contrived to  do  with the best intentions possible  by his habitual circumlocution     he descanted at length upon the difficulties  as the world goes  of  meeting with a confidential friend  whom it is prudent to trust in any  affair that demands delicacy  honour  and address  men of talents were  often  he observed  devoid of integrity  and men of integrity devoid of  talents  when he had obtained hervey s assent to this proposition  he  next paid him sundry handsome  but long winded compliments  then he  complimented himself for having just thought of mr  hervey as the  fittest person he could apply to  then he congratulated himself upon his  good luck in meeting with the very man he was just thinking of  at last   after clarence had returned thanks for all his kindness  and had given  assent to all his lordship s truisms  the substance of the business came  out     lord delacour informed mr  hervey   that he had been lately  commissioned  by lady delacour  to discover what attractions drew a mr   vincent so constantly to mrs  luttridge s         here he was going to explain who mr  vincent was  but clarence  assured him that he knew perfectly well that he had been a ward of mr   percival s  that he was a west indian of large fortune   c      and a lover of miss portman s  that is the most material part of the  story to  me    continued lord delacour   for otherwise  you know  mr   vincent would be no more to me than any other gentleman  but in that  point of view  i mean as a lover of belinda portman  and i may say  not  quite unlikely to be her husband  he is highly interesting to my  lady delacour  and to me  and to you  as miss portman s well wisher   doubtless       doubtless   was all mr  hervey could reply      now  you must know   continued his lordship   that lady delacour  has  for a woman  an uncommon share of penetration  and can put things  together in a wonderful way  in short  it has come to her  my lady  delacour s  knowledge  that before miss portman was at oakly park last  summer  and after she left it this autumn  mr  vincent was a constant  visitor at mrs  luttridge s  whilst at harrowgate  and used to play  high  though unknown to the percivals  of course  at billiards with mr   luttridge  a  man   i confess  i disliked  always   even when i carried  the election for them  but no matter  it is not from enmity i speak now   but it is very well known that luttridge has but a small fortune  and  yet lives as if he had a large one  and all the young men who like high  play are sure to be well received at his house  now  i hope mr  vincent  is not well received on that footing      since my lady delacour and i have been such good friends   continued  his lordship   i have dropped all connexion with the luttridges  so  cannot go there myself  moreover  i do not wish to be tempted to lose  any more thousands to the lady  but you never play  and you are not  likely to be tempted to it now  so you will oblige me and lady delacour  if you will go to luttridge s to night  she is always charmed to see  you  and you will easily discover how the land lies  mr  vincent is  certainly a very agreeable  open hearted young man  but  if he game  god  forbid that miss portman should ever be his wife       god forbid   said clarence hervey      the man   resumed lord delacour   must  in my opinion  be very superior  indeed who is deserving of belinda portman  oh  mr  hervey  you do  not  you cannot know her merit  as i do  it is one thing  sir  to see  a fine girl in a ball room  and another  quite another  to live in  the house with her for months  and to see her  as i have seen belinda  portman  in every day life  as one may call it   then  it is one can  judge of the real temper  manners  and character  and never woman had  so sweet a temper  such charming manners  such a fair  open  generous   decided yet gentle character  as this miss portman       your lordship speaks  con amore    said clarence      i speak  mr  hervey  from the bottom of my soul   cried lord delacour   pulling in his horse  and stopping short   i should be an unfeeling   ungrateful brute  if i were not sensible of the obligations  yes  the  obligations  which my lady delacour and i have received from belinda  portman  why  sir  she has been the peacemaker between us  but we will  not talk of that now  let us think of her affairs  if mr  vincent once  gets into mrs  luttridge s cursed set  there s no knowing where it will  end  i speak from my own experience  for i really never was fond of high  play  and yet  when i got into that set  i could not withstand it  i  lost by hundreds and thousands  and so will he  before he is aware of  it  no doubt  mrs  luttridge will look upon him as her dupe  and make  him such  i always  but this is between ourselves  suspected that i  did not lose my last thousand to her fairly  now  hervey  you know the  whole  do try and save mr  vincent  for belinda portman s sake      clarence hervey shook hands with lord delacour  with a sentiment of real  gratitude and affection  and assured him that his confidence was not  misplaced  his lordship little suspected that he had been soliciting him  to save his rival  clarence s love was not of that selfish sort which  the moment that it is deprived of hope sinks into indifference  or is  converted into hatred  belinda could not be his  but  in the midst of  the bitterest regret  he was supported by the consciousness of his  own honour and generosity  he felt a noble species of delight in the  prospect of promoting the happiness of the woman upon whom his  fondest affections had been fixed  and he rejoiced to feel that he had  sufficient magnanimity to save a rival from ruin  he was even determined  to make that rival his friend  notwithstanding the prepossession which   he clearly perceived  mr  vincent felt against him      his jealousy will be extinguished the moment he knows my real  situation   said clarence to himself   he will be convinced that i have  a soul incapable of envy  and  if he suspect my love for belinda  he  will respect the strength of mind with which i can command my passions   i take it for granted that mr  vincent must possess a heart and  understanding such as i should desire in a friend  or he could never  be  what he is to belinda      full of these generous sentiments  clarence waited with impatience for  the hour when he might present himself at mrs  luttridge s  he went  there so early in the evening  that he found the drawing room quite  empty  the company  who had been invited to dine  had not yet left  the dining room  and the servants had but just set the card tables and  lighted the candles  mr  hervey desired that nobody should be disturbed  by his coming so early  and  fortunately  mrs  luttridge was detained  some minutes by lady newland s lingering glass of madeira  in the mean  time  clarence executed his design  from his former observations  and  from the hints that lord delacour had let fall  he suspected that  there was sometimes in this house not only high play  but foul play   he recollected that once  when he played there at billiards  he had  perceived that the table was not perfectly horizontal  and it occurred  to him  that perhaps the e o table might be so contrived as to put  the fortunes of all who played at it in the power of the proprietor   clarence had sufficient ingenuity to invent the method by which this  might be done  and he had the infallible means in his possession of  detecting the fraud  the e o table was in an apartment adjoining to  the drawing room  he found his way to it  and he discovered  beyond a  possibility of doubt  that it was constructed for the purposes of fraud   his first impulse was to tell this immediately to mr  vincent  to  put him on his guard  but  upon reflection  he determined to keep his  discovery to himself  till he was satisfied whether that gentleman had  or had not any passion for play      if he have   thought clarence   it is of the utmost consequence to miss  portman that he should early in life receive a shock that may leave an  indelible impression upon his mind  to save him a few hours of remorse   i will not give up the power of doing him the most essential service  i  will let him go on  if he be so inclined  to the very verge of ruin  and despair  i will let him feel all the horrors of a gamester s fate   before i tell him that i have the means to save him  mrs  luttridge  must  when i call upon her  refund whatever he may lose  she will not  brave public shame  she cannot stand a public prosecution      scarcely had clarence arranged his scheme  when he heard the voices of  the ladies  who were coming up stairs     mrs  luttridge made her appearance  accompanied by a very pretty   modish  affected young lady  miss annabella luttridge  her niece  her  little coquettish airs were lost upon clarence hervey  whose eye was  intently fixed upon the door  watching for the entrance of mr  vincent   he was one of the dinner party  and he came up soon after the ladies   he seemed prepared for the sight of mr  hervey  to whom he bowed with  a cold  haughty air  and then addressed himself to miss annabella  luttridge  who showed the most obvious desire to attract his attention     from all that passed this evening  mr  hervey was led to suspect   notwithstanding the reasons which made it apparently improbable  that  the fair annabella was the secret cause of mr  vincent s frequent visits  at her aunt s  it was natural that clarence should be disposed to this  opinion  from the circumstances of his own situation  during three hours  that he stayed at mrs  luttridge s  mr  vincent never joined any of  the parties at play  but  just as he was going away  he heard some one  say   how comes it  vincent  that you ve been idle all night   this  question revived mr  hervey s suspicions  and  uncertain what report he  should make to lord delacour  he resolved to defer making any  till he  had farther opportunities of judging     when mr  hervey asked himself how it was possible that the pupil of mr   percival could become a gamester  he forgot that mr  vincent had not  been educated by his guardian  that he had lived in the west indies  till he was eighteen  and that he had only been under the care of mr   percival for a few years  after his habits and character were in a great  measure formed  the taste for gambling he had acquired whilst he was a  child  but  as it was then confined to trifles  it had been passed over   as a thing of no consequence  a boyish folly  that would never grow  up with him  his father used to see him  day after day  playing with  eagerness at games of chance  with his negroes  or with the sons of  neighbouring planters  yet he was never alarmed  he was too intent upon  making a fortune for his family to consider how they would spend it   and he did not foresee that this boyish fault might be the means of his  son s losing  in a few hours  the wealth which he had been many years  amassing  when young vincent came over to england  mr  percival had not  immediate opportunities of discovering this particular foible in his  ward  but he perceived that in his mind there was that presumptuous  belief in his special good fortune which naturally leads to the love  of gambling  instead of lecturing him  his guardian appealed to his  understanding  and took opportunities of showing him the ruinous  effects of high play in real life  young vincent was touched  and  as  he thought  convinced  but his emotion was stronger than his  conviction  his feelings were always more powerful than his reason   his detestation of the selfish character of a gamester was felt and  expressed with enthusiasm and eloquence  and his indignation rose  afterwards at the slightest hint that  he  might ever in future be  tempted to become what he abhorred  unfortunately he disdained prudence   as the factitious virtue of inferior minds  he thought that the   feelings  of a man of honour were to be his guide in the first and last  appeal  and for his conduct through life  as a man and as a gentleman   he proudly professed to trust to the sublime instinct of a good heart   his guardian s doubts of the infallibility and even of the existence of  this moral instinct wounded mr  vincent s pride instead of alarming his  understanding  and he was rather eager than averse to expose himself to  the danger  that he might prove his superiority to the temptation  how  different are the feelings in different situations  yet often as  this has been repeated  how difficult it is to impress the truth upon  inexperienced  sanguine minds   whilst young vincent was immediately  under his guardian s eye at oakly park  his safety from vice appeared  to him inglorious  he was impatient to sally forth into the world   confident rather of his innate than acquired virtue     when he first became acquainted with mrs  luttridge at harrowgate  he  knew that she was a professed gambler  and he despised the character   yet without reflecting on the danger  or perhaps for the pleasure of  convincing mr  percival that he was superior to it  he continued his  visits  for some time he was a passive spectator  billiards  however   was a game of address  not chance  there was a billiard table at  oakly park  as well as at mr  luttridge s  and he had played with his  guardian  why  then  should he not play with mr  luttridge  he did play   his skill was admired  he betted  and his bets were successful  but he  did not call this gaming  for the bets were not to any great amount  and  it was only playing at billiards  mr  percival was delayed in town some  weeks longer than usual  and he knew nothing of the manner in which his  young friend spent his time  as soon as mr  vincent heard of his  arrival at oakly park  he left half finished his game at billiards   and  fortunately for him  the charms of belinda made him forget for  some months that such a thing as a billiard table existed  all that had  happened at mr  luttridge s passed from his mind as a dream  and whilst  his heart was agitated by his new passion  he could scarcely believe  that he had ever been interested by any other feelings  he was surprised  when he accidentally recollected the eagerness with which he used to   amuse  himself in mr  luttridge s company  but he was certain that  all this was passed for ever  and precisely because he was under the  dominion of one strong passion  he thought he could never be under the  dominion of another  thus persisting in his disdain of reason as a moral  guide  mr  vincent thought  acted  and suffered as a man of feeling   scarcely had belinda left oakly park for one week when the ennui  consequent to violent passion became insupportable  and to console  himself for her absence he flew to the billiard table  emotion of some  kind or other was become necessary to him  he said that not to feel was  not to live  and soon the suspense  the anxiety  the hopes  the fears   the perpetual vicissitudes of a gamester s life  seemed to him almost  as delightful as those of a lover s  deceived by these appearances  mrs   luttridge thought that his affection for belinda either was or might  be conquered  and her hopes of obtaining his fortune for her niece  annabella revived  as mr  vincent could not endure mrs  freke  she  abstained  at her friend s particular desire  from appearing at her  house whilst he was there  and mrs  luttridge interested him much in her  own favour  by representing her indignation at  harriot s  conduct to  be such that it had occasioned a total breach in their friendship  mrs   freke s sudden departure from harrowgate confirmed the probability of  this quarrel  yet these two ladies were secretly leagued together in a  design of breaking off mr  vincent s match with belinda  against whom  mrs  freke had vowed revenge  the anonymous letter  which she hoped  would work her purpose  produced  however  an effect totally unexpected  upon his generous mind  he did not guess the writer  but his indignation  against such base accusations burst forth with a violence that  astounded mrs  luttridge  his love for belinda appeared ten times more  enthusiastic than before  the moment she was accused  he felt himself  her defender  as well as her lover  he was dispossessed of the evil  spirit of gambling as if by a miracle  and the billiard table  and  mrs  luttridge  and miss annabella  vanished from his view  he breathed  nothing but love  he would ask no permission  he would wait for none  from belinda  he declared that instant he would set out in search of  her  and he would tear that infamous letter to atoms in her presence   he would show her how impossible suspicion was to his nature  the first  violence of the hurricane mrs  luttridge could not stand  and thought  not of opposing  but whilst his horses and curricle were getting ready   she took such an affectionate leave of his dog juba  and she protested  so much that she and annabella should not know how to live without poor  juba  that mr  vincent  who was excessively fond of his dog  could  not help sympathizing in their sorrow  reasoning just as well as they  wished  he extended his belief in their affection for this animal  to friendship  if not love  for his master  he could not grant mrs   luttridge s earnest supplication to leave the dog behind him under her  protection  but he promised  and laid his hand upon his heart when he  promised  that juba should wait upon mrs  luttridge as soon as she went  to town  this appointment being made  miss annabella permitted herself  to be somewhat consoled  it would be injustice to omit that she did  all that could be done by a cambric handkerchief to evince delicate  sensibility in this parting scene  mrs  luttridge also deserves her  share of praise for the manner in which she reproved her niece for  giving way to her feelings  and for the address with which she wished to  heaven that poor annabella had the calm philosophic temper of which miss  portman was  she understood  a most uncommon example     as mr  vincent drove toward london he reflected upon these last words   and he could not help thinking that if belinda had more faults she would  be more amiable     these thoughts were  however  driven from his mind  and scarcely left  a trace behind them  when he once more saw and conversed with her  the  dignity  sincerity  and kindness which she showed the evening that he  put the anonymous letter into her hands charmed and touched him  and his  real feelings and his enthusiasm conspired to make him believe that his  whole happiness depended on her smiles  the confession which she made  to him of her former attachment to clarence hervey  as it raised in  vincent s mind strong emotions of jealousy  increased his passion  as much as it piqued his pride  and she appeared in a new and highly  interesting light when he discovered that the coldness of manner  which he had attributed to want of sensibility arose probably from its  excess  that her heart should have been preoccupied was more tolerable  to him than the belief of her settled indifference  he was so intent  upon these delightful varieties in his love for belinda that it was not  till he had received a reproachful note from mrs  luttridge  to remind  him of his promised visit with juba  that he could prevail upon himself  to leave twickenham  even for a few hours  lady delacour s hatred  or fear of juba  which he accidentally mentioned to miss annabella   appeared to her and to her aunt  the most extraordinary thing upon  earth   and when it was contrasted with their excessive fondness  it  seemed to him indeed unaccountable  from pure consideration for her  ladyship s nerves  mrs  luttridge petitioned vincent to leave the dog  with her  that helena might not be in such imminent danger from   the animal s monstrous jaws   the petition was granted  and as the  petitioners foresaw  juba became to them a most useful auxiliary   juba s master called daily to see him  and sometimes when he came in the  morning mrs  luttridge was not at home  so that his visits were repeated  in the evening  and the evening in london is what in other places is  called the night  mrs  luttridge s nights could not be passed without  deep play  the sight of the e o table at first shocked mr  vincent  he  thought of mr  percival  and he turned away from it  but to his  active social disposition it was extremely irksome to stand idle and  uninterested where all were busy and eager in one common pursuit  to his  generous temper it seemed ungentlemanlike to stand by the silent  censor of the rest of the company  and when he considered of how little  importance a few hundreds or even thousands could be to a man of his  large fortune  he  could not help feeling  that it was sordid  selfish   avaricious  to dread their possible loss  and thus social spirit   courage  generosity  all conspired to carry our man of feeling to the  gaming table  once there  his ruin was inevitable  mrs  luttridge   whilst she held his doom in her power  hesitated only whether it would  be more her interest to marry him to her niece  or to content herself  with his fortune  his passion for belinda  which she saw had been by  some means or other increased  in spite of the anonymous letter  gave  her little hopes of annabella s succeeding  even with the assistance  of juba and delicate sensibility  so the aunt  careless of her niece s  disappointment  determined that mr  vincent should be  her  victim  and  sensible that she must not give him time for reflection  she hurried  him on  till  in the course of a few evenings spent at the e o table   he lost not only thousands  but tens of thousands  one lucky night   she assured him  would set all to rights  the run could not always be  against him  and fortune must change in his favour  if he tried her with  sufficient perseverance     the horror  the agony of mind  which he endured at this sudden ruin  which seemed impending over him  the recollection of belinda  of mr   percival  almost drove him to distraction  he retreated from the e o  table one night  swearing that he never would hazard another guinea  but  his ruin was not yet complete  he had thousands yet to lose  and mrs   luttridge would not thus relinquish her prey  she persuaded him to try  his fortune  once  more  she now suffered him to regain courage  by  winning back some of his own money  his mind was relieved from the sense  of immediate danger  he rejoiced to be saved from the humiliation of  confessing his losses to mr  percival and belinda  the next day he saw  her with unusual pleasure  and this was the very morning clarence hervey  paid his visit  the imprudence of lady delacour  joined perhaps to his  own consciousness that he had a secret fault  which ought to lower him  in the esteem of his mistress  made him misinterpret every thing that  passed  his jealousy was excited in the most sudden and violent manner   he flew from lady delacour s to mrs  luttridge s  he was soothed  and flattered by the apparent kindness with which he was received by  annabella and her aunt  but after dinner  when one of the servants  whispered to mrs  luttridge  who sat next to him  that mr  clarence  hervey was above stairs  he gave such a start  that the fair annabella s  lap did not escape a part of the bumper of wine which he was going to  drink to her health  in the confusion and apologies which this accident  occasioned  mrs  luttridge had time to consider what might be the cause  of the start  and she combined her suspicions so quickly and judiciously  that she guessed the truth  that he feared to be seen at the e o table  by a person who might find it for his interest to tell the truth to  belinda portman   mr  vincent   said she  in a low voice   i have such  a terrible headache  that i am fit for nothing  i am not  up  to e o  to night  so you must wait for your revenge till to morrow      mr  vincent was heartily glad to be relieved from his engagement  and he  endeavoured to escape clarence s suspicions  by devoting his whole time  this evening to annabella  not in the least apprehensive that mr  hervey  would return the next night  mr  vincent was at the e o table at the  usual hour  for he was excessively anxious to regain what he had lost   not so much for the sake of the money  which he could afford to lose   but lest the defalcation in his fortune should lead mr  percival to the  knowledge of the means which had occasioned it  he could not endure   after his high vaunts  to see himself humbled by his rash confidence in  himself  and he secretly vowed  that if he could but reinstate himself   by one night s good luck  he would for ever quit the society of  gamblers  a few months before this time  he would have scorned the idea  of concealing any part of his conduct  any one of his actions  from  his best friend  mr  percival  but his pride now reconciled him to the  meanness of concealment  and here  the acuteness of his feelings was  to his own mind an excuse for dissimulation  so fallacious is moral  instinct  unenlightened or uncontrolled by reason and religion     mr  vincent was disappointed in his hopes of regaining what he had lost   this was not the fortunate night  which mrs  luttridge s prognostics  had vainly taught him to expect  he played on  however  with all the  impetuosity of his natural temper  his judgment forsook him  he scarcely  knew what he said or did  and  in the course of a few hours  he was  worked up to such a pitch of insanity  that in one desperate moment he  betted nearly all that he was worth in the world  and lost  he stood  like one stupified  the hum of voices scarcely reached his ear  he saw  figures moving before him  but he did not distinguish who or what they  were     supper was announced  and the room emptied fast  whilst he remained  motionless leaning on the e o table  he was roused by mrs  luttridge  saying  as she passed   don t you sup to night  mr  hervey    vincent  looked up  and saw clarence hervey opposite to him  his countenance  instantly changed  and the lightning of anger flashed through the gloom  of despair  he uttered not a syllable  but his looks said   how is this   sir  here again to night to watch me   to enjoy my ruin   to be ready to  carry the first news of it to belinda      at this last thought  vincent struck his closed hand with violence  against his forehead  and rushing by mr  hervey  who in vain attempted  to speak to him  he pressed into the midst of the crowd on the stairs   and let himself be carried along with them into the supper room  at  supper he took his usual seat between mrs  luttridge and the fair  annabella  and  as if determined to brave the observing eyes of clarence  hervey  who was at the same table  he affected extravagant gaiety  he  ate  drank  talked  and laughed  more than any of the company  toward  the end of the supper  his dog  who was an inmate at mrs  luttridge s   licked his hand to put him in mind that he had given him nothing to eat      drink  juba   drink  and never have done  boy   cried vincent  holding  a bumper of wine to the dog s mouth   he s the only dog i ever saw  taste wine   then snatching up some of the flowers  which ornamented the  table  he swore that juba should henceforward be called anacreon  and  that he deserved to be crowned with roses by the hand of beauty  the  fair annabella instantly took a hothouse rose from her bosom  and  assisted in making the garland  with which she crowned the new anacreon   insensible to his honours  the dog  who was extremely hungry  turned  suddenly to mrs  luttridge  by whom he had  till this night  regularly  been fed with the choicest morsels  and lifting up his huge paw  laid  it  as he had been wont to do  upon her arm  she shook it off  he   knowing nothing of the change in his master s affairs  laid the paw  again upon her arm  and with that familiarity to which he had long been  encouraged  raised his head almost close to the lady s cheek      down  juba   down  sir  down   cried mrs  luttridge  in a sharp voice      down  juba   down  sir   repeated mr  vincent  in a tone of bitter  feeling  all his assumed gaiety forsaking him at this instant   down   juba   down  sir  down   as low as your master  thought he  and pushing  back his chair  he rose from table  and precipitately left the room     little notice was taken of his retreat  the chairs closed in  and  the gap which his vacant place left was visible but for a moment  the  company were as gay as before  the fair annabella smiled with a grace  as attractive  and mrs  luttridge exulted in the success of her  schemes  whilst her victim was in the agonies of despair     clarence hervey  who had watched every change of vincent s countenance   saw the agony of soul with which he rose from the table  and quitted the  room  he suspected his purpose  and followed him immediately  but mr   vincent had got out of the house before he could overtake him  which  way he was gone no one could tell  for no one had seen him  the only  information he could gain was  that he might possibly be heard of at  nerot s hotel  or at governor montford s  in portland place  the hotel  was but a few yards from mrs  luttridge s  clarence went there directly   he asked for mr  vincent  one of the waiters said  that he was not yet  come in  but another called out   mr  vincent  sir  did you say  i have  just shown him up to his room       which is the room   i must see him instantly   cried hervey      not to night  you can t see him now  sir  mr  vincent won t let you  in  i can assure you  sir  i went up myself three minutes ago  with some  letters  that came whilst he was away  but he would not let me in  i  heard him double lock the door  and he swore terribly  i can t go up  again at this time o night  for my life i dare not  sir       where is his own man   has mr  vincent any servant here   mr  vincent s  man   cried clarence   let me see him       you can t  sir  mr  vincent has just sent his black  the only servant  he has here  out on some message  indeed  sir  there s no use in going  up   continued the waiter  as clarence sprang up two or three stairs  at once   mr  vincent has desired nobody may disturb him  i give you my  word  sir  he ll be very angry  and  besides   twould be to no purpose   for he ll not unlock the door       is there but one door to the room   said mr  hervey  and  as he asked  the question  he pulled a guinea out of his pocket  and touched the  waiter s hand with it      oh  now i recollect  yes  sir  there s a private door through a closet   may be that mayn t be fastened      clarence put the guinea into the waiter s hand  who instantly showed him  the way up the back staircase to the door that opened into mr  vincent s  bed chamber      leave me now   whispered he   and make no noise      the man withdrew  and as mr  hervey went close to the concealed door   to try if it was fastened  he distinctly heard a pistol cocked  the door  was not fastened  he pushed it softly open  and saw the unfortunate man  upon his knees  the pistol in his hand  his eyes looking up to heaven   clarence was in one moment behind him  and  seizing hold of the pistol   he snatched it from vincent s grasp with so much calm presence of mind  and dexterity  that  although the pistol was cocked  it did not go off      mr  hervey   exclaimed vincent  starting up  astonishment overpowered  all other sensations  but the next instant recovering the power of  speech   is this the conduct of a gentleman  mr  hervey  of a man of  honour   cried he   thus to intrude upon my privacy  to be a spy upon my  actions  to triumph in my ruin  to witness my despair  to rob me of the  only       he looked wildly at the pistol which clarence held in his hand  then  snatching up another  which lay upon the table  he continued   you are  my enemy  i know it  you are my rival  i know it  belinda loves you   nay  affect not to start  this is no time for dissimulation  belinda  loves you  you know it  for her sake  for your own  put me out of the  world  put me out of torture  it shall not be called murder  it shall  be called a duel  you have been a spy upon my actions  i demand  satisfaction  if you have one spark of honour or of courage within you   mr  hervey  show it now  fight me  sir  openly as man to man  rival to  rival  enemy to enemy  fire       if you fire upon me  you will repent it   replied clarence calmly   for  i am not your enemy  i am not your rival       you  are    interrupted vincent  raising his voice to the highest pitch  of indignation   you are my rival  though you dare not avow it  the  denial is base  false  unmanly  oh  belinda  is this the being you  prefer to  me   gamester  wretch  as i am  my soul never stooped to  falsehood  treachery i abhor  courage  honour  and a heart worthy  of belinda  i possess  i beseech you  sir   continued he  addressing  himself  in a tremulous tone of contempt  to mr  hervey   i beseech you   sir  to leave me to my own feelings  and to myself       you are not yourself at this moment  and i cannot leave you to such  mistaken feelings   replied hervey   command yourself for a moment  and  hear me  use your reason  and you will soon be convinced that i am your  friend       my friend       your friend  for what purpose did i come here  to snatch this pistol  from your hand  if it were my interest  my wish  that you were out of  the world  why did i prevent you from destroying yourself  do you think   that  the action of an enemy  use your reason       i cannot   said vincent  striking his forehead   i know not what to  think  i am not master of myself  i conjure you  sir  for your own sake   to leave me       for my  own  sake   repeated hervey  disdainfully   i am not thinking  of myself  nor can any thing you have said provoke me from my purpose   my purpose is to save you from ruin  for the sake of a woman  whom   though i am no longer your rival  i have loved longer  if not better   than you have      there was something so open in hervey s countenance  such a strong  expression of truth in his manner  that it could not be resisted  and  vincent  in an altered voice  exclaimed   you acknowledge that you have  loved belinda  and could you cease to love her  impossible   and  loving  her  must you not detest me       no   said clarence  holding out his hand to him   i wish to be your  friend  i have not the baseness to wish to deprive others of happiness  because i cannot enjoy it myself  in one word  to put you at ease with  me for ever  i have no pretensions  i can have none  to miss portman   i am engaged to another woman  in a few days you will hear of my  marriage      mr  vincent threw the pistol from him  and gave his hand to hervey      pardon what i said to you just now   cried he   i knew not what  i said  i spoke in the agony of despair  your purpose is most  generous  but it is in vain  you come too late  i am ruined  past all  hope      he folded his arms  and his eyes reverted involuntarily to his pistols      the misery that you have this night experienced   said mr  hervey   was  necessary to the security of your future happiness       happiness   repeated vincent   happiness  there is no happiness left  for me  my doom is fixed  fixed by my own folly  my own rash  headstrong  folly  madman that i was  what could tempt me to the gaming table   oh  if i could recall but a few days  a few hours of my existence  but  remorse is vain  prudence comes too late  do you know   said he  fixing  his eyes upon hervey   do you know that i am a beggar  that i have not a  farthing left upon earth  go to belinda  tell her so  tell her  that if  she had ever the slightest regard for me  i deserve it no longer  tell  her to forget  despise  detest me  give her joy that she has escaped  having a gamester for a husband       i will   said clarence   i will  if you please  tell her what i believe  to be true  that the agony you have felt this night  the dear bought  experience you have had  will be for ever a warning       a warning   interrupted vincent   oh  that it could yet be useful to  me   but i tell you it comes too late  nothing can save me        i  can   said mr  hervey   swear to me  for belinda s sake  solemnly  swear to me  that you will never more trust your happiness and hers  to the hazard of a die  swear that you will never more  directly or  indirectly  play at any game of chance  and i will restore to you the  fortune that you have lost      mr  vincent stood as if suspended between ecstasy and despair  he dared  not trust his senses  with a fervent and solemn adjuration he made the  vow that was required of him  and clarence then revealed to him the  secret of the e o table      when mrs  luttridge knows that i have it in my power to expose her to  public shame  she will instantly refund all that she has iniquitously  won from you  even among gamblers she would be blasted for ever by this  discovery  she knows it  and if she dared to brave public opinion  we  have then a sure resource in the law  prosecute her  the laws of honour   as well as the laws of the land  will support the prosecution  but she  will never let the affair go into a court of justice  i will see her  early  as early as i can to morrow  and put you out of suspense       most generous of human beings   exclaimed vincent   i cannot express to  you what i feel  but your own heart  your own approbation        farewell  good night   interrupted clarence   i see that i have made a  friend  i was determined that belinda s husband should be my friend  i  have succeeded beyond my hopes  and now i will  intrude  no longer    said he  as he closed the door after him  his sensations at this instant  were more delightful even than those of the man he had relieved from  the depth of despair  how wisely has providence made the benevolent and  generous passions the most pleasurable           chapter xxix     a jew       in the silence of the night  when the hurry of action was over  and the  enthusiasm of generosity began to subside  the words  which had escaped  from mr  vincent in the paroxysm of despair and rage  the words     belinda loves you    recurred to clarence hervey  and it required all  his power over himself to banish the sound from his ear  and the idea  from his mind  he endeavoured to persuade himself that these words were  dictated merely by sudden jealousy  and that there could be no real  foundation for the assertion  perhaps this belief was a necessary  support to his integrity  he reflected  that  at all events  his  engagement with virginia could not be violated  his proffered services  to mr  vincent could not be withdrawn  he was firm and consistent   before two o clock the next day  vincent received from clarence this  short note      enclosed is mrs  luttridge s acknowledgment  that she has no claims  upon you  in consequence of what passed last night  i said nothing about  the money she had previously won  as i understand you have paid it      the lady fell into fits  but it would not do  the husband attempted to  bully me  i told him i should be at his service  after he had made the  whole affair public  by calling you out      i would have seen you myself this morning  but that i am engaged with  lawyers and marriage settlements      yours sincerely      clarence hervey      overjoyed at the sight of mrs  luttridge s acknowledgment  vincent  repeated his vow never more to hazard himself in her dangerous society   he was impatient to see belinda  and  full of generous and grateful  sentiments  in his first moment of joy  he determined to conceal nothing  from her  to make at once the confession of his own imprudence and the  eulogium of clarence hervey s generosity  he was just setting out for  twickenham  when he was sent for by his uncle  governor montford  who  had business to settle with him  relative to his west india estates  he  spent the remainder of the morning with his uncle  and there he received  a charming letter from belinda  that letter which she had written and  sent whilst lady delacour was reading clarence hervey s packet  it would  have cured vincent of jealousy  even if he had not  in the interim  seen  mr  hervey  and learnt from him the news of his approaching marriage   miss portman  at the conclusion of her letter  informed him that lady  delacour purposed being in berkeley square the next day  that they were  to spend a week in town  on account of mrs  margaret delacour  who  had promised her ladyship a visit  and to go to twickenham would be a  formidable journey to an infirm old lady  who seldom stirred out of her  house     whatever displeasure lady delacour felt towards her friend belinda   on account of her coldness to mr  hervey  and her steadiness to mr   vincent  had by this time subsided  angry people  who express their  passion  as it has been justly said  always speak worse than they think   this was usually the case with her ladyship     the morning after they arrived in town  she came into belinda s room   with an air of more than usual sprightliness and satisfaction   great  news   great news   extraordinary news   but it is very imprudent  to excite your expectations  my dear belinda  pray  did you hear a  wonderful noise in the square a little while ago       yes  i thought i heard a great bustle  but marriott appeased my  curiosity  by saying that it was only a battle between two dogs       it is well if this battle between two dogs do not end in a duel between  two men   said lady delacour      this prospect of mischief seems to have put your ladyship in  wonderfully good spirits   said belinda  smiling      but what do you think i have heard of mr  vincent   continued lady  delacour   that miss annabella luttridge is dying for love of him  or  of his fortune  knowing  as i do  the vanity of mankind  i suppose that  your mr  vincent  all perfect as he is  was flattered by the little  coquette  and perhaps he condescends to repay her in the same coin  i  take it for granted  for i always fill up the gaps in a story my own  way  i take it for granted that mr  vincent got into some entanglement  with her  and that this has been the cause of the quarrel with the aunt   that there has been a quarrel is certain  for your friend juba told  marriott so  his massa swore that he would never go to mrs  luttridge s  again  and this morning he took the decisive measure of sending to  request that his dog might be returned  juba went for his namesake  miss  annabella luttridge was the person who delivered up the dog  and she  desired the black to tell his master  with her compliments  that juba s  collar was rather too tight  and she begged that he would not fail to  take it off as soon as he could  perhaps  my dear  you are as simple  as the poor negro  and suspect no  finesse  in this message  miss  luttridge  aware that the faithful fellow was too much in your interests  to be either persuaded or bribed to carry a billet doux from any other  lady to his master  did not dare to trust him upon this occasion  but  she had the art to make him carry her letter without his knowing it    colin maillard   vulgarly called  blind man s buff   was  some time  ago  a favourite play amongst the parisian ladies  now  hide and seek   will be brought into fashion  i suppose  by the fair annabella  judge  of her talents for the game by this instance   she hid her billet doux  within the lining of juba s collar  the dog  unconscious of his dignity  as an ambassador  or rather as a charge d affaires  set out on his  way home  as he was crossing berkeley square he was met by sir philip  baddely and his dog  the baronet s insolent favourite bit the black s  heels  juba  the dog  resented the injury immediately  and a furious  combat ensued  in the height of the battle juba s collar fell off  sir  philip baddely espied the paper that was sewed to the lining  and seized  upon it immediately  the negro caught hold of it at the same instant   the baronet swore  the black struggled  the baronet knocked him down   the great dog left his canine antagonist that moment  flew at your  baronet  and would have eaten him up at three mouthfuls  if sir philip  had not made good his retreat to dangerfield s circulating library  the  negro s head was terribly cut by the sharp point of a stone  and his  ankle was sprained  but  as he has just told me  he did not feel this  till afterward  he started up  and pursued his master s enemy  sir  philip was actually reading miss luttridge s billet doux aloud when the  black entered the library  he reclaimed his master s property with great  intrepidity  and a gentleman who was present took his part immediately      in the mean time  lord delacour  who had been looking at the battle  from our breakfast room window  determined to go over to dangerfield s   to see what was the matter  and how all this would end  he entered the  library just as the gentleman who had volunteered in favour of poor juba  was disputing with sir philip  the bleeding negro told my lord  in as  plain words as he could  the cause of the dispute  and lord delacour   who  to do him justice  is a man of honour  joined instantly in his  defence  the baronet thought proper at length to submit  and he left  the field of battle  without having any thing to say for himself  but   damme   very extraordinary  damme     or words to that effect       now  lord delacour  besides being a man of honour  is also a man of  humanity  i know that i cannot oblige you more  my dear belinda  than  by seasoning my discourse with a little conjugal flattery  my lord  was concerned to see the poor black writhing in pain  and with the  assistance of the gentleman who had joined in his defence  he brought  juba across the square to our house  guess for what   to try upon the  strained ankle an infallible quack balsam recommended to him by the  dowager lady boucher  i was in the hall when they brought the poor  fellow in  marriott was called   mrs  marriott   cried my lord   pray  let us have lady boucher s infallible balsam  this instant   had you but  seen the eagerness of face  or heard the emphasis  with which he said    infallible  balsam   you must let me laugh at the recollection  one  human smile must pass  and be forgiven       the smile may be the more readily forgiven   said belinda   since i am  sure you are conscious that it reflected almost as much upon yourself as  upon lord delacour       why  yes  belief in a quack doctor is full as bad as belief in a quack  balsam  i allow  your observation is so malicious  because so just  that  to punish you for it  i will not tell you the remainder of my story for  a week to come  and i assure you that the best part of it i have left  untold  to return to our friend mr  vincent   could you but know what  reasons i have  at this instant  for wishing him in jamaica  you would  acknowledge that i am truly candid in confessing that i believe  my suspicions about e o were unfounded  and i am truly generous in  admitting that you are right to treat him with justice      this last enigmatical sentence belinda could not prevail upon lady  delacour to explain     in the evening mr  vincent made his appearance  lady delacour  immediately attacked him with raillery  on the subject of the fair  annabella  he was rejoiced to perceive that her suspicions took this  turn  and that nothing relative to the transaction in which clarence  hervey had been engaged had transpired  vincent wavered in his  resolution to confess the truth to belinda  though he had determined  upon this in the first moment of joyful enthusiasm  yet the delay of  four and twenty hours had made a material change in his feelings  his  most virtuous resolves were always rather the effect of sudden impulse  than of steady principle  but when the tide of passion had swept away  the landmarks  he had no method of ascertaining the boundaries of right  and wrong  upon the present occasion his love for belinda confounded  all his moral calculations  one moment  his feelings as a man of honour  forbade him to condescend to the meanness of dissimulation  but the  next instant his feelings as a lover prevailed  and he satisfied his  conscience by the idea that  as his vow must preclude all danger of  his return to the gaming table in future  it would only be creating  an unnecessary alarm in belinda s mind to speak to her of his past  imprudence  his generosity at first revolted from the thought of  suppressing those praises of clarence hervey  which had been so well  deserved  but his jealousy returned  to combat his first virtuous  impulse  he considered that his own inferiority must by comparison  appear more striking to his mistress  and he sophistically persuaded  himself that it would be for her happiness to conceal the merits of a  rival  to whom she could never be united  in this vacillating state of  mind he continued during the greatest part of the evening  about half an  hour before he took his leave  lady delacour was called out of the room  by mrs  marriott  left alone with belinda  his embarrassment increased   and the unsuspecting kindness of her manner was to him the most bitter  reproach  he stood in silent agony whilst in a playful tone she smiled  and said      where are your thoughts  mr  vincent  if i were of a jealous temper  i  should say with the fair annabella        you would say wrong  then   replied mr  vincent  in a constrained  voice  he was upon the point of telling the truth  but to gain a  reprieve of a few minutes  he entered into a defence of his conduct  towards miss luttridge     the sudden return of lady delacour relieved him from his embarrassment   and they conversed only on general subjects during the remainder of the  evening  and he at last departed  secretly rejoicing that he was  as  he fancied  under the necessity of postponing his explanation  he  even thought of suppressing the history of his transaction with mrs   luttridge  he knew that his secret was safe with clarence hervey  mrs   luttridge would be silent for her own sake  and neither lady delacour  nor belinda had any connexion with her society     a few days afterward  mr  vincent went to gray  the jeweller  for some  trinkets which he had bespoken  lord delacour was there  speaking about  the diamond ring  which gray had promised to dispose of for him  whilst  his lordship and mr  vincent were busy about their own affairs  sir  philip baddely and mr  rochfort came into the shop  sir philip and mr   vincent had never before met  lord delacour  to prevent him from getting  into a quarrel about a lady who was so little worth fighting for as miss  annabella luttridge  had positively refused to tell mr  vincent what he  knew of the affair  or to let him know the name of the gentleman who was  concerned in it     the shopman addressed mr  vincent by his name  and immediately sir  philip whispered to rochfort  that mr  vincent was   the master of the  black    vincent  who unluckily overheard him  instantly asked lord  delacour if that was the gentleman who had behaved so ill to his  servant  lord delacour told him that it was now of no consequence to  inquire   if   said his lordship   either of these gentlemen choose to  accost you  i shall think you do rightly to retort  but for heaven s  sake do not begin the attack      vincent s impetuosity was not to be restrained  he demanded from sir  philip  whether he was the person who had beaten his servant  sir  philip readily obliged him with an answer in the affirmative  and the  consequence was the loss of a finger to the baronet  and a wound in the  side to mr  vincent  which  though it did not endanger his life  yet  confined him to his room for several days  the impatience of his mind  increased his fever  and retarded his recovery     when belinda s first alarm for mr  vincent s safety was over  she  anxiously questioned lord delacour as to the particulars of all that had  passed between mr  vincent and sir philip  that she might judge of the  manner in which her lover had conducted himself  lord delacour  who was  a man of strict truth  was compelled to confess that mr  vincent had  shown more spirit than temper  and more courage than prudence  lady  delacour rejoiced to perceive that this account made belinda uncommonly  serious     mr  vincent now thought himself sufficiently recovered to leave his  room  his physicians  indeed  would have kept him prisoner a few  days longer  but he was too impatient of restraint to listen to their  counsels      juba  tell the doctor  when he comes  that you could not keep me at  home  and that is all that is necessary to be said      he had now summoned courage to acknowledge to belinda all that had  happened  and was proceeding  with difficulty  down stairs  when he was  suddenly struck by the sound of a voice which he little expected at this  moment  a voice he had formerly been accustomed to hear with pleasure   but now it smote him to the heart   it was the voice of mr  percival   for the first time in his life  he wished to deny himself to his friend   the recollection of the e o table  of mrs  luttridge  of mr  percival as  his guardian  and of all the advice he had heard from him as his friend   rushed upon his mind at this instant  conscious and ashamed  he shrunk  back  precipitately returned to his own room  and threw himself into  a chair  breathless with agitation  he listened  expecting to hear mr   percival coming up stairs  and endeavoured to compose himself  that  he might not betray  by his own agitation  all that he wished most  anxiously to conceal  after waiting for some time  he rang the bell  to  make inquiries  the waiter told him that a mr  percival had asked for  him  but  having been told by his black that he was just gone out   the gentleman being  as he said  much hurried  had left a note  for an  answer to which he would call at eight o clock in the evening  vincent  was glad of this short reprieve   alas   thought he   how changed am  i  when i fear to meet my best friend  to what has this one fatal  propensity reduced me      he was little aware of the new difficulties that awaited him     mr  percival s note was as follows          my dear  friend       am not i a happy man  to find a friend in my ci devant ward  but i have  no time for sentiment  nor does it become the character  in which i am  now writing to you  that of a dun  you are so rich  and so prudent  that  the word in capital letters cannot frighten you  lady anne s cousin   poor mr  carysfort  is dead  i am guardian to his boys  they are but ill  provided for  i have fortunately obtained a partnership in a good house  for the second son  ten thousand pounds are wanting to establish him  we  cannot raise the money amongst us  without dunning poor mr  vincent   enclosed is your bond for the purchase money of the little estate you  bought from me last summer  i know that you have double the sum we want  in ready money  so i make no ceremony  let me have the ten thousand this  evening  if you can  as i wish to leave town as soon as possible      yours most sincerely      henry percival      now mr  vincent had lost  and had actually paid to mrs  luttridge   the ready money which had been destined to discharge his debt to mr   percival  he expected fresh remittances from the west indies in the  course of a few weeks  but  in the mean time  he must raise this  money immediately  this he could only do by having recourse to jews  a  desperate expedient  the jew  to whom he applied  no sooner discovered  that mr  vincent was under a necessity of having this sum before eight  o clock in the evening than he became exorbitant in his demands  and the  more impatient this unfortunate young man became  the more difficulties  he raised  at last  a bargain was concluded between them  in which  vincent knew that he was grossly imposed upon  but to this he submitted   for he had no alternative  the jew promised to bring him ten thousand  pounds at five o clock in the evening  but it was half after seven  before he made his appearance  and then he was so dilatory and  circumspect  in reading over and signing the bonds  and in completing  the formalities of the transaction  that before the money was actually  in vincent s possession  one of the waiters of the hotel knocked at the  door to let him know that mr  percival was coming up stairs  vincent  hurried the jew into an adjoining apartment  and bid him wait there   till he should come to finish the business  though totally unsuspicious   mr  percival could not help being struck with the perturbation in which  he found his young friend  vincent immediately began to talk of the  duel  and his friend was led to conclude that his anxiety arose  from this affair  he endeavoured to put him at ease by changing the  conversation  he spoke of the business which brought him to town  and of  the young man whom he was going to place with a banker   i hope   said  he  observing that vincent grew more embarrassed   that my  dunning  you  for this money is not really inconvenient       not in the least  not in the least  i have the money ready  in a few  moments  if you ll be so good as to wait here  i have the money ready in  the next room      at this instant a loud noise was heard  the raised voices of two people  quarrelling  it was juba  the black  and solomon  the jew  mr  vincent  had sent juba out of the way  on some errand  whilst he had been  transacting his affairs with the jew  but the black  having executed  the commission on which he had been sent  returned  and went into his  master s bedchamber  to read at his leisure a letter which he had just  received from his wife  he did not at first see the jew  and he was  spelling out the words of his wife s letter      my dear juba      i take this op por tu       nity  he would have said  but the jew   who had held his breath in to avoid discovery  till he could hold it no  longer  now drew it so loud  that juba started  looked round  and saw  the feet of a man  which appeared beneath the bottom of the window  curtain  where fears of supernatural appearances were out of the  question  our negro was a man of courage  he had no doubt that the man  who was concealed behind the curtain was a robber  but the idea of a  robber did not unnerve him like that of an obeah woman  with presence  of mind worthy of a greater danger  juba took down his master s pistol   which hung over the chimney piece  and marching deliberately up to the  enemy  he seized the jew by the throat  exclaiming       you rob my massa   you dead man  if you rob my massa      terrified at the sight of the pistol  the jew instantly explained who  he was  and producing his large purse  assured juba that he was come to  lend money  and not to take it from his master  but this appeared highly  improbable to juba  who believed his master to be the richest man in the  world  besides  the jew s language was scarcely intelligible to him  and  he saw secret terror in solomon s countenance  solomon had an antipathy  to the sight of a black  and he shrunk from the negro with strong signs  of aversion  juba would not relinquish his hold  each went on talking  in his own angry gibberish as loud as he could  till at last the negro  fairly dragged the jew into the presence of his master and mr  percival     it is impossible to describe mr  vincent s confusion  or mr  percival s  astonishment  the jew s explanation was perfectly intelligible to him   he saw at once all the truth  vincent  overwhelmed with shame  stood the  picture of despair  incapable of uttering a single syllable      there is no necessity to borrow this money on my account   said mr   percival  calmly   and if there were  we could probably have it on more  reasonable terms than this gentleman proposes       i care not on what terms i have it  i care not what becomes of me  i am  undone   cried vincent     mr  percival coolly dismissed the jew  made a sign to juba to leave the  room  and then  addressing himself to vincent  said   i can borrow the  money that i want elsewhere  fear no reproaches from me  i foresaw all  this  you have lost this sum at play  it is well that it was not your  whole fortune  i have only one question to ask you  on which depends my  esteem  have you informed miss portman of this affair       i have not yet told her  but i was actually half down stairs in my way  to tell her       then  mr  vincent  you are still my friend  i know the difficulty of  such an avowal  but it is necessary       cannot you  dear mr  percival  save me the intolerable shame of  confessing my own folly  spare me this mortification  be yourself the  bearer of this intelligence  and the mediator in my favour       i will with pleasure   said mr  percival   i will go this instant  but  i cannot say that i have any hope of persuading belinda to believe in  your being irrevocably reclaimed from the charms of play       indeed  my excellent friend  she may rely upon me  i feel such horror  at the past  such heartfelt resolution against all future temptation   that you may pledge yourself for my total reformation      mr  percival promised that he would exert all his influence  except by  pledging his own honour  to this he could not consent   if i have any  good news for you  i will return as soon as possible  but i will not  be the bearer of any painful intelligence   said he  and he departed   leaving mr  vincent in a state of anxiety  which  to his temper  was a  punishment sufficient for almost any imprudence he could have committed     mr  percival returned no more that night  the next morning mr  vincent  received the following letter from belinda  he guessed his fate  he had  scarcely power to read the words      i promised you that  whenever my own mind should be decided  i would  not hold yours in suspense  yet at this moment i find it difficult to  keep my word      instead of lamenting  as you have often done  that my esteem for your  many excellent qualities never rose beyond the bounds of friendship  we  have now reason to rejoice at this  since it will save us much useless  pain  it spares me the difficulty of conquering a passion that might  be fatal to my happiness  and it will diminish the regret which you may  feel at our separation  i am now obliged to say  that circumstances have  made me certain we could not add to our mutual felicity by any nearer  connexion      the hope of enjoying domestic happiness with a person whose manners   temper  and tastes suited my own  inclined me to listen to your  addresses  but this happiness i could never enjoy with one who has any  propensity to the love of play      for my own sake  as well as for yours  i rejoice that your fortune has  not been materially injured  as this relieves me from the fear that my  present conduct should be imputed to interested motives  indeed  such  is the generosity of your own temper  that in any situation i should  scarcely have reason to apprehend from you such a suspicion      the absolute impossibility of my forming at present a connexion with  another  will prevent you from imagining that i am secretly influenced  by sentiments different from those which i avow  nor can any weak doubts  on this subject expose me to my own reproaches      you perceive  sir  that i am not willing utterly to lose your esteem   even when i renounce  in the most unequivocal manner  all claim upon  your affections  if any thing should appear to you harsh in this letter   i beg you to impute it to the real cause  my desire to spare you all  painful suspense  by convincing you at once that my determination is  irrevocable  with sincere wishes for your happiness  i bid you farewell      belinda portman        a few hours after mr  vincent had read this letter he threw himself into  a post chaise  and set out for germany  he saw that all hopes of being  united to belinda were over  and he hurried as far from her as possible   her letter rather soothed than irritated his temper  her praises of his  generosity were highly gratifying  and they had so powerful an effect  upon his mind  that he was determined to prove that they were deserved   his conscience reproached him with not having made sufficiently  honourable mention of clarence hervey s conduct  on the night when he  was on the point of destroying himself  before he left london he wrote  a full account of this whole transaction  to be given to miss portman  after his departure     belinda was deeply touched by this proof of his generosity  his  letter  his farewell letter  she could not read without great emotion   it was written with true feeling  but in a manly style  without one word  of vain lamentation      what a pity   thought belinda   that with so many good and great  qualities  i should be forced to bid him adieu for ever      though she strongly felt the pain of this separation  yet she could not  recede from her decision  nothing could tempt her to connect herself  with a man who had the fatal taste for play  even mr  percival  much as  he loved his ward  much as he wished for his union with belinda  dared  not pledge his honour for mr  vincent on this point     lady anne percival  in a very kind and sensible letter  expressed the  highest approbation of belinda s conduct  and the most sincere hope that  belinda would still continue to think of her with affection and esteem   though she had been so rash in her advice  and though her friendship had  been apparently so selfish           chapter xxx     news        do not expect that i should pretend to be sorry for mr  vincent   said  lady delacour   let him be as generous and as penitent as he pleases   i am heartily glad that he is on his way to germany  i dare say he will  find in the upper or  lower  circles of the empire some heroine in  the kotzebue taste  who will alternately make him miserable till he  is happy  and happy till he is miserable  he is one of those men who  require great emotions  fine lovers these make for stage effect  but the  worst husbands in the world      i hope  belinda  you give me credit  for having judged better of mr   vincent than lady anne percival did       for having judged worse of him  you mean  lady anne always judges  as  well  as possible of every body       i will allow you to play upon words in a friend s defence  but do not  be alarmed for the reputation of lady anne s judgment  if it will be  any satisfaction to you  i can with thorough sincerity assure you that  i never liked her so well in my life as since i have detected her in  a mistake  it saves her  in my imagination  from the odium of being a  perfect character       and there was something so handsome in her manner of writing to me   when she found out her error   said belinda      very true  and my friend mr  percival behaved handsomely  where  friendships clash  it is not every man who has clearness of head  sufficient to know his duty to his neighbour  mr  percival said no  more than just the thing he ought  for his ward  you have reason to be  obliged to him  and as we are returning thanks to all persons concerned  in our deliverance from this imminent danger  juba  the dog  and juba   the black  and solomon  the jew  ought to come in for their share  for  without that wrestling match of theirs  the truth might never have been  dragged to light  and mr  vincent would have been in due course of  time your lord and master  but the danger is over  you need not look  so terrified  do not be like the man who dropped down dead with terror   when he was shown by daylight the broken bridge which he had galloped  over in the dark      lady delacour was in such high spirits that  without regard to  connexion  she ran on from one subject to another      you have proved to me  my dear   said she   that you are not a girl to  marry  because the day was fixed  or because  things had gone so far    i give you infinite credit for your  civil courage   as dr  x     calls  it  military courage  as he said to me yesterday  military courage  that  seeks the bubble reputation even in the cannon s mouth  may be had  for sixpence a day  but civil courage  such as enabled the princess  parizade  in the arabian tales  to go straight up the hill to her  object  though the magical multitude of advising and abusive voices  continually called to her to turn back  is one of the rarest qualities  in man or woman  and not to be had for love  money  or admiration       you place admiration not only above money  but above love  in your  climax  i perceive   said belinda  smiling      i will give you leave to be as philosophically sarcastic as you please   my dear  if you will only smile  and if you will not look as pale as  seneca s paulina  whose story we heard  from whom       from mr  hervey  i believe       his name was ready upon your lips  i hope he was not far from your  thoughts       no one could be farther from my thoughts   said belinda      well  very likely  i believe it  because you say it  and because it is  impossible       rally me as much as you please  my dear lady delacour  i assure you  that i speak the simple truth       i cannot suspect you of affectation  my dear  therefore honestly tell  me  if clarence hervey were at your feet this instant  would you spurn  him from you       spurn him  no  i would neither spurn him  nor  motion him from me   but  without using any of the terms in the heroine s dictionary          you would refuse him   interrupted lady delacour  with a look of  indignation   you would refuse him       i did not say so  i  believe        you would accept him       i did not say so   i am sure        oh  you would tell him that you were not  accustomed  to him       not exactly in those words  perhaps       well  we shall not quarrel about words   said lady delacour   i only  beg you to remember your own principles  and if ever you are put to  the trial  be consistent  the first thing in a philosopher is to be  consistent       fortunately  for the credit of my philosophy  there is no immediate  danger of its being put to the test       unfortunately  you surely mean  unless you are afraid that it might not  stand the test  but i was going  when i spoke of consistency  to remind  you that all your own and mr  percival s arguments about  first loves   may now  with equal propriety  be turned against you       how  against  me       they are evidently as applicable to second as to first loves  i think       perhaps they are   said belinda   but i really and truly am not  inclined to think of love at present  particularly as there is no  necessity that i should      belinda took up a book  and lady delacour for one half hour abstained  from any farther raillery  but longer than half an hour she could not be  silent on the subject uppermost in her thoughts      if clarence hervey   cried she   were not the most honourable of  blockheads  he might be the most happy of men  this virginia   oh  how i  hate her   i am sure poor clarence cannot love her       because you hate her  or because you hate her without having ever seen  her   said belinda      oh  i know what she must be   replied lady delacour   a soft  sighing   dying damsel  who puts bullfinches into her bosom  smile  smile  my  dear  you cannot help it  in spite of all your generosity  i know you  must think as i do  and wish as i do  that she were at the bottom of the  black sea this instant      lady delacour stood for some minutes musing  and then exclaimed   i will  move heaven and earth to break off this absurd match       good heavens  my dear lady delacour  what do you mean       mean  my dear  i mean what i say  which very few people do  no wonder i  should surprise you       i conjure you   cried belinda   if you have the least regard for my  honour and happiness        i have not the least  but the greatest  and depend upon it  my dear  i  will do nothing that shall injure that  dignity of mind and delicacy of  character   which i admire and love  as much as clarence hervey did  and  does  trust to me  not lady anne percival herself can be more delicate  in her notions of propriety than i am for my friends  and  since  my reformation  i hope i may add  for myself  fear nothing   as she  finished these words  she rang for her carriage   i don t ask you to go  out with me  my dear belinda  i give you leave to sit in this armchair  till i come back again  with your feet upon the fender  a book in  your hand  and this little table beside you  like lady s  s picture of  comfort      lady delacour spent the rest of the morning abroad  and when she  returned home  she gave no account of what she had been doing  or of  what or whom she had seen  this was so unusual  that belinda could not  avoid taking notice of it  notwithstanding her ladyship s eulogium upon  her own delicate sense of propriety  miss portman could not confide   with perfect resignation  in her prudence      your ladyship reproached me once   said she  in a playful tone   for  my provoking want of curiosity  you have completely cured me of this  defect  for never was woman more curious than i am  at this instant  to  know the secret scheme that you have in agitation       have patience a little longer  and the mystery will be unravelled  in  the mean time  trust that every thing i do is for the best  however  as  you have behaved pretty well  i will give you one leading hint  when you  have explained to me what you meant by saying that your heart is not at  present inclined to love  pray  have you quarrelled with love for ever       no  but i can exist without it       have you a heart       i hope so       and it can exist without love  i now understand what was once said to  me by a foolish lordling     of what use is the sun to the dial            company came in  and relieved belinda from any further raillery  lady  boucher and mrs  margaret delacour were  amongst a large party  to dine  at lady delacour s  at dinner  the dowager seized the first auspicious  moment of silence to announce a piece of intelligence  which she  flattered herself would fix the eyes of all the world upon her      so mr  clarence hervey is married at last       married   cried lady delacour  she had sufficient presence of mind  not to look directly at belinda  but she fixed the dowager s eyes  by  repeating   married  are you sure of it       positive  positive  he was privately married yesterday at his aunt   lady almeria s apartments  at windsor  to miss hartley  i told you it  was to be  and now it is over  and a very extraordinary match mr  hervey  has made of it  after all  think of his going at last  and marrying a  girl who has been his mistress for years  nobody will visit her  to be  sure  lady almeria is excessively distressed  she did all she could to  prevail on her brother  the bishop  to marry his nephew  but he very  properly refused  giving it as a reason  that the girl s character was  too well known       i thought the bishop was at spa   interposed a gentleman  whilst the  dowager drew breath      o dear  no  sir  you have been misinformed   resumed she   the bishop  has been returned from spa this great while  and he has refused to see  his nephew  to my certain knowledge  after all  i cannot but pity poor  clarence for being driven into this match  mr  hartley has a prodigious  fine fortune  to be sure  and he hurried things forward at an amazing  rate  to patch up his daughter s reputation  he said  as i am credibly  informed  yesterday morning  that if clarence did not marry the girl  before night  he would carry her and her fortune off the next day to the  west indies  now the fortune was certainly an object       my dear lady boucher   interrupted lord delacour   you must be  misinformed in that particular  fortune is no object to clarence  hervey  he is too generous a fellow to marry for fortune  what do you  think  what do you say  lady delacour       i say  and think  and feel  as you do  my lord   said lady delacour      you say  and think  and feel the same as my lord   very extraordinary  indeed   said the dowager   then if it were not for the sake of the  fortune  pray why did mr  hervey marry at all  can any body guess       i should guess because he was in love   said lord delacour  for i  remember that was the reason i married myself       my dear good lord  but when i tell you the girl had been his mistress   till he was tired of her        my lady boucher   said mrs  margaret delacour  who had hitherto  listened in silence   my lady boucher  you have been misinformed  miss  hartley never was clarence hervey s mistress       i m mighty glad you think so  mrs  delacour  but i assure you nobody  else is so  charitable   those who live in the world hear a great deal  more than those who live out of the world  i can promise you  nobody  will visit the bride  and that is the thing by which we are to judge      then the dowager and the rest of the company continued to descant upon  the folly of the match  those who wished to pay their court to lady  delacour were the loudest in their astonishment at his throwing himself  away in this manner  her ladyship smiled  and kept them in play by her  address  on purpose to withdraw all eyes from miss portman  whilst   from time to time  she stole a glance at belinda  to observe how she was  affected by what passed  she was provoked by belinda s self possession   at last  when it had been settled that all the herveys were  odd   but  that this match of clarence s was the  oddest  of all the odd things  that any of the family had done for many generations  mrs  delacour  calmly said   are you sure  lady boucher  that mr  hervey is married       positive  as i said before  positive  madam  my woman had it from lady  newland s swiss  who had it from lady singleton s frenchwoman  who had  it from longueville  the hairdresser  who had it from lady almeria s own  woman  who was present at the ceremony  and must know if any body does       the report has come to us zigzag as quick as lightning  yet it does not  flash conviction upon me   said lady delacour      nor upon me   said mrs  delacour   for this simple reason  i have seen  miss hartley within these two hours  and i had it from herself that she  is not married       not married   cried the dowager with terror      i rather think not  she is now with her father  at my house at dinner   i believe  and clarence hervey is at lady almeria s  at windsor  her  ladyship is confined by a fit of the gout  and sent for her nephew  yesterday  if people who live out of the world hear less  they sometimes  hear more correctly than those who live in it       pray when does mr  hervey return from windsor   said the incorrigible  dowager      to morrow  madam   said mrs  delacour   as your ladyship is going to  several parties this evening  i think it but  charitable  to set you  right in these particulars  and i hope you will be so  charitable  as  to contradict the report of miss hartley s having been clarence s  mistress       why  as to that  if the young lady is not married  we must presume  there are good reasons for it   said the dowager   pray  on which side  was the match broken off       on neither side   answered mrs  delacour      the thing goes on then  and what day is the marriage to take place    said lady boucher      on monday  or tuesday  or wednesday  or thursday  or friday  or  saturday   or sunday  i believe   replied mrs  delacour  who had the  prudent art of giving answers effectually baffling to the curiosity of  gossips     the dowager consoled herself in her utmost need with a full plate of  brandy peaches  and spoke not a word more during the second course  when  the ladies retired after the dessert  she again commenced hostilities   she dared not come to open war with mrs  delacour  but in a bye battle   in a corner  she carried every thing before her  and she triumphantly  whispered   we shall see  ma am  that it will turn out  as i told you   that miss rachel  or virginia  or whatever he pleases to call her  has  been what i said  and  as i said  nobody will visit her  not a soul   fifty people i can count who have declared to me they ve made up their  minds  and my own s made up  i candidly confess  and lady delacour  i  am sure by her silence and looks  is of my way of thinking  and has no  opinion of the young lady  as to miss portman  she is  poor thing  of  course  so wrapped up in her own affairs  no wonder she says nothing   that was a sad business of mr  vincent s  i am surprised to see her look  even so well as she does after it  mr  percival  i am told   said the  well informed dowager  lowering her voice so much that the lovers of  scandal were obliged to close their heads round her   mr  percival  i am  informed  refused his consent to his ward  who is not of age  on account  of an anonymous letter  and it is supposed mr  vincent desired it for  an excuse to get off handsomely  fighting that duel about her with sir  philip baddely settled his love  so he is gone to germany  and she  is left to wear the willow  which  you see  becomes her as well as  everything else  did she eat any dinner  ma am  you sat next her       yes  more than i did  i am sure       very extraordinary  then perhaps sir philip baddely s  on  again  lord  bless me  what a match would that be for her  why  mrs  stanhope might  then  indeed  deserve to be called the match maker general  the seventh  of her nieces this  but look  there s mrs  delacour leading miss portman  off into the trictrac cabinet  with a face full of business  her hand  in hers  lord  i did not know they were on that footing  i wonder  what s going forward  suppose old hartley was to propose for miss  portman  there would be a denouement  and cut his daughter off with a  shilling  nothing s impossible  you know  did he ever see miss portman   i must go and find out  positively      in the mean time  mrs  delacour  unconscious of the curiosity she had  excited  was speaking to belinda in the trictrac cabinet      my dear miss portman   said she   you have a great deal of good nature   else i should not venture to apply to you on the present occasion  will  you oblige me  and serve a friend of mine  a gentleman who  as i once  imagined  was an admirer of yours       i will do any thing in my power to oblige any friend of yours  madam    said belinda   but of whom are you speaking       of mr  hervey  my dear young lady       tell me how i can serve him as a friend   said belinda  colouring  deeply      that you shall know immediately   said mrs  delacour  rummaging and  rustling for a considerable time amongst a heap of letters  which she  had pulled out of the largest pockets that ever woman wore  even in the  last century      oh  here it is   continued she  opening and looking into them   may i  trouble you just to look over this letter  it is from poor mr  hartley   he is  as you will see  excessively fond of his daughter  whom he has so  fortunately discovered after his long search  he is dreadfully nervous   and has been terribly annoyed by these idle gossiping stories  you find   by what lady boucher said at dinner  that they have settled it amongst  them that virginia is not a fit person to be visited  that she has been  clarence s mistress instead of his pupil  mr  hartley  you see by this  letter  is almost out of his senses with the apprehension that his  daughter s reputation is ruined  i sent my carriage to twickenham  the  moment i received this letter  for the poor girl and her gouvernante   they came to me this morning  but what can i do  i am only one old woman  against a confederacy of veteran gossips  but if i could gain you and  lady delacour for my allies  i should fear no adversaries  virginia is  to stay with me for some days  and lady delacour  i see  has a great  mind to come to see her  but she does not like to come without you  and  she says that she does not like to ask you to accompany her  i don t  understand her delicacy about the matter  i have none  believing  as i  do  that there is no foundation whatever for these malicious reports   which   entre nous   originated  i fancy  with mrs  marriott  now   will you oblige me  if you and lady delacour will come and see virginia  to morrow  all the world would follow your example the next day  it s  often cowardice that makes people ill natured  have you the courage   my good miss portman  to be the first to do a benevolent action  i  do assure you   continued mrs  delacour with great earnestness   i do  assure you i would as soon put my hand into that fire  this moment   as ask you to do any thing that i thought improper  but forgive me for  pressing this point  i am anxious to have your suffrage in her favour   miss belinda portman s character for prudence and propriety stands so  high  and is fixed so firmly  that she may venture to let us cling to  it  and i am as well convinced of the poor girl s innocence as i am of  yours  and when you see her  you will be of my opinion       i assure you  mrs  delacour   said belinda   that you have wasted a  great deal of eloquence upon this occasion  for        i am sorry for it   interrupted mrs  delacour  rising from her seat   with a look of some displeasure   i meant not to distress or offend you   miss portman  by  my eloquence   i am only concerned that i should have  so far mistaken your character as to expose myself to this refusal       i have given no refusal   said belinda  mildly   you did not let me  finish my sentence       i beg pardon  that is a foolish old trick of mine       mrs  delacour  i was going to say  has wasted a great deal of  eloquence  for i am entirely of her opinion  and i shall  with the  greatest readiness  comply with her request       you are a charming  generous girl  and i am a passionate old  fool  thank you a thousand times       you are not at all obliged to me   said belinda   when i first heard  this story  i believed it  as lady boucher now does  but i have had  reason to alter my opinion  and perhaps the same means of information  would have changed hers  once convinced  it is impossible to relapse  into suspicion       impossible to  you   the most truly virtuous women are always the least  suspicious and uncharitable in their opinion of their own sex  lady anne  percival inspired me with this belief  and miss portman confirms it   i admire your courage in daring to come forward in the defence of  innocence  i am very rude  alas  for praising you so much       i have not a right to your admiration   said belinda   for i must  honestly confess to you that i should not have this courage if there  were any danger in the case  i do not think that in doubtful cases it is  the business of a young woman to hazard her own reputation by an  attempt to preserve another s  i do not imagine  at least  that i am of  sufficient consequence in the world for this purpose  therefore i should  never attempt it  it is the duty of such women as mrs  delacour  whose  reputation is beyond the power of scandal  to come forward in the  defence of injured innocence  but this would not be courage in belinda  portman  it would be presumption and temerity       well  if you will not let me admire your courage  or your generosity   or your prudence   said mrs  delacour laughing   you must positively  let me admire  you  altogether  and love you too  for i cannot help it   farewell      after the company was gone  lady delacour was much surprised by the  earnestness with which belinda pressed the request that they might the  next morning pay a visit to virginia      my dear   said lady delacour   to tell you the truth  i am full of  curiosity  and excessively anxious to go  i hesitated merely on your  account  i fancied that you would not like the visit  and that if i went  without you  it might be taken notice of  but i am delighted to find  that you will come with me  i can only say that you have more generosity  than i should have in the same situation      the next morning they went together to mrs  delacour s  in their way  thither  belinda  to divert her own thoughts  and to rouse lady delacour  from the profound and unnatural silence into which she had fallen   petitioned her to finish the history of sir philip baddely  the dog   miss annabella luttridge  and her billet doux      for some of my high crimes and misdemeanours  you vowed that you would  not tell me the remainder of the story till the whole week had elapsed   now will you satisfy my curiosity  you recollect that you left off just  where you said that you were come to the best part of the story       was i  did i   very true  we shall have time enough to finish it  by and by  my dear   said lady delacour   at present my poor head is  running upon something else  and i have left off being an accomplished  actress  or i could talk of one subject and think of another as well  as the best of you   stop the carriage  my dear  i am afraid they have  forgot my orders       did you carry what i desired this morning to mrs  delacour   said her  ladyship to one of the footmen      i did  my lady       and did you say from me  that it was not to be opened till i came       yes  my lady       where did you leave it       in mrs  delacour s dressing room  my lady   she desired me to take it  up there  and she locked the door  and said no one should go in till you  came       very well  go on  belinda  my dear  i hope that i have worked up your  curiosity to the highest pitch            chapter xxxi     the denouement       curiosity was not  at this instant  the strongest passion in belinda s  mind  when the carriage stopped at mrs  delacour s door  her heart  almost ceased to beat  but she summoned resolution to go through  with  firmness and dignity  the task she had undertaken     clarence hervey was not in the room when they entered  nor was virginia   mrs  ormond said that she had been extremely feverish during the night   and that she had advised her not to get up till late in the day  but  mrs  delacour immediately went for her  and in a few minutes she made  her appearance     belinda and lady delacour exchanged a glance of surprise and admiration   there was a grace and simplicity in her manner  joined to an air of  naivete  that made an irresistible impression in her favour  lady  delacour  however  after the first surprise was over  seemed to relapse  into her former opinion  and the piercing looks which her ladyship from  time to time cast upon virginia as she spoke  produced their effect   she was abashed and silent  belinda endeavoured to engage her in  conversation  and to her she talked with ease and even with freedom   virginia examined miss portman s countenance with a species of  artless curiosity and interest  that was not restrained by factitious  politeness  this examination was not peculiarly agreeable to belinda   yet it was made with so much apparent simplicity  that she could not be  displeased     on the first pause in the conversation  mrs  delacour said   pray  my  dear lady delacour  what is this wonderful present that you sent to me  this morning  which you desired that no one should see till you came       i cannot satisfy your curiosity yet   replied lady delacour   i must  wait till clarence hervey comes  for the present is intended for him      an air of solemn mystery in her ladyship s manner  as she pronounced  these words  excited general attention  there was a dead silence  which  lasted several minutes  some feeble attempts were then made by each of  the company to start a fresh subject of conversation  but it would  not do  all relapsed into the silence of expectation  at last clarence  hervey arrived  belinda rejoiced that the universal curiosity which lady  delacour had inspired prevented any one s observing the sudden change in  mr  hervey s countenance when he beheld her      a pretty set of curious children you are   cried lady delacour   laughing   do you know  clarence  that they are all dying with  impatience to see  un gage d amitie  that i have brought for you  and  the reason that they are so curious is simply because i had the address  to say  in a solemn voice   i cannot satisfy your curiosity till  clarence hervey arrives   now follow me  my friends  and if you be  disappointed  lay the blame  not on me  but on your own imaginations      she led the way to mrs  delacour s dressing room  and all the company  followed      now  what do you expect to see   said she  putting the key into the  door     after waiting some moments for a reply  but in vain  she threw open  the door  and they saw  hung before the wall opposite to them  a green  curtain      i thought  my dear clarence   resumed lady delacour   that no present  could be more agreeable to you than a companion for your virginia  does  this figure   continued she  drawing back the curtain   does this figure  give you the idea of paul       paul   said clarence   it is a naval officer in full uniform  what can  your ladyship mean       virginia perhaps will know what i mean  if you will only stand out of  her way  and let her see the picture      at these words clarence made way for virginia  she turned her eyes upon  the picture  uttered a piercing shriek  and fell senseless upon the  floor      take it coolly   said lady delacour   and she will come to her senses  presently  young ladies must shriek and faint upon certain occasions   but men  looking at clarence hervey  need not always be dupes  this is  only a  scene   consider it as such  and admire the actress as i do       actress  oh  she is no actress   cried mrs  ormond     clarence hervey raised her from the ground  and belinda sprinkled water  over her face      she s dead   she s dead  oh  my sweet child  she s dead   exclaimed  mrs  ormond  trembling so violently  that she could not sustain  virginia      she is no actress  indeed   said clarence hervey   her pulse is gone      lady delacour looked at virginia s pale lips  touched her cold hands   and with a look of horror cried out   good heavens  what have i done   what shall we do with her       give her air  give her air  air  air   cried belinda      you keep the air from her  mrs  ormond   said mrs  delacour   let us  leave her to miss portman  she has more presence of mind than any of  us   and as she spoke she forced mrs  ormond away with her out of the  room      if mr  hartley should come  keep him with you  mrs  delacour   said  clarence hervey   is her pulse quite gone       no  it beats stronger and stronger   said belinda      her colour is returning   said lady delacour   there  raise her a  little  dear belinda  she is coming to herself       had not you better draw the curtain again before that picture   said  miss portman   lest she should see it the moment she opens her eyes      virginia came slowly to her recollection  saw lady delacour drawing the  curtain before the picture  then fixed her eyes upon clarence hervey   without uttering a word      are you better now   said he  in a gentle tone      oh  do not speak  do not look so kindly   cried virginia   i am  well  quite well  better than i deserve to be   and she pressed  belinda s hand  as if to thank her for assisting and supporting her      we may safely leave her now   whispered belinda to lady delacour   we  are strangers  and our presence only distresses her      they withdrew  but the moment virginia found herself alone with mr   hervey  she was seized with a universal tremor  she tried to speak  but  could not articulate  at last she burst into a flood of tears  and when  this had in some measure relieved her  she threw herself upon her knees   and clasping her hands  exclaimed  as she looked up to heaven       oh  if i knew what i ought to do   if i knew what i ought to say       shall i tell you  virginia  and will you believe me       yes  yes  yes       you ought to say  the truth  whatever it may be       but you will think me the most ungrateful of human beings       how often must i assure you  virginia  that i make no claim upon your  gratitude  speak to me  i conjure you  as you value your happiness and  mine  speak to me without disguise  what is all this mystery  why should  you fear to let me know what passes in your heart  why did you shriek at  the sight of that picture       oh  forgive me  forgive me   cried virginia  she would have sunk at his  feet  if he had not prevented her      i will  i can forgive any thing but deceit  do not look at me with so  much terror  virginia  i have not deserved it  my wish is to make you  happy  i would sacrifice even my own happiness to secure yours  but  do not mislead me  or you ruin us both  cannot you give me a distinct  answer to this simple question  why did you shriek at the sight of that  picture       because  but you will call me   perfidious  ungrateful  virginia     because i have seen that figure  he has knelt to me  he has  kissed my hand  and i           clarence hervey withdrew his arms  which had supported her  and placing  her upon a sofa  left her  whilst he walked up and down the room for  some minutes in silence      and why  virginia   said he  stopping short   was it necessary to  conceal all this from me  why was it necessary to persuade me that i  was beloved  why was it necessary that my happiness should be the  sacrifice       it shall not   it shall not  your happiness shall not be the sacrifice   heaven is my witness  that there is no sacrifice i would not make for  you  forgive me that shriek  i could not help fainting  indeed  but i  will be yours  i  ought  to be yours  and i am not perfidious  i am not  ungrateful  do not look upon me as you did in my dream       do not talk to me of dreams  my dear virginia  this is no time for  trifling  i ask no sacrifice from you  i ask nothing but truth       truth  mrs  ormond knows all the truth  i have concealed nothing from  her       but she has concealed every thing from me   cried clarence  and  with a  sudden impulse of indignation  he was going to summon her  but when his  hand was upon the lock of the door he paused  returned to virginia  and  said   let me hear the truth from  your  lips  it is all i shall ever  ask from you  how  when  where did you see this man       what man   said virginia  looking up  with the simple expression of  innocence in her countenance     clarence pointed to the picture      at the village in the new forest  at mrs  smith s house   said  virginia   one evening when i walked with her from my grandmother s  cottage       and your grandmother knew of this       yes   said virginia  blushing   and she was very much displeased       and mrs  ormond knew of this   pursued clarence      yes  but she told me that you would not be displeased at it      mr  hervey made another hasty step toward the door  but restraining  his impetuous temper  he again stopped  and leaning ever the back of a  chair  opposite to virginia  waited in silence for her to proceed  he  waited in vain      i do not mean to distress you  miss hartley   said he     she burst into tears   i knew  i knew   cried she   that you  would  be  displeased  i told mrs  ormond so  i knew you would never forgive me       in that you were mistaken   said clarence  mildly   i forgive you  without difficulty  as i hope you may forgive yourself  nor can it be my  wish to extort from you any mortifying confessions  but  perhaps  it may  yet be in my power to serve you  if you will trust to me  i will myself  speak to your father  i will do every thing to secure to you the object  of your affections  if you will  in this last moment of our connexion   treat me with sincerity  and suffer me to be your friend      virginia sobbed so violently for some time  that she could not speak   at last she said   you are  you are the most generous of men  you have  always been my  best  friend  i am the most ungrateful of human beings   but i am sure i never wished  i never intended  to deceive you  mrs   ormond told me        do not speak of her at present  or perhaps i may lose my temper    interrupted clarence in an altered voice   only tell me  i conjure you   tell me  in one word  who is this man and where is he to be found       i do not know  i do not understand you   said virginia      you do not know  you will not trust me  then i must leave you to  to  mr  hartley       do not leave me  oh  do not leave me in anger   cried virginia   clinging to him   not trust you   i   not trust you  oh  what  can  you  mean  i have no confessions to make  mrs  ormond knows every thought of  my mind  and so shall you  if you will only hear me  i do not know who  this man is  i assure you  nor where he is to be found       and yet you love him  can you love a man whom you do not know   virginia       i only love his figure  i believe   said virginia      his figure       indeed i am quite bewildered   said virginia  looking round wildly   i  know not what i feel       if you permitted this man to kneel to you  to kiss your hand  surely  you must know that you love him  virginia       but that was only in a dream  and mrs  ormond said          only a dream  but you met him at mrs  smith s  in the new forest       that was only a picture       only a picture   but you have seen the original       never  never in my life  and i wish to heaven i had never  never seen  the fatal picture  the image haunts me day and night  when i read of  heroes in the day  that figure rises to my view  instead of yours  when  i go to sleep at night  i see it  instead of yours  in my dreams  it  speaks to me  it kneels to me  i long ago told mrs  ormond this  but she  laughed at me  i told her of that frightful dream  i saw you weltering  in your blood  i tried to save you  but could not  i heard you say    perfidious  ungrateful virginia  you are the cause of my death   oh   it was the most dreadful night i ever passed  still this figure  this  picture  was before me  and he was the knight of the white plumes  and  it was he who stabbed you  but when i wished him to be victorious  i did  not know that he was fighting against you  so mrs  ormond told me that  i need not blame myself  and she said that you were not so foolish as to  be jealous of a picture  but i knew you would be displeased  i knew you  would think me ungrateful  i knew you would never forgive me      whilst virginia rapidly uttered all this  clarence marked the wild  animation of her eyes  the sudden changes of her countenance  he  recollected her father s insanity  every feeling of his mind gave way to  terror and pity  he approached her with all the calmness that he  could assume  took both her hands  and holding them in his  said  in a  soothing voice       my dear virginia  you are not ungrateful  i do not think you so  i am  not displeased with you  you have done nothing to displease me  compose  yourself  dear virginia       i am quite composed  now you again call me dear virginia  only i am  afraid  as i always told mrs  ormond  that i do not love you  enough    but she said that i did  and that my fear was the strongest proof of my  affection      virginia now spoke in so consistent a manner that clarence could not  doubt that she was in the clear possession of her understanding  she  repeated to him all that she had said to mrs  ormond  and he began to  hope that  without any intention to deceive  mrs  ormond s ignorance  of the human heart led her into a belief that virginia was in love with  him  whilst  in fact  her imagination  exalted by solitude and romance   embodied and became enamoured of a phantom      i always told mrs  ormond that she was mistaken   said clarence    i never believed that you loved me  virginia  till   he paused and  carefully examined her countenance   till you yourself gave me reason to  think so  was it only a principle of gratitude  then  that dictated your  answer to my letter      she looked irresolute  and at last  in a low voice  said   if i could  see  if i could speak to mrs  ormond            she cannot tell what are the secret feelings of your heart  virginia   consult no mrs  ormond  consult no human creature but yourself       but mrs  ormond told me that you loved me  and that you had educated me  to be your wife      mr  hervey made an involuntary exclamation against mrs  ormond s folly      how  then  can you be happy   continued virginia   if i am so  ungrateful as to say i do not love you  that i do not  love  you   oh    that  i cannot say  for i do love you better than any one living except  my father  and with the same sort of affection that i feel for him   you ask me to tell you the secret feelings of my heart  the only secret  feeling of which i am conscious is  a wish not to marry  unless i could  see in reality such a person as    but that i knew was only a picture   a dream  and i thought that i ought at least to sacrifice my foolish  imaginations to you  who have done so much for me  i knew that it would  be the height of ingratitude to refuse you  and besides  my father  told me that you would not accept of my fortune without my hand  so  i consented to marry you  forgive me  if these were wrong motives  i  thought them right  only tell me what i can do to make you happy  as  i am sure i wish to do  to that wish i would sacrifice every other  feeling       sacrifice nothing  dear virginia  we may both be happy without making  any sacrifice of our feelings   cried clarence  and  transported at  regaining his own freedom  virginia s simplicity never appeared to  him so charming as at this moment   dearest virginia  forgive me for  suspecting you for one instant of any thing unhandsome  mrs  ormond   with the very best intentions possible  has led us both to the brink  of misery  but i find you such as i always thought you  ingenuous   affectionate  innocent       and you are not angry with me   interrupted virginia  with joyful  eagerness   and you will not think me ungrateful  and you will not be  unhappy  and mrs  ormond was mistaken  and you do not wish that i should   love  you  that i should be your wife  i mean  oh  don t deceive me   for i cannot help believing whatever you say      clarence hervey  to give her a convincing proof that mrs  ormond had  misled her as to his sentiments  immediately avowed his passion for  belinda      you have relieved me from all doubt  all fear  all anxiety   said  virginia  with the sweetest expression of innocent affection in her  countenance   may you be as happy as you deserve to be  may belinda  is  not that her name   may belinda       at this moment lady delacour half opened the door  exclaiming   human  patience can wait no longer       will you trust me to explain for you  dear virginia   said clarence      most willingly   said virginia  retiring as lady delacour advanced    pray leave me here alone  whilst you  who are used to talk before  strangers  speak for me       dare you venture  clarence   said her ladyship  as she closed the door    to leave her alone with that picture  you are no lover  if you be not  jealous       i am not jealous   said clarence   yet i am a lover  a passionate  lover       a passionate lover   cried lady delacour  stopping short as they were  crossing the antechamber    then i have done nothing but mischief  in  love with virginia  i will not  cannot believe it       in love with belinda   cannot you  will not you believe it       my dear clarence  i never doubted it for an instant  but are you at  liberty to own it to any body but me       i am at liberty to declare it to all the world       you transport me with joy  i will not keep you from her a second  but  stay  i am sorry to tell you  that  as she informed me this morning    her heart is not at present inclined to love   and here is mrs   margaret delacour  poor wretch  in this room  dying with curiosity   curiosity is as ardent as love  and has as good a claim to compassion      as he entered the room  where there were only mrs  margaret delacour and  belinda  clarence hervey s first glance  rapid as it was  explained his  heart     belinda put her arm within lady delacour s  trembling so that she  could scarcely stand  lady delacour pressed her hand  and was perfectly  silent      and what is miss portman to believe   cried mrs  margaret delacour    when she has seen you on the very eve of marriage with another lady       the strongest merit i can plead with such a woman as miss portman is   that i was ready to sacrifice my own happiness to a sense of duty  now  that i am at liberty          now that you are at liberty   interrupted lady delacour   you are in a  vast hurry to offer your whole soul to a lady  who has for months  seen all your merits with perfect insensibility  and who has been   notwithstanding all my operations  stone blind to your love       the struggles of my passion cannot totally have escaped belinda s  penetration   said clarence   but i like her a thousand times the better  for not having trusted merely to appearances  that love is most to be  valued which cannot be easily won  in my opinion there is a prodigious  difference between a warm imagination and a warm heart       well   said lady delacour   we have all of us seen  pamela  maritata   let us now see  belinda in love   if that be possible   if    forgive me this last stroke  my dear  in spite of all my raillery  i  do believe that the prudent belinda is more capable of feeling real  permanent passion than any of the dear sentimental young ladies  whose  motto is        all for love  or the world well lost        that is just my opinion   said mrs  margaret delacour      but pray  what is become of mr  hartley   looking round   i do not see  him       no  for i have hid him   said lady delacour   he shall be forthcoming  presently       dear mr  clarence hervey  what have you done with my virginia   said  mrs  ormond  coming into the room      dear mrs  ormond  what have  you  done with her   replied clarence   by  your mistaken kindness  by insisting upon doing us both good against our  wills  you were very near making us both miserable for life  but i blame  nobody  i have no right to blame any one so much as myself  all this  has arisen from my own presumption and imprudence  nothing could be more  absurd than my scheme of educating a woman in solitude to make her fit  for society  i might have foreseen what must happen  that virginia would  consider me as her tutor  her father  not as her lover  or her husband   that with the most affectionate of hearts  she could for me feel nothing  but  gratitude        nothing but gratitude   repeated mrs  ormond  with a degree of  amazement in her countenance  which made every body present smile   i am  sure i thought she was dying for love of you       my dear belinda   whispered lady delacour   if i might judge of the  colour of this cheek  which has been for some moments permanent crimson   i should guess that you were beginning to find out  of what use the sun  is to the dial        you will not let me hear what mr  hervey is saying   replied belinda    i am very curious       curiosity is a stronger passion than love  as i told him just now    said lady delacour     in spite of all his explanations  mrs  ormond could not be made to  comprehend virginia s feelings  she continually repeated   but it is  impossible for virginia  or for any body  to be in love with a picture       it is not said that she is in love with a picture   replied mrs   delacour   though even for that i could find you a precedent       my lady delacour   said mrs  ormond   will you explain to us how that  picture came into your possession  and how it came here  and  in short   all that is to be known about it       ay  explain  explain  my dear lady delacour   cried mrs  delacour    i am afraid i am grown almost as curious as my lady boucher  explain   explain       most willingly   said lady delacour   to marriott s ruling passion for  birds you are all of you indebted for this discovery  some time ago   whilst we were at twickenham  as marriott was waiting at a stationer s   to bid her last adieus to a bullfinch  a gentleman came into the shop  where she and bobby  as she calls this bird  were coquetting  and the  gentleman was struck even more than marriott with the bullfinch  he went  almost distracted on hearing a particular tune  which this bird sang  i  suspected  from the symptoms  that the gentleman must be  or must have  been  in love with the bullfinch s mistress  now the bullfinch was  traced home to the ci devant virginia st  pierre  the present miss  hartley  i had my reasons for being curious about her loves and lovers   and as soon as i learned the story from marriott  i determined  if  possible  to find out who this stranger  with the strange passion for  bullfinches  might be  i questioned and cross questioned all those  people at the stationer s who were present when he fell into ecstasies   and  from the shopman  who had been bribed to secrecy  i learned that  our gentleman returned to the stationer s the day after he met marriott   and watched till he obtained a sight of virginia  as she came to her  window  now it was believed by the girl of this shop  who had lived for  some time with mrs  ormond  forgive me  mr  hervey  for what i am going  to say  forgive me  mrs  ormond  scandal  like death  is common to  all  it was believed that virginia was mr  hervey s mistress  my  stranger no sooner learned this than he swore that he would think of her  no more  and after bestowing a variety of seamen s  execrations upon  the villain who had seduced this heavenly creature  he departed from  twickenham  and was no more seen or heard of  my inquiries after him  were indefatigable  but for some time unsuccessful  and so they might  have continued  and we might have been all making one another unhappy at  this moment  if it had not been for mr  vincent s great dog juba  miss  annabella luttridge s billet doux  sir philip baddely s insolence  my  lord delacour s belief in a quack balsam  and captain sunderland s  humanity       captain sunderland  who is captain sunderland  we never heard of him  before   cried mrs  ormond      you shall hear of him just as i did  if you please   said lady  delacour   and if belinda will submit to hear me tell the same story  twice      here her ladyship repeated the history of the battle of the dogs  and  of sir philip baddely s knocking down juba  the man  for struggling in  defence of juba  the dog      now the gentleman who assisted my lord delacour in bringing the  disabled negro across the square to our house  was captain sunderland   my lord summoned marriott to produce lady boucher s infallible balsam   that it might be tried upon juba s sprained ankle  whilst my lord was  intent upon the balsam  marriott was intent upon captain sunderland   she recollected that she had met him somewhere before  and the moment he  spoke  she knew him to be the gentleman who had fallen into ecstasies  in the shop at twickenham  about the bullfinch  marriott hastened to  me with the news  i hastened to my lord  made him introduce captain  sunderland to me  and i never rested till he had told me all that i  wanted to know  some years ago  just before he went to sea  he paid  a visit to his mother  who then lodged with a widow smith  in the new  forest  whilst he was there  he heard of the young beauty who lived in  the forest  with a grandmother  who was  not a little particular   and  who would not permit any body to see her      my captain s curiosity was excited  one day  unseen by the duenna  he  obtained a distinct view of virginia  watering her roses and tending her  bees  struck with her uncommon beauty  he approached carefully to the  thicket in which the cottage was enclosed  and found a  lair   where  he concealed himself  day after day  and contemplated at leisure the  budding charms of the fair wood nymph  in short  he became so enamoured   that he was determined to gain admittance at the cottage  and declare  his passion  but to his honour be it told  that when the history of the  poor girl s mother  and the situation and fears of the old lady  who  was her only friend  were known to him  in consideration of the extreme  youth of the ward  and the extreme age of her guardian  he determined to  defer his addresses till his return from the west indies  whither he was  shortly to sail  and where he had hopes of making a fortune  that  might put him in a situation to render the object of his affections  independent  he left a bullfinch with mrs  smith  who gave it to  virginia  without telling to whom it had belonged  lest her grandmother  might be displeased      i really thought that all this showed too nice a moral sense for  a young dashing lieutenant in the navy  and i was persuaded that my  gentleman was only keeping his mistress s secret like a man of honour   with this belief  i regretted that clarence hervey should throw himself  away upon a girl who was unworthy of him       i hope   interrupted clarence   you are perfectly convinced of your  mistake       perfectly  perfectly   i am convinced that virginia is only half mad   but let me go on with my story  i was determined to discover whether she  had any remains of affection for this captain  it was in vain he assured  me that she had never seen him  i prevailed upon him to let me go on my  own way  i inquired whether he had ever had his picture drawn  yes  he  had for his mother  just when he first went out to sea  it had been left  at the widow smith s  i begged him to procure it for me  he told me it  was impossible  i told him i trampled on impossibilities  in short  he  got the picture for me  as you see   now   thought i   if he speaks the  truth  virginia will see this picture without emotion  and it will only  seem to be a present for clarence  but if she had ever seen him before   or had any secret to conceal  she will betray herself on the sudden  appearance of this picture   things have turned out contrary to all my  expectations  and yet better       and now  clarence  i must beg you  will prevail on miss hartley to appear  i can go on no farther without  her      lady delacour took virginia by the hand  the moment she entered the  room      will you trust yourself with me  miss hartley   said she   i have made  you faint once to day by the sight of a picture  will you promise me not  to faint again  when i produce the original       the original   said virginia   i will trust myself with you  for i am  sure you cannot mean to laugh at me  though  perhaps  i deserve to be  laughed at      lady delacour threw open the door of another apartment  mr  hartley  appeared  and with him captain sunderland      my dear daughter   said mr  hartley   give me leave to introduce to you  a friend  to whom i owe more obligations than to any man living  except  to mr  hervey  this gentleman was stationed some years ago at jamaica   and in a rebellion of the negroes on my plantation he saved my life   fortune has accidentally thrown my benefactor in my way  to show my  sense of my obligations is out of my power      virginia s surprise was extreme  her vivid dreams  the fond wishes of  her waking fancy  were at once accomplished  for the first moment she  gazed as on an animated picture  and all the ideas of love and romance  associated with this image rushed upon her mind     but when the realities by which he was surrounded dispelled the  illusion  she suddenly withdrew her eyes  and blushed deeply  with such  timid and graceful modesty as charmed every body present     captain sunderland pressed forward  but was stopped by lady delacour      avaunt  thou real lover   cried she   none but the shadow of a man can  hope to approach the visionary maid  in vain has marraton forced his way  through the bushes and briars  in vain has he braved the apparition of  the lion  there is yet a phantom barrier apparently impassable between  him and his yaratilda  for he is in the world of shadows  now  mark me   marraton  hurry not this delicate spirit  or perchance you frighten and  lose her for ever  but have patience  and gradually and gracefully she  will venture into your world of realities  only give her time       time  o yes  give me time   cried virginia  shrinking back      my dear miss hartley   continued lady delacour   in plain prose  to  prevent all difficulties and embarrassments  i must inform you  that  captain sunderland will not insist upon prompt payment of your father s  debt of gratitude  he has but one quarter of an hour to spend with  us  he is actually under sailing orders  so that you will have time to  compose your mind before his return  clarence  i advise you to accompany  captain sunderland on this cruise  don t you  belinda      and now  my good friends   continued lady delacour   shall i finish the  novel for you       if your ladyship pleases  nobody can do it better   said clarence  hervey      but i hope you will remember  dear lady delacour   said belinda   that  there is nothing in which novelists are so apt to err as in hurrying  things toward the conclusion  in not allowing  time  enough for that  change of feeling  which change of situation cannot instantly produce       that s right  my dear belinda  true to your principles to the last  gasp  fear nothing  you shall have  time  enough to become accustomed  to clarence  would you choose that i should draw out the story to five  volumes more  with your advice and assistance  i can with the greatest  ease  my dear  a declaration of love  you know  is only the beginning  of things  there may be blushes  and sighs  and doubts  and fears  and  misunderstandings  and jealousies without end or common sense  to fill  up the necessary space  and to gain the necessary  time   but if i might  conclude the business in two lines  i should say          ye gods  annihilate both space and time       and make four lovers happy        oh  that would be cutting matters too short   said mrs  margaret  delacour   i am of the old school  and though i could dispense with the  description of miss harriot byron s worked chairs and fine china  yet i  own i like to hear something of the preparation for a marriage  as well  as of the mere wedding  i like to hear  how  people become happy in a  rational manner  better than to be told in the huddled style of an old  fairy tale   and so they were all married  and they lived very happily  all the rest of their days        we are not in much danger of hearing such an account of modern  marriages   said lady delacour   but how shall i please you all   some  people cry   tell me every thing   others say  that          le secret d ennuyer est celui de tout dire        something must be left to the imagination  positively i will not  describe wedding dresses  or a procession to church  i have no objection  to saying that the happy couples were united by the worthy mr  moreton   that mr  percival gave belinda away  and that immediately after the  ceremony  he took the whole party down with him to oakly park  will this  do   or  we may conclude  if you like it better  with a characteristic  letter of congratulation from mrs  stanhope to her  dearest  niece   belinda  acknowledging that she was wrong to quarrel with her for  refusing sir philip baddely  and giving her infinite credit for that  admirable  management  of clarence hervey  which she hopes will continue  through life       well  i have no objection to ending with a letter   said mrs  delacour    for last speeches are always tiresome       yes   said her ladyship   it is so difficult  as the critic says  to  get lovers off upon their knees  now i think of it  let me place you all  in proper attitudes for stage effect  what signifies being happy   unless we appear so   captain sunderland  kneeling with virginia  if you  please  sir  at her father s feet  you in the act of giving them your  blessing  mr  hartley  mrs  ormond clasps her hands with joy  nothing  can be better than that  madam  i give you infinite credit for the  attitude  clarence  you have a right to belinda s hand  and may kiss  it too  nay  miss portman  it is the rule of the stage  now  where s  my lord delacour  he should be embracing me  to show that we are  reconciled  ha  here he comes  enter lord delacour  with little helena  in his hand  very well  a good start of surprise  my love  stand still   pray  you cannot be better than you are  helena  my love  do not let go  your father s hand  there  quite pretty and natural  now  lady delacour   to show that she is reformed  comes forward to address the audience with  a moral  a moral  yes

carefully     here s a letter for me   said sandy chipmunk    farmer green s cat leaped out of the doorway          the tale of sandy chipmunk          i    sandy s name      in the first place  no doubt you will want to learn why he was known as   sandy   many others  before you  have wondered how sandy chipmunk came  by his name     whenever any one asked sandy himself why he was so called  he always said  that he was in too great a hurry to stop to explain  and it is a fact  that of all the four footed folk in pleasant valley  and on blue mountain  as well  he was one of the busiest  he was a great worker  and when he  played  as he sometimes did  he played just as hard as he worked     in spite of his being so busy  there may have been another reason why he  never would tell any one why he was named sandy  jimmy rabbit was the  first to suggest that perhaps sandy chipmunk didn t know     jimmy and some of his neighbors were sunning themselves in farmer green s  pasture one day  and while they were idling away the afternoon sandy  chipmunk scurried past on top of the stone wall  with his cheek pouches  full of nuts      there goes sandy chipmunk   jimmy rabbit exclaimed  he called to sandy   but sandy did not stop  he made no answer  either  beyond a flick of his  tail  you see  his mouth was so full that he couldn t say a word      i was going to ask him about his name   jimmy rabbit remarked   i ve  almost made up my mind that he doesn t know any more about it than  anybody else       probably he doesn t   fatty coon agreed   but it s easy to see why he s  called sandy  he likes to dig in the  sandy  soil in this pasture       i don t agree with you   billy woodchuck said    i  think he was named  sandy on account of his yellowish  reddish  brownish color      some of the others thought that billy might have guessed the right  answer  but frisky squirrel told them that that wasn t the reason at all      it s because he s  plucky    he declared   you know   gritty  is the  same as  plucky   and  sandy  is the same as  gritty   that s the  reason   frisky said   it s plain as the nose on your face   he was  looking straight at tommy fox as he said that     now  tommy fox had a very long nose  and he became angry at once  his  face would have grown red  probably  if it hadn t been that color always      you don t know what you re talking about   he snapped     old mr  crow  who sat in a tree nearby  nodded his head      you re all wrong   he told them   the reason for calling that young  chipmunk boy sandy is because his real name is alexander  and everybody  who knows anything at all knows that sandy is just a short way of saying  alexander      when they heard that  fatty coon and billy woodchuck and frisky squirrel  looked foolish  people thought mr  crow was a wise old gentleman  and  when he said a thing was so  that usually settled it      here he comes again   mr  crow said     they all looked around  and sure enough  there was sandy chipmunk   hurrying along the top of the wall  to get more nuts to store away for  the winter      wait a moment   mr  crow called to him   i want to tell you something      sandy chipmunk came to a halt and sat up on top of a stone  with his tail  curled over his back      talk fast  please   he said   i m in a great hurry  winter will be here  before you know it  and i want to store away a great many nuts before  somebody else gathers them all       i won t keep you long   mr  crow told him   it s about your name        i ve no time to stop to explain   sandy chipmunk interrupted   as i  said  i m very busy to day   and he started to scamper along the wall  again     once more mr  crow stopped him      you don t understand   he said   i don t want to  ask  you anything  i  want to  tell  you something       oh   said sandy   that s different  what is it       it s quite a joke   mr  crow said  and he laughed loudly   these young  fellows here have been trying to tell one another why you re called  sandy  one of  em says it s because you like to dig in the sandy soil   and another says it s because of your color  and still another claims  it s because you re plucky  but i tell  em it s because your real name is  alexander  and of course i m right   said old mr  crow     sandy chipmunk smiled  and then he started off again  and again mr  crow  stopped him      quite a joke on these youngsters  isn t it   he inquired      you told me you didn t want to  ask  me anything   sandy chipmunk  reminded him   but i will say this  though i am in a great hurry  so far  as i know  you are all of you right  and that s a joke on you  mr  crow      then sandy chipmunk scampered off  and everybody laughed  except mr   crow      alexander chipmunk is a very pert young man   he grumbled           ii    something in the sky      when sandy chipmunk was just a little chap his mother began to teach him  to take care of himself  she told him that among other enemies he must  always watch out for foxes and minks and weasels  especially weasels      they are very dangerous   mrs  chipmunk said      well  i ll always be safe if i climb a tree  won t i   sandy asked her      goodness  no   his mother replied   there are many big birds  such as  hawks and owls and eagles  that would catch you if they could     but  i ll tell you about  them  some other time  sandy      well  sandy chipmunk went out to play  but he didn t have what you would  call a good time  because he couldn t help thinking of his mother s  warning  he kept looking all around to see whether a weasel or a mink or  a fox might be trying to steal up behind him  and he kept looking up to  make sure that no big bird was ready to swoop down upon him     but nothing of the sort happened  at least  not until the middle of the  afternoon  sandy had begun to believe that his mother was too timid  he  did not think there was anything in farmer green s pasture to be afraid  of  there were the cows  nothing seemed to worry  them   they ate grass   or chewed their cuds  and never once looked behind them     sandy chipmunk wandered further and further from home  for a long time he  had not taken the trouble to look at the sky  but at last he glanced up   and to his great alarm he saw  hovering in the air far above him  an  enormous creature  he had never seen its like before  it seemed all head  and tail  two great eyes stared at sandy chipmunk and sent a chill of  fear over him  the monster s wide mouth grinned at him cruelly  and its  long tail lashed back and forth as if its owner were very angry  even as  sandy looked at the creature it gave a horrid scream     sandy chipmunk did not wait for anything else  he turned and ran home   and a few of his friends who happened to see him remarked that he seemed  to be in a greater hurry than ever     sandy felt better when he found himself safe in his mother s house  and  he told mrs  chipmunk what he had seen      it may be an owl   he said   because it has big  round eyes  but its  tail was not like any owl s tail that i ever saw  it was like six  catamounts  tails  all tied in knots       that s queer   his mother remarked   i never knew of a bird with a tail  like that       maybe it s a beast that has learned to fly   sandy suggested      beasts can t fly   mrs  chipmunk said     but sandy knew better than that      there s the flying squirrel family   he reminded her      they can only fly from one tree to another   his mother told him   i  think i ll peep out and see for myself what this strange creature looks  like      he begged her not to  but mrs  chipmunk said she would be careful  and  she went out and looked up at the sky     sandy was surprised when she came back laughing      what is it  mother   he asked   is it a bird or a beast       neither   mrs  chipmunk answered with a smile      then it must be a fish   sandy exclaimed      no  it s not a fish  either   his mother said   it s nothing but a kite  that johnnie green has made  he has painted eyes and a mouth on it  and i  must say that if i didn t know a kite when i saw one it might have  frightened me       but what makes it lash its tail that way   sandy asked her      the wind is blowing it   mrs  chipmunk explained      what made it scream   sandy inquired      it didn t   his mother replied      illustration  mrs  chipmunk went to the door with sandy     now  sandy chipmunk knew better than to contradict his mother  so all he  said was this      let s go outside and listen      still smiling  mrs  chipmunk went to the door again with sandy  and  pretty soon they heard a long  far off wail      there   he cried   that s it  don t you hear it  mother       that    mrs  chipmunk said   that is nothing but the whistle of an  engine  way down at the other end of pleasant valley            iii    the broken egg      nuts and grains were what sandy chipmunk ate more than anything else  but  sometimes when he could not find enough of those  or when he wanted a  change of food  he would eat almost any sort of berry  and apples and  pears as well  tomatoes  too  he liked once in a while  and he was very  fond of sunflower seeds  he would not refuse a fat insect  either  if it  flew his way  but these were not the only dainties that sandy thought  good  there was something else  something to be found in trees  for which  sandy sometimes hunted  and before he came home  after finding what he  was looking for  he always wiped his mouth with great care     if you had ever seen him wiping his mouth like that  you might have  guessed that sandy chipmunk had been eating birds  eggs  and the reason  he was so careful to remove all signs of his feast was because he did not  want his mother to know what he had been doing     now you have heard the worst there is to know about sandy chipmunk     to you it may seem odd that mrs  chipmunk did not think it wrong to rob  birds  nests  and now you know the worst about  her      sandy s mother liked eggs just as much as he did  but her son was such  a little fellow that she was afraid he might get hurt climbing trees  and looking for eggs  she told him that some day some bird might  surprise him when he was enjoying a meal of her eggs  and peck out one  or two of his eyes      keep away from the nests   mrs  chipmunk said     but sandy had had too many tastes of birds  eggs  he simply couldn t  resist eating a few eggs now and then  of course  when he did that he  disobeyed his mother  and of course  if she had known it she would have  punished him     as the spring days sped past  the birds that lived in farmer green s  pasture grew very angry with sandy chipmunk  you see  it was not  long before they discovered who it was that was robbing their nests  now and then      you d better leave birds  eggs alone   mr  crow warned him one day   a  number of my friends have told me what they re going to do to you  if  they catch you near their nests      but sandy told mr  crow to keep his advice to himself      what about farmer green s corn   sandy asked the old gentleman   i ve  heard that farmer green is looking for you with a gun      mr  crow didn t even answer him  he just flew away  there were some  things he didn t like to talk about     that very afternoon sandy chipmunk spied a robin s nest in a tree not far  from where he lived  and in less time than it takes to tell it  he had  climbed the tree and run out on the limb where the nest rested     sandy chipmunk smiled as he peered into the robin s nest  the four  greenish blue eggs that he saw there looked very good to him  and he  smacked his lips  though his mother had often told him not to  he was  just picking the eggs out of the nest when he heard a rustle in the  leaves over his head  and sandy chipmunk looked up quickly     it seemed to him  at first  that the air was full of monstrous birds   actually  there were only three of them  mr  and mrs  robin and a  neighbor of theirs  but to sandy they looked six times as big as they  really were   that  was because they had caught him robbing the nest     he was so startled that he dropped the eggs  they fell back into the  nest  all except one  which broke upon the ground beneath the tree      robber   mrs  robin screamed      thief   mr  robin roared      villain   their neighbor cried     it is a wonder they didn t fly straight at sandy and knock him off the  limb     at first he was too frightened to say a word  but when he saw that he  wasn t hurt  sandy looked down at the broken egg and said      what a pity   he meant it  too  for he thought it was a shame to waste a  perfectly good egg like that  when he might have eaten it      you don t mean you re sorry  do you   mrs  robin asked him      certainly i am   sandy told her   i was just counting your eggs  and  when you startled me  i dropped that one  i thought it must be a hawk   you all made such a noise       you re sure you weren t going to eat our eggs   mr  robin inquired      eat them   sandy exclaimed   why  my mother has often told me not to eat  birds  eggs      when he heard that  mr  robin whispered something to his wife  and then  he said to sandy chipmunk      you go home  and don t let me catch you around this tree again      sandy was glad to escape so easily as that  and though he was sorry to  have missed a good meal  there was one thing that made him almost  happy  he didn t have to bother to wipe his mouth before he let his  mother see him           iv    building a house      there came a day when sandy chipmunk decided that he was old enough and  big enough to make a house of his own  he was not the sort of person to  think and think about a thing and put off the doing of it from one day to  another  so the moment the idea of a house popped into his head sandy  chipmunk began hunting for a good place to dig     it was not long before he found a bit of ground that seemed to him the  very best spot for a home that any one could want     the place where he intended to make his front door was in the middle of a  smooth plot among some beech trees  farmer green s cows had clipped the  grass short all around  and sandy knew that he could have a neat dooryard  without being obliged to go to the trouble of cutting the grass himself   but what he liked most of all about the place was that as he stood there  he could look all around in every direction  that was just what he  wanted  because whenever he wished to leave his new house he would be  able to peep out and see whether anybody was waiting to catch him     so sandy chipmunk took off his little  short coat  folded it carefully   and laid it down upon the grass  then he pulled off his necktie and  unbuttoned his collar  just because he was going to dig in the ground  there was no reason why he should get his clothes dirty     after that sandy chipmunk set to work  and you should have seen how he  made the earth fly  when night came and he had to stop working there was  a big heap of dirt beneath the beech trees  to show how busy sandy had  been  there was a big hole in the pasture  too  but it was nothing at  all  compared with the hole sandy had dug by the time he had finished  his house     every morning sandy chipmunk came back to the grove of beech trees to  work upon his new house  and it was not many days before his burrow was  so deep that when winter came the ground about his chamber would not  freeze  it was what farmer green would have called  below frost line      you must not think it was an easy matter for sandy chipmunk to dig a  home  you must remember that somehow he had to bring the dirt out of his  tunnel to the top of the ground  and he did that by  pushing it ahead of  him with his nose      you may laugh when you hear that  but for sandy chipmunk it was no  laughing matter  if  he  had laughed  just as likely as not he would have  found his mouth full of dirt  and you can understand that that wouldn t  have been very pleasant     as it was  his face was very dirty  but he never went back to his  mother s house until he had washed it carefully  just as a cat washes her  face     sometimes sandy found stones in his way  down there beneath the pasture   and those he had to push up  too  sometimes a stone was too big to crowd  through the opening into the world outside  and then sandy had to make  the opening bigger  after he had done that  and pushed the stone out upon  his dirt pile  he would make his doorway smaller again by packing earth  firmly into it     you must not suppose that when sandy brought the loose dirt and stones up  through his doorway he left them there  not at all  he pushed all the  litter some distance away  and whenever he turned  to scamper down into  his burrow again  he would kick behind him  as hard as he could  to  scatter the dirt still further from his new house     after sandy had made himself a chamber where he could sleep  and where he  could store enough food to last him throughout the winter  any one would  naturally imagine that his house was finished  but sandy chipmunk was not  yet satisfied with his new home  there was still something else that he  wanted to do to it           v    mrs  chipmunk is glad      after sandy chipmunk had dug his chamber underneath farmer green s  pasture  he liked the  inside  of his house quite well  but the looks of  the  outside  did not please him at all  he wanted a neat dooryard  and  how could he have that  with that yawning hole through which he had  pushed earth and stones  which still littered the grass a little  distance away     luckily  sandy knew exactly what to do  so he set to work to close the  big work hole  it was no easy task  as you can believe  but at last he  managed to pack the hole full of dirt     then he had no door at all  and there he was in the dark  inside the  hall that led to his chamber and storeroom  but that did not worry sandy   you see  he knew just what he was about  and before long he had dug a new  doorway  a small  neat  round hole  which you would probably have walked  right past  without noticing it  it was so hard to see in the grass that  grew thickly about it     you might think that at last sandy s house was finished  but he was not  satisfied with it until he had made still another doorway  in the same  fashion  he knew that it was safer to have an extra door through which he  could slip out when some enemy was entering by the other one  then sandy  chipmunk s house was finished  and he was greatly pleased with it     but his work was not yet done  he had to furnish his chamber  so he began  to hunt about for dry leaves  to make him a bed  these he stuffed into  his cheek pouches and carried into his house  but he didn t march proudly  up to one of his two doors  oh  no  he reached it by careful leaps and  bounds  and when he left home again he was particular to go in the same  manner in which he had come     it made no difference which of his doors sandy used  he always came and  went like that  because he didn t want to wear a path to either of his  two doors or tramp down the grass around them  if he had been so careless  as to let people notice where he lived he would have been almost sure to  have enemies prowling about his house  and if a weasel had happened to  see one of sandy s neat doorways he would have pushed right in  in the  hope of finding sandy inside his house     in that case the weasel would probably have pushed out again  with sandy  inside  him   so you can understand that sandy chipmunk had the best of  reasons for being careful     after he had made a soft  warm bed for himself  sandy set to work to  gather nuts and grain  to store in his house and eat during the winter   he was particular to choose only well cured  or dried  food  for he knew  that that was the only sort that would keep through the long winter  down  in his underground storeroom     he gathered other food  too  besides nuts and grain  near farmer green s  house he found some plump sunflower seeds  which he added to his store   then there were wild cherry pits  too  which the birds had dropped upon  the ground  all these  and many other kinds of food  found their way into  sandy chipmunk s home     much as he liked such things to eat  and especially sunflower seeds  he  never ate a single nut or grain or seed while he gathered them for his  winter s food  and when you stop to remember that he had to carry  everything home in his  mouth   you can see that sandy chipmunk had what  is called self control     his mother had always told him that he couldn t get through a winter  without that  and so  when sandy brought her to see his new home  after  it was all finished  and his bed was neatly made  and his storeroom full  of food  mrs  chipmunk was delighted      i m glad to see    she said   i m glad to see that all my talking has  done some good            vi    samples of wheat      there was so much said about sandy chipmunk s store of nuts and grain  that a few of the forest people began to wish they had some of sandy s  winter food for themselves  uncle sammy coon  an old scamp who lived over  near the swamp  was one of those who began to plan to get sandy s hoard  away from him     it was the grain that uncle sammy wanted  if he had spent in honest work  one half the time he used in planning some trickery he would have been  much better off  but he hated work more than anything else in the world     uncle sammy coon scarcely slept at all for several days  he was so busy  thinking about sandy s grain  and since he always passed his nights in  wandering through the woods  he became almost ill     the trouble was  uncle sammy was far too big to crawl inside sandy s  house  and he knew that the only way he could get at the grain was to  persuade somebody to bring it outside for him     at last he thought of a fine scheme  and as soon as it came into his head  he hobbled over to sandy chipmunk s home  i say  hobbled   because uncle  sammy had a lame knee  he always claimed that he was injured in battle   but almost every one knew that he hurt his knee one time when farmer  green caught him stealing a hen     when he reached the pasture uncle sammy found sandy chipmunk just  starting away to hunt for nuts      illustration  he dropped the grain in front of uncle sammy      good morning   the old fellow said  he spoke very pleasantly  though he  was so sleepy that he felt disagreeable enough   i ve come over to buy  something from your store       my store   sandy chipmunk exclaimed      yes   said uncle sammy coon   i ve heard you have a store here with a  heap of nuts and grain to sell      now  it had never occurred to sandy chipmunk to  sell  any of the food he  had gathered for the winter  but when uncle sammy put the idea in his  head sandy rather liked it      i have a fine stock  to be sure   he said   the nuts are specially good   how many would you like to buy      but uncle sammy coon told him he didn t want any nuts      i never eat them   he said   it s grain that i want  and i ll buy as  much as you care to sell     bring a sample of it up here   he urged    i d like to see if it s as good as people say      so sandy chipmunk darted into his house  and soon he appeared again with  his cheek pouches crammed full of wheat kernels      there   he cried  when he had dropped the grain in front of uncle sammy    just try a little of it  you ll agree with me that it s very fine      uncle sammy not only tried a little  he gobbled up every single kernel      it seems to me to have a queer taste   he said   bring up some more      and sandy scurried down into his house again  to bob up in a few moments  with another sample of his grain     once more uncle sammy ate it all      it s a bit damp   he remarked  as he smacked his lips   i hope it s not  moldy     you d better let me see another sample      uncle sammy declared the next heap of kernels to be altogether too dry   and he kept ordering sandy to fetch more for him to  taste   as he called  it  some of the wheat he considered too ripe  and some too green  some of  the kernels  so he said  were too little  and others too big  and finally  he even told sandy chipmunk that he was afraid sandy was trying to sell  him  last year s  wheat     now  sandy knew that his wheat was fresh  all of it  so he went down and  brought up still another load     uncle sammy ate that more slowly  for by this time he had had a good  meal      how do you like it   sandy asked him      it s fair   uncle sammy replied   but i believe it s  next year s   wheat  and of course i wouldn t think of buying that kind     i guess i  can t trade with you  after all   and he started to hobble away     when sandy heard that  and saw the old fellow leaving  he began to scold      aren t you going to pay me for what you ve eaten   he asked      what  pay you for the samples   uncle sammy asked   i guess  young man   you don t know much about keeping a store  nobody ever pays for samples    and he went away muttering to himself     sandy chipmunk felt very sad  uncle sammy had eaten half his winter s  supply of wheat     sandy was angry  too  and for several days he was busier than ever   trying to think of some way in which he could make uncle sammy coon pay  him           vii    uncle sammy s store      not long after uncle sammy coon ate half of sandy chipmunk s wheat  without paying for it he seemed to grow lamer than ever  and he walked  less than ever  too  a good many of the forest folk said that he really  wasn t any lamer  but he was lazier     however that may have been  he began to stay at home a good deal of the  time  and finally sandy chipmunk heard that uncle sammy had opened a  store  in which he kept all sorts of good things to eat     when sandy learned that he lost no time in going over to uncle sammy s  house near the swamp     sure enough  there he found uncle sammy sitting behind a long table  and  behind him were shelves loaded with apples  pears  corn  nuts and many  other kinds of food      i d like to buy some nuts   sandy chipmunk told the old gentleman      nuts   said uncle sammy   i have some fine nuts       let me see a sample   sandy said     but uncle sammy never stirred      there they are  right on the shelf   he said   look at them all  you want to       i ll eat one and see how i like it   said sandy chipmunk     but uncle sammy shook his head      no   he replied   that s the old fashioned way of keeping a store  i  don t give away any samples      when sandy heard that he was angrier than ever  and he wished he had  never given uncle sammy any samples of his wheat  but he knew there was  no use of  appearing angry   so he smiled and asked      what is the price of your beechnuts       for one handful  you will have to pay me an ear of corn   uncle  sammy said      i ll take a handful   said sandy     still the old fellow never stirred      where s your ear of corn   he inquired      oh  i ll give you that the next time i pass this way   said sandy  and  he made up his mind that he would take good care to keep away from uncle  sammy s house     but uncle sammy coon was too sharp      that won t do at all   he said   i must have the corn before i give you  the nuts      so sandy chipmunk stepped to the door      i ll come back soon   he said  and he ran all the way to farmer green s  cornfield  to get an ear of green corn  and then he ran all the way back  to uncle sammy s house      there   sandy said   there s your ear of corn   he laid it upon the  table   now give me a handful of beechnuts       step right in and help yourself   uncle sammy answered      no   said sandy   you give me the nuts   he knew that uncle sammy s  hands were much bigger than his own and would hold more nuts      i should think you might get them   the old scamp grumbled   i ve a lame  knee  you know       but i said a  handful   not a  kneeful    sandy answered   of course  if  you don t want this juicy ear of corn  there are others that would like  it   he started to pick the ear of corn off the table when uncle sammy  rose quickly      all right   he cried   but it s the old fashioned way  and i don t like  it   then he gave sandy a small handful of beechnuts     sandy chipmunk ate them right on the spot  and he began to feel very  happy  he had noticed that uncle sammy tossed the ear of corn into a  basket which stood beneath the table  and the basket was full of corn   sandy could reach it just as easily from the front of the table as uncle  sammy could from behind it     and sandy chipmunk had thought all at once of a way to get a good many  nuts away from uncle sammy  to pay for all the wheat uncle sammy had  eaten           viii    the basket of corn       what are those nuts on the top shelf   sandy chipmunk asked uncle  sammy coon     now  uncle sammy had been keeping store so short a time that he didn t  exactly know what was on every one of his shelves  so he wheeled around  and looked up  and as soon as his back was turned  sandy chipmunk reached  down under the table and pulled an ear of corn out of the big basket      they re butternuts   uncle sammy said   and they re the same price as  the beechnuts       give me one handful   sandy said       give  you a handful    uncle sammy snapped     but sandy chipmunk smiled at him      i mean   sell  me a handful   he explained   and here s your ear of  corn   it really was uncle sammy s ear of corn  you know  just as  sandy said     but uncle sammy didn t know that  he didn t know it had come out of his  own basket  so he threw it into the basket and set a handful of  butternuts before sandy chipmunk     sandy was longer eating those  for the shells were harder and thicker  than the beechnut shells  but in a little while he was ready for more      how about your chestnuts   he asked     and uncle sammy turned his back again      i have a few   he said      i ll buy a handful   sandy told him  as he pulled another ear of corn  out of the basket     and after that sandy bought hickory nuts and hazelnuts and walnuts      how about peanuts   he asked then   i ve never eaten any  but i ve heard  they are very good      uncle sammy stood up and searched his shelves very carefully  and while  he was searching  sandy chipmunk took six ears of green corn out of the  big basket under the table      i don t seem to have any peanuts   uncle sammy coon said at last      well  have you any nutmegs   sandy inquired     and while uncle sammy was looking for nutmegs  sandy chipmunk slyly took  six more ears from the basket  he had more corn now than he could carry   so he quickly tossed it out through the doorway      illustration  uncle sammy searched his shelves carefully     uncle sammy coon had to admit at last that he had no nutmegs  but sandy  kept him busy hunting for almonds and brazil nuts and pecans  though he  knew well enough that nothing of the sort grew in those woods     by the time uncle sammy stopped looking there was no more corn left in  his basket  but there was a great pile of corn on the ground just outside  his door  where sandy chipmunk had thrown it     then sandy said he must be going  and long before uncle sammy stirred out  of his house sandy had carried the corn away and hid it in a good  safe  place  he thought that if he left it to dry it would make just as good  food for winter as the wheat uncle sammy had eaten  and that was just  what happened     that night  long after sandy chipmunk had left the store  uncle sammy  coon had a great surprise  when he went to the basket  to get some green  corn for his supper  there was not a single ear there      that s queer   uncle sammy coon exclaimed   it was full this afternoon   and now there s not an ear left  i don t remember eating it   he thought  deeply for a long time  and after a while he said to himself   i wonder  if it could have been that chipmunk boy   but he decided that sandy was  too small to have carried away all those big ears under his very nose   i  must have eaten it   he told himself   i m getting terribly forgetful      and since he thought he had already had his supper  uncle sammy coon went  to bed without any supper at all           ix    working for mr  crow      old mr  crow had decided that he would not fly south to spend the  winter  he said he was getting almost too old for such a long journey   and he remembered  too  that he had heard the weather was going to be  mild that winter      there s just one thing that worries me   he told aunt polly woodchuck  one day  when he was talking the matter over with her   i don t know what  i shall have to eat       why  you can sleep until spring  just as i do   aunt polly said   then  you won t want anything to eat      but mr  crow said he was a light sleeper and that he could no more sleep  the whole winter long than aunt polly could fly      then why don t you store up some corn  the way the squirrels do   she  asked him  there was one thing about aunt polly  she always had a remedy  for everything      that s a good idea   mr  crow told her   maybe i can get somebody to  help me  too      and that very day he went to sandy chipmunk and asked him if he didn t  want to gather some food for him      how much will you pay me   sandy asked him      i ll give you half what you gather for me   said mr  crow   and that s  certainly fair  i m sure  it s often done  and it s called  working at  the halves       it seemed fair to sandy chipmunk  too      that s a bargain   he said   i ll begin right away  where do you want me  to hide the food for you  mr  crow      old mr  crow told sandy to put it in his house in the top of the tall elm  tree      i don t like to climb so high   sandy objected   you know i m not so  good a climber as frisky squirrel  he wouldn t mind climbing up to your  house  but it might make me dizzy       well   said mr  crow   why don t you bring the food to the foot of my  tree and get frisky squirrel to carry it to the top       i ll do it   said sandy chipmunk   if frisky is willing   so he went off  to find frisky squirrel  who proved to be much interested in the plan      how much will you pay me   he asked sandy chipmunk      i suppose you ought to have half the food   sandy said   that s what  mr  crow is paying me      frisky squirrel said that that seemed fair  so they set to work at once   and every time sandy brought a load of food to the foot of the tall elm   where mr  crow lived  he found frisky squirrel waiting for him      let s see    frisky said  when sandy brought the first load   since i m  to get half  i ll take everything you bring in your left cheek pouch  and  you can take what you bring in the right one      sandy chipmunk said that that seemed fair  so each time he came to the  elm he left with frisky only what he carried in his left cheek pouch  and  before gathering more food he scampered home to store away his own share     so the day passed  and when evening came  and the sun was dropping out  of sight in the west  sandy and frisky decided they had worked long  enough for mr  crow      don t you suppose he has enough food by this time   sandy asked  he  looked up at mr  crow s house   we mustn t fill his house too full   he  said   he has to have room for himself  you know       i don t think he ll have any trouble getting inside it   frisky  squirrel answered      well  i m glad you helped me   sandy told him   if it didn t make me  dizzy to climb so high i d like to take a look at mr  crow s food  i hope  he ll be pleased       i hope he will   frisky squirrel agreed     sandy chipmunk noticed that frisky squirrel was smiling  but he thought  that it was only because he was thinking about mr  crow  and how happy  he would be      let s wait here till he comes home   sandy suggested     but frisky squirrel said that he was going to bed early that night   because he expected to have a race with the sun the next morning      i m going to try to beat him   he explained   i m going to see if i  can t get up before he does      so frisky said good night and left sandy to wait for mr  crow alone           x    mr  crow scolds sandy      when he finally reached home  after sandy chipmunk had been working for  him all day  mr  crow was feeling very pleasant  you know  he thought  that his winter s food must be in his house  and that alone is enough to  make any one happy  but what mr  crow liked most about his bargain was  the fact that he wouldn t have to pay sandy for his work  he had said to  sandy   i ll agree to give you half what you gather for me   and sandy  chipmunk had never stopped to think that that was not any pay at all  for  he might have gathered the food for himself  and had all  instead of  only half of it  as it was  sandy chipmunk was paying himself for working  for mr  crow  and mr  crow seemed to be the only one that was wise enough  to know it     mr  crow dropped down upon the ground beside sandy chipmunk      well   he said   have you finished       yes   sandy answered   and i hope you ll like what i ve done  i ll wait  here until you fly up to your house and look at the food       all right   mr  crow told him  he flapped his big  black wings  and soon  he had risen to the top of the tall elm     sandy watched him as he looked inside his house  at first mr  crow only  stared  and said nothing  and then  to sandy s astonishment  he began to  scold      what s the trouble   sandy chipmunk called      trouble   mr  crow cried  as he flew down again   there s trouble  enough  why  you haven t kept your bargain      sandy chipmunk declared that he had done exactly as he had agreed      i brought load after load of food to the foot of this tree    he explained   half of it i took for myself  just as you suggested  of  course  i had to pay frisky squirrel for helping me  i paid him half the  food for carrying it up to your house       that s it   mr  crow cried   that s the trouble  you took half and  frisky squirrel took half  so of course there was no food left for me   there are two halves in a whole  you know       you must be mistaken   sandy told him politely   there s only  one  half  in my hole  i put my half there myself  and i ought to know      mr  crow looked as if he thought sandy chipmunk must be playing a trick  on him  but pretty soon he saw that it was not so      you don t seem to understand   mr  crow said   i don t believe you ve  ever studied fractions      sandy chipmunk admitted that he never had      ah   mr  crow exclaimed   this is what comes of hiring stupid people  to work for one  here i ve wasted all my corn  and i get nothing for it  but trouble       corn   sandy chipmunk exclaimed   i don t know anything about any corn       well  you certainly are stupid   mr  crow told him crossly   didn t you  spend the whole day gathering corn for me       no  indeed   sandy replied   i gathered beechnuts  mr  crow       beechnuts   mr  crow repeated   i never told you i wanted  nuts   i d  starve  trying to live on nuts  for they don t agree with me at all  and  i make it a rule never to eat them   corn  is what i want       you didn t say so   sandy chipmunk said   you asked me to gather  food   for you  and every one knows there s no better food than beechnuts to  last through the winter       that    said mr  crow   that is where we do not agree  i supposed you  knew i wanted corn  but there s no great harm done  anyhow   he added    tomorrow you can gather  corn  for me  now that you know what i want  no  doubt you can get frisky squirrel to help you again  but you must pay him  with  your  share of the corn  not with mine       but then there wouldn t be any left for me   sandy objected      but just think of all the beechnuts you have   mr  crow reminded him     sandy chipmunk shook his head   i m afraid i m too stupid to work for  you any more   he told mr  crow      oh  i didn t mean what i said   mr  crow hastened to explain      then    sandy said   then how do i know that you mean what you say when  you tell me you want corn to eat      and mr  crow could find no answer to that  he was disappointed  too  for  he was afraid he would have to go south to spend the winter  after all           xi    the mail box      climbing an oak at the cross roads one day  not far from farmer green s  house  sandy chipmunk discovered a queer box nailed to the trunk of the  tree  much as he wanted to  he couldn t look inside the box  because its  lid was closed  and since sandy was afraid the box might be some sort of  trap  he didn t dare go near it and poke at the lid     later that day sandy told frisky squirrel about the strange box  and  frisky told fatty coon  and fatty coon told somebody else     so the news traveled  until at last it reached the sharp ears of old mr   crow     by the time mr  crow heard the story it had grown amazingly  and it went  something like this  farmer green had bought a new trap in the village   and he had nailed it on a tree to catch all sorts of animals and birds   and after he had caught all the forest folk in pleasant valley he  intended to take the trap to swift river and set it for fish and eels  and turtles     when mr  crow heard the news he  haw hawed  loudly      what are you laughing about   jasper jay asked him   it was jasper who  repeated the story to mr  crow    you wouldn t think it was such a joke  if you were caught in the trap       trap   mr  crow sneered   that s no trap  that s what s called a   mail box   every day a man with letters and newspapers drives over here  from the village  and he stops at the cross roads and leaves something in  the box for farmer green      as soon as he heard that  jasper jay flew away to tell everybody about  the mail box  and at last sandy chipmunk heard the story  but by the time  it reached his ears  after it had been told by one person to another  almost forty times  the story was somewhat different from what it had  been when mr  crow first told it to jasper jay  this is what sandy heard   the thing on the tree was a mailbox  every day a man drove from the  village in a wagon drawn by twelve horses  he had a load of letters as  big as six haystacks  and he left a handful of letters in that box   because he wanted to get rid of them so he could go back to the village  for more  and any one could take a letter  if it happened to be for him     it was frisky squirrel who told the story to sandy  of course  after so  much telling it had changed a good deal  but sandy chipmunk didn t know  that  and he hurried to the cross roads at once  to watch for the man  driving the twelve horses     when he reached the oak  where the box was  sandy climbed the tree and  perched himself on a limb and waited  he had not sat there long before he  saw a man drive up the road  sandy chipmunk was surprised when the man  stopped beneath the tree and dropped some letters and newspapers into the  box  he was surprised because the man drove only one horse  instead of  twelve  and the man had only a single bag of mail in his wagon  instead  of a great heap  as big as six haystacks     sandy chipmunk was somewhat disappointed  but he was glad of one thing   the man left the lid of the box open  and as soon as he had driven on  again  sandy crept down the tree and crawled right inside the mail box     though he was not expecting a letter from anybody  he thought it would be  just as well to look and see if the man had left one for him     now  sandy had never learned to read  and you might think it would do him  no good at all to look at the envelopes  but he soon came upon one which  he was sure was his  and the reason for that was that he had found an  envelope with the picture of a chipmunk in one corner of it     that was enough for sandy      i m glad i came   he said to himself   here s a letter for me  and how  surprised everybody will be      so he took the letter in his mouth and started down the tree     the very first person he surprised was farmer green himself  he had  walked to the cross roads from his house  and he had almost reached the  oak when he saw sandy chipmunk spring from the tree to the stone wall   with a letter in his mouth  and scamper away     farmer green ran after sandy  and he threw stones at him  but sandy  chipmunk ran so fast that farmer green soon lost sight of him      i d like to know what was in that letter   farmer green said  when he  told his family what had happened   i ll have to warn the letter carrier  to be sure to close the mail box after this  for i can t have any more of  my letters stolen      johnnie green couldn t help laughing  when he heard his father tell about  the chipmunk running away with a letter in his mouth      illustration   here s a letter for me   said sandy chipmunk     but farmer green didn t seem to see anything to laugh at      i only hope   he said   the letter was nothing of importance            xii    sandy gets a letter      after sandy chipmunk  with the letter in his mouth  escaped from farmer  green  he ran home and showed his letter to everybody he met  he felt  very proud      see   he said   there was a letter for me in the mail box  it s lucky i  found it when i did  for i believe farmer green would have taken it if i  hadn t reached the box before him      old mr  crow laughed mockingly when sandy called to him that he had a  letter      i see you  have  one   mr  crow said   but the question is  to whom does  it really belong  if the truth were known  i guess that letter rightfully  belongs to a farmer named green      that remark made sandy angry      the letter belongs to me   he told mr  crow   here s my picture on it   you can see for yourself      now  mr  crow could not read either  for all he was so old  and when he  saw the picture of a chipmunk on the envelope  exactly like sandy  he was  very much surprised      why don t you open your letter   he asked      i hadn t thought of that   sandy replied  so he tore open the envelope  and pulled out a paper      it s certainly for me   he said   for here s my picture again  but i d  like to know why these other people have their pictures in  my  letter   they ve no business in  my  letter      mr  crow looked over sandy s shoulder  which was not at all a polite  thing to do      that s queer   mr  crow exclaimed   there s one of the red squirrel boys  and mrs  mouse s son  and this young chap here looks a lot like rinaldo  rat      i d be pretty angry if anybody sent me a letter like that   mr   crow then said     now  the real trouble with mr  crow was that he was jealous because sandy  chipmunk had a letter  while  he  had none      i d throw that letter away  if it was mine   remarked mr  crow  and he  said so much that at last sandy chipmunk tossed the letter away and went  off to hunt for birds  eggs     as soon as sandy was out of sight  mr  crow picked up the letter and flew  home with it     he felt better  because at last he had a letter  while sandy chipmunk no  longer had one     that very afternoon farmer green drove to the village  and on his way he  stopped at the houses of several of his neighbors  to talk about the  weather and the crops  and each one of them showed him a letter that had  come that day  telling all about a new kind of poison  to rid a farmer of  chipmunks and red squirrels and rats and mice      sprinkle our powder around your corn crib   the letter said   and these  little rodents will trouble you no longer       i declare   cried farmer green at last   i seem to be the only person in  the neighborhood that didn t get one of those letters   then he happened  to remember the letter sandy chipmunk had carried away in his mouth   it  must have been that letter that the chipmunk stole out of my mail box    farmer green said  and that night  when he reached home and told his  family about the letter  his son johnnie laughed harder than ever      that must be a wise chipmunk   johnnie green exclaimed   i wish i could  catch him and put him in my squirrel cage       i wish he d leave my mail alone   said farmer green   the next thing we  know  he ll be taking my newspaper to read  and maybe he ll come right  into the house and borrow my spectacles      johnnie green seemed to think his father was joking  and perhaps he was     what do you think about it           xiii    a ride to the miller s      do you know about the time johnnie green and his grandmother and sandy  chipmunk started for the miller s with a sack of wheat to be ground  if  you never heard the story  this is the way it happened  and if you  have   heard it  it happened this way  just the same     farmer green s wife had noticed that the flour in her flour barrel was  getting low  so one morning farmer green pulled a wagon from under a shed  and set a big bag of wheat in it  behind the seat  then he went into the  house to get a piece of string with which to tie the bag  farmer green  hadn t seen a pair of bright eyes that were watching him from the fence  near by  and he didn t know that as soon as he started to cross the  barnyard  sandy chipmunk stole up to the wagon  climbed into it  and  crept inside the open bag of wheat     now  sandy had not had his breakfast  so he began at once to eat heartily  of the wheat kernels  believing that after he had had a good meal it  would be time enough to think of carrying some of the wheat away to his  house  he only hoped that no one would take the bag away until he had  removed  all  the wheat  there was enough of it  he was sure  to last him  for any number of winters     now  you must not think that sandy was greedy  because he wanted all that  wheat  he intended all the time to leave the  bag  for farmer green     the wheat tasted so good that sandy chipmunk could think of nothing  else  so he never heard johnnie green s father when he came back from  the house  and before sandy knew what was happening  farmer green had  reached into the wagon  drawn the mouth of the bag together  and tied it  hard and fast     there was sandy chipmunk  inside the bag  and he was so frightened that  he couldn t eat another mouthful  he just shivered and shook  while  farmer green went into the barn  led out an old  slow horse called  ebenezer  and harnessed him to the wagon     then johnnie green and his grandmother came out and seated themselves in  the wagon  farmer green gave johnnie the reins  and ebenezer started  jogging down the road toward the miller s  with johnnie s old straw hat  and his grandmother s sunbonnet bobbing from side to side  and up and  down  and backwards and forwards  as the wagon jolted over ruts and  stones and thank you ma ams  which were small ridges built across the  road  to turn the water into the ditch when it rained     cowering inside the bag  sandy chipmunk thought the earth was rocking   for he had never ridden in a wagon before     although the sack was a stout one  sandy could easily have gnawed his way  through it if he had not been too frightened to try  and there he stayed   while all the time old ebenezer kept plodding along toward the  grist mill     johnnie green and his grandmother  talking so near him  only alarmed  sandy all the more  and he thought he could not be more scared than he  was  but all at once the wagon lurched forward and grandmother green  screamed  and johnnie began to cry  whoa  whoa   in a loud voice     then sandy chipmunk began to shake harder than ever  he had no idea what  was happening           xiv    a lucky accident      it was really no wonder that johnnie green s grandmother screamed  when  she and johnnie and sandy chipmunk were on their way to the miller s to  get the wheat ground into flour     this was what made the good old lady scream  the ancient horse  ebenezer   was picking his way slowly down a steep hill  placing one foot carefully  in front of another  and taking pains not to step on the stones in the  road  so he wouldn t fall     what happened was not ebenezer s fault at all  you see  he was wearing an  old harness  and just as he was on the steepest part of the hill a strap  broke and the wagon rolled right upon his heels     now  many horses would have kicked and run  if such a thing had happened  to them  but even when johnnie s grandmother screamed  old ebenezer was  not at all frightened  and even when johnnie cried  whoa  whoa   ebenezer  did not stop  he thought he knew a good deal more about what he ought to  do than johnnie green did  for he had been pulling a wagon for almost  twenty years before johnnie green was born     johnnie tugged hard upon the reins  but still old ebenezer went on  picking his way even more slowly  and he never stopped until he reached  the bottom of the hill  then he stood stock still  and he looked around  at johnnie green  as if to say   there  young man  i ve brought you and  your grandma safe down that hill  and  now  i ll let you get out of the  wagon  if you want to      well  johnnie green jumped down from his seat and looked at the harness      dear me   his grandmother said   if we only had a piece of string you  could mend the harness so we could get to the miller s  at least      johnnie felt in all his pockets  and probably that was the first time he  had ever found himself without plenty of string  there were enough other  things in his pockets  a jackknife and nails  an apple and a lump of  maple sugar  an old broken watch and a willow whistle  but not a single  piece of string could johnnie green find     then he happened to think of the string his father had used to tie up the  sack of wheat  johnnie stood the sack on end  tipped it against the back  of the seat  so the wheat wouldn t fall out  and unwound the string from  the mouth of the bag     he had hardly begun to tie the harness together when grandmother green  screamed again     the horse ebenezer looked around once more  as if to say   i wonder  what s come over the old lady      and johnnie green turned his head  too      my goodness   his grandmother said   did you see that  something ran  right up my back and jumped off my shoulder  there it goes now   she  pointed at a small object which was scurrying through the roadside fence    why  it was a chipmunk  i do believe   she cried   now  where do you  suppose he came from      johnnie green didn t know  and to tell the truth  he didn t much care   you see  he felt very proud  mending the harness with nobody to help  him  and he was not interested in chipmunks just then     so sandy escaped  to be sure  he was so far from home that he didn t know  where he was  but he was so glad to get out of the sack of wheat that he  didn t worry about being lost  he thought he could find some one who  would know where farmer green s pasture was           xv    the rowdy of the woods      one of the most quarrelsome of all sandy chipmunk s neighbors was rowdy  red squirrel  he was happiest when he was fighting  but perhaps that was  because he had never lost a fight  if rowdy had had a sound beating   maybe fighting would not have seemed so pleasant to him     ever since rowdy whipped frisky squirrel  who  being a gray squirrel  was  bigger than he was  rowdy bullied every squirrel in the neighborhood  no  matter what color he might be  as for chipmunks  rowdy red squirrel  boasted that he could whip six chipmunks at a time      that is  i could if they would stand still   he said   of course  if  they ran off in six different directions it might be a hard thing to do      rowdy was talking to jasper jay  who sat in a tree not far away  his  boasting amused jasper  first jasper smiled  then he laughed aloud  and  after that he gave a hoarse shriek  which rang through the woods most  unpleasantly  at least  that was what rowdy red squirrel thought      what s the joke   he asked      the joke   jasper answered   why  ha  ha    you  are the joke  i don t  believe you can whip  one  chipmunk  and when you talk of whipping  six    i can t help laughing       you wouldn t laugh if i could catch you   rowdy red squirrel growled   and if he hadn t known that jasper jay would fly away  he would have  jumped into jasper s tree and chased him      you mustn t expect me to believe you can whip  six  until i ve seen you  whip  one    jasper went on   there s sandy chipmunk in that beech tree   why don t you steal over there and show me whether you can whip him       i ll do it   rowdy cried   not that i find much pleasure in fighting a  single chipmunk  for i can whip  one  with my hands tied behind me       can you   jasper jay asked   then let me see you tie your hands       i can t   rowdy red squirrel replied   who ever heard of anybody who  could tie his own hands behind him      you  will have to do that for  me   he said     jasper jay gave another loud shriek and rocked back and forth on the limb  where he sat      another joke   he gasped  for he was too clever to be caught like that   he had no idea of going near enough to rowdy red squirrel to tie his  hands behind his back      well  i see i ll have to whip sandy chipmunk just as i am   rowdy  grumbled   it won t be much fun for me       i don t believe it will   jasper jay agreed      after i whip him  you ll have to find six more chipmunks for me  if you  want to see me fight them all at once   rowdy red squirrel told jasper  jay      i ll do it  if you whip sandy   jasper promised  and he laughed so hard  that he almost tumbled off the limb           xvi    rowdy runs away      rowdy red squirrel jumped from one tree into another until he reached the  beech tree in which jasper jay had caught sight of sandy chipmunk     now  sandy had not seen rowdy stealing upon him  and the first he knew  about the fight was when he happened to turn around  then he saw rowdy  red squirrel right in front of him  and before sandy could move  rowdy  had jumped straight at him     now  as you know  sandy chipmunk was not the most nimble of climbers  he  was a ground squirrel  and though he often climbed into the lower  branches of trees  he always felt more comfortable on the top of a  rail fence or a stone wall     but rowdy red squirrel could cling to the smallest branch  the more it  swayed beneath his weight the better he liked it  his hardest battles had  been fought in the tree tops  you see  he was never the least bit afraid  of falling     sandy chipmunk was plucky  as you know  and at first he had no thought of  running away  when rowdy red squirrel jumped at him  even when rowdy sank  his sharp teeth into one of his ears  sandy fought his hardest  but when  rowdy pulled on his ear  sandy s feet almost slipped off the limb     then sandy tried to get away  and at last he tore his ear out of rowdy  red squirrel s mouth and scurried quickly to the ground     rowdy red squirrel  dashing after him  shouted with glee      he s running away from me  i ve whipped him   he called to jasper jay   who had come nearer  to see the fight     sandy chipmunk had reached the stone wall between the woods and the  pasture  and he was still running  but the moment rowdy red squirrel  sprang upon the wall  to his great surprise sandy whisked around and  jumped straight at  him      it was rowdy s turn to be startled  and when sandy gave his nose a cruel  bite rowdy turned tail and darted off as fast as he could go     after him dashed sandy chipmunk  no longer was he afraid of falling  he  was quite at home on the stone wall  he knew every stone in it  and every  nook and cranny  he knew exactly the best way to run along that old  wall  so all he had to think about now was catching rowdy red squirrel     but rowdy escaped  after he had run a long way he jumped into a tree and  climbed to the very top of it  where sandy chipmunk did not care to  follow him      come down here  if you want to fight   sandy called to him      you can t fool me   rowdy answered   the  other six of you  are hiding  behind the wall  and the moment i came down you d all jump at me again  i  said i could whip  six  chipmunks  but  seven  are one too many      sandy chipmunk didn t know what rowdy was talking about  and he could not  understand what made jasper jay laugh so loudly      you played a trick on me   rowdy told jasper jay   you had six  chipmunks hidden behind that wall  and as soon as i came down where they  were  they all sprang at me  with sandy chipmunk  there were  seven  of  them  and that s one too many       ha  ha   laughed jasper jay   yes  there s  one too many for you   sandy  chipmunk is  one too many for you    and he flew away to tell the joke to  every one     you see  rowdy had been so frightened when sandy turned and bit his nose  that he actually thought there must be at least seven chipmunks chasing  him     though he boasted just as much afterwards  rowdy red squirrel never  wanted to fight sandy chipmunk again           xvii    corn planting time      it was late in the spring  and sandy chipmunk couldn t help wishing it  was late in the fall instead  the reason for that was this  he could find  very little to eat anywhere in pleasant valley  it was too early for  fruit or nuts  it was even too early for many insects  and it seemed to  sandy that all the insects flew much higher than they did when there were  plenty of other things to eat     at last sandy chanced to see mr  crow in the woods one day  mr  crow was  just about to fly somewhere  he seemed to be in a great hurry  in fact   he did not want to stop to talk  which was most unusual with him      i can t chat with you to day   mr  crow told sandy   i have business to  attend to  it s something i ve been expecting for a long time  and i  don t want to be late       where are you going   sandy asked      that    said mr  crow   that is something that doesn t concern you   young man   and then he flapped his way through the woods and out of  sight     now  it happened that sandy chipmunk remembered at once what uncle  jerry chuck had said a few days before  uncle jerry had said that mr   crow had told him farmer green was about to plant corn  so sandy  guessed that mr  crow was going to the field where farmer green and his  hired man were working      i ll run over there and see what s going on   sandy exclaimed   if  they re planting corn i have just as much right to eat some as mr   crow has      of course  mr  crow reached the ploughed field long before sandy  chipmunk  it took mr  crow no time at all to sail through the air and  drop down at a good  safe distance from where farmer green and his hired  man were planting corn  they had already planted several long rows  and  mr  crow at once set to work to scratch up the yellow kernels and swallow  them greedily     he was enjoying his meal greatly when he caught sight of a small  striped  person busily engaged in doing the very same thing  it was sandy  chipmunk  and mr  crow hurried over to the row where sandy was looking  for corn      what are you doing here   mr  crow asked angrily      i might ask you the same question   sandy answered      you followed me  that s what you did   mr  crow exclaimed   of all the  prying busybodies i know  you are certainly the worst  this is not your  field  and i shall have to ask you to leave it at once       oh  i ll leave the field   said sandy chipmunk   i don t want the field   you can have  that   all i want is some of the corn  there ought to be  enough for both of us      mr  crow muttered something about  impertinence   which sandy chipmunk  didn t understand  then mr  crow said      this corn belongs to farmer green  just because i ve come to help him   and because i ve scratched up a few of the kernels to see if he s  planting them properly  you seem to think i m  eating corn        i certainly do   said sandy chipmunk      well  what an idea   mr  crow exclaimed     strange as it may seem  farmer green had the same idea that sandy  chipmunk had  he happened to catch sight of old mr  crow  and pretty soon  johnnie green came hurrying up the field  along the fence  he hoped mr   crow wouldn t see him     but old mr  crow generally saw any one coming his way  especially if the  person happened to have a gun on his shoulder      i ve important business over in the woods   he told sandy chipmunk  suddenly  and he flew off in great haste     so sandy stayed and ate all the corn he wanted  he was so small and so  nearly the same color as the ploughed field that johnnie green never saw  him at all     after that mr  crow would scarcely speak to sandy for several days  he  said that sandy was a nuisance      a person can t go anywhere without that chipmunk boy following him   mr   crow complained   you know  i m helping farmer green plant his corn  and  sandy chipmunk followed me to the corn patch  and what do you think  he  actually began to  eat  the corn  now  who ever heard of such a thing      but mr  crow fooled nobody but himself  every one knew that he ate more  of farmer green s corn than anybody else unless it was farmer green  and   he  always waited until it was ripe     the trouble with mr  crow was this  he didn t want any one but himself to  visit the cornfield  he wanted all the corn for an old gentleman known as   mr  crow            xviii    sandy likes milk      sandy chipmunk liked milk  he never knew it  though  until he chanced to  come upon a saucerful which some one had set out on the big flat stone  that served as the back doorstep of the farmhouse     sandy crept up and sniffed at the white liquid in the saucer  it smelled  very good  so he tasted it  and it tasted so much better  even  than it  smelled that he drank every drop of it     sandy was sitting on the big stone step  washing his face  when farmer  green s cat leaped out of the doorway     the cat was very angry  and it was no wonder  because sandy chipmunk had  drunk her breakfast  she seemed to think that since sandy had made away  with her breakfast it would be only fair if she should make away with   him       illustration  farmer green s cat leaped out of the doorway     but sandy did not agree with her at all  though he had washed only one  side of his face  he jumped sideways off the step and ran and hid in the  woodpile close by     you might think he would have had to stay there a long time  for the old  cat crouched down and watched the hole into which sandy had crawled  she  seemed to have made up her mind to wait there until sandy came out of  that hole again     if she had waited for that to happen she would have been there yet  for  sandy crept through the woodpile  stole out the other side of it  and ran  home     he was glad to get away from the cat  but he was sorry there wasn t more  of that delicious drink which he had found in the saucer     later that day sandy told fatty coon what had happened      i know what that was   fatty coon exclaimed   it was milk       i wonder where farmer green gets it   sandy said      from the cows  of course   fatty replied      you don t say so   sandy chipmunk cried   i m glad to know it   and he  scampered off across the pasture  toward three of farmer green s cows  which were chewing their cuds under the shade of a big maple tree     when sandy asked them if they would please give him some milk to drink  two of the cows  they were the good natured ones  only smiled at each  other  but the third cow  a surly old creature with long  sharp horns   told him not to be silly     well  sandy chipmunk saw that he could get no milk there  and he was  feeling quite downcast when he chanced to meet henry skunk  to whom he  told his troubles      of course the cows couldn t give you any milk   henry skunk said   it s  not milking time yet  so what could they do  you go down to the barnyard  late this afternoon and you ll find all the milk you could drink in a  thousand years      sandy chipmunk thanked him  and somehow he managed to wait until the  afternoon was almost gone  then he skipped down the hill to farmer  green s barn  he thought it must be milking time  because johnnie green  and old dog spot had driven all the cows home           xix    what the old cow did      when sandy chipmunk reached farmer green s barn he crept inside and  looked all around  he had expected to find the barn crowded with saucers  full of milk  but not a single saucer did he see  there were two long  rows of cows stabled in the barn  and sandy noticed farmer green and his  boy and his hired man  each sitting on a low stool beside a cow  they  were milking the cows  but sandy did not know it     he began to think that henry skunk had played a trick on him  and he was  about to leave the barn when he turned to look at several bright tin  pails standing on the floor     sandy crept up to one of them and sniffed at it  he was glad that he had  done that  for he smelled  milk   there was no mistake about it     sandy chipmunk couldn t crawl up the side of the pail  it was so smooth  and slippery  so he jumped right up and stood on its edge  and looking  inside  he saw that the pail was almost full of milk  he knew then that  henry skunk had told the truth     by bending down sandy was just able to reach the milk  and he began  drinking it as fast as he could  it was so delicious that he forgot all  about johnnie green and his father and the hired man     with his head inside the pail  of course sandy couldn t see what happened  in the barn  the more he drank  the further down he had to stretch his  neck  and when at last he heard a shout  and a milking stool came sailing  through the air not far above the pail  sandy was so startled that he  lost his balance and went  plump   into the milk     luckily  sandy chipmunk knew how to swim  so he managed to keep his nose  in the air or he would certainly have drowned      where on earth did that chipmunk go   he heard johnnie green say as he  picked up his stool  you see  johnnie never once thought of looking  inside the pail     still  sandy chipmunk was in a fix  for the inside of the pail was as  smooth and slippery as the outside  and of course he couldn t  jump  out   for there was nothing from which he could spring     now it happened that the pail of milk stood not far behind the surly old  cow that had told sandy not to be silly  when he asked her for some milk  to drink  in the pasture that day  johnnie green s shouting and the stool  hurtling through the air displeased her  and since she was not the sort  to hide her ill nature  she promptly kicked the milkpail over     for a moment sandy chipmunk thought that this time the end of the world  had certainly come  the old cow s foot crashed against the pail and sent  it flying against the stone wall on which the barn was built  and sandy  tumbled out upon the floor in a sea of milk     he didn t wait to learn exactly what had happened  for as soon as he  could scramble to his feet he dashed out of the barn and tore across the  fields towards the pasture     later  when he reached his house and sat down to rest  he soon forgot  his fright  for he had a very pleasant time licking himself clean  that  was the way sandy chipmunk always made himself spick and span  and though  there may be some people who would not consider such an act to be in the  best of taste  sandy chipmunk thought what was left of the milk  tasted  very good   and since his mother did not object to what he was doing   perhaps no one else ought to       the end                             your afterself                                the  man  you  ought                            to be  may in his time                          be possible and actual  far                        away in the twenties  the thirties                      of the twentieth century  he is awaiting                    his turn  his body  his brain  his soul are in                  your boyish hands  he cannot help himself  what will                you leave for him  will it be a brain unspoiled by lust or              dissipation  a mind trained to think and act  a nervous system            true as a dial in its response to the truth about you  will you               boy of the twentieth century  let him come as a man among men                in his time  or will you throw away his inheritance before                  he has had the chance to touch it  will you let him come                     taking your place  gaining through your experiences                       hallowed through your joys  building on them his                        own  or  will  you  fling  his  hope  away                           decreeing  wanton like  that the man                            you might have been shall never                                     be                the new century has come upon us with a rush of energy that no century has  shown before  let us stand aside for a moment that we may see what kind of  a century it is to be  what is the work it has to do  and what manner of  men it will demand to do it     in most regards one century is like another  just as men are men  so times  are times  in the twentieth century there will be the same joys  the same  sorrows  the same marrying and giving in marriage  the same round of work  and play  of wisdom and duty  of folly and distress which other centuries  have seen  just as each individual man has the same organs  the same  passions  the same functions as all others  so it is with all the  centuries  but we know men not by their likenesses  which are many  but by  differences in emphasis  by individual traits which are slight and subtle   but all important in determining our likes and dislikes  our friendships   loves  and hates  so with the centuries  we remember those which are past  not by the mass of common traits in history and development  but by the few  events or thoughts unnoticed at the time  but which stand out like mountain  peaks raised  above oblivion s sea   when the times are all gathered in and  the century begins to blend with the  infinite azure of the past   not wars  and conquests mark a century  the hosts grow small in the vanishing  perspective   the captains and the kings depart   but the thoughts of men   their attitude toward their environment  their struggles toward  duty   these are the things which endure     compared with the centuries that are past  the twentieth century in its  broad outlines will be like the rest  it will be selfish  generous   careless  devoted  fatuous  efficient  but three of its traits must stand  out above all others  each raised to a higher degree than any other century  has known  the twentieth century above all others will be  strenuous   complex   and  democratic   strenuous the century must be  of  course  this we can all see  and we have to thank the young man of the  twentieth century who gave us the watchword of  the strenuous life   and  who has raised the apt phrase to the dignity of a national purpose  our  century has a host of things to do  bold things  noble things  tedious  things  difficult things  enduring things  it has only a hundred years to  do them in  and two of these years are gone already  we must be up and  bestir ourselves  if we are called to help in this work  there is no time  for an idle minute  idle men and idle women no doubt will cumber our way   for there are many who have never heard of the work to do  many who will  never know that there has been a new century  these the century will pass  by with the gentle tolerance she shows to clams and squirrels  but on those  of us she calls to her service she will lay heavy burdens of duty   the  color of life is red   already the fad of the drooping spirit  the  end of the century pose  has given way to the rush of the strenuous life   to the feeling that struggle brings its own reward  the men who are doing  ask no favor at the end  life is repaid by the joy of living it     as the century is strenuous so will it be complex  the applications of  science have made the great world small  while every part of it has grown  insistent  as the earth has shrunk to come within our grasp  so has our own  world expanded to receive it   my mind to me a kingdom is   and to this  kingdom all the other kingdoms of the earth now send their embassadors  the  complexity of life is shown by the extension of the necessity of choice   each of us has to render a decision  to say yes or no a hundred times when  our grandfathers were called upon a single time  we must say yes or no to  our neighbors  theories or plans or desires  and whoever has lived or lives  or may yet live in any land or on any island of the sea has become our  neighbor  through modern civilization we are coming into our inheritance   and this heirloom includes the best that any man has done or thought since  history and literature and art began  it includes  too  all the arts and  inventions by which any men of any time have separated truth from error  of  one blood are all the people of the earth  and whatsoever is done to the  least of these little ones in some degree comes to me  we suffer from the  miasma of the indian jungles  we starve with the savages of the harvestless  islands  we grow weak with the abused peasants of the russian steppes  who  leave us the legacy of their grippe  the great volcano which buries far off  cities at its foot casts its pitying dust over us  it is said that through  the bonds of commerce  common trade  and common need  there is growing up  the fund of a great  bank of human kindness   no genuine draft on which is  ever left dishonored  whoever is in need of help the world over  by that  token has a claim on us     in our material life we draw our resources from every land  clothing   spices  fruits  toys  household furniture   we lay contributions on the  whole world for the most frugal meal  for the humblest dwelling  we need  the best work of every nation and every nation asks our best of us  the day  of home brewed ale  of home made bread  and home spun clothing is already  past with us  better than we can do  our neighbors send us  and we must  send our own best in return  with home made garments also pass away  inherited politics and hereditary religion  with all the support of caste  and with all its barriers  we must work all this out for ourselves  we must  make our own place in society  we must frame our own creeds  we must live  our own religion  for no longer can one man s religion be taken  unquestionably by any other  as the world has been unified  so is the  individual unit exalted  with all this  the simplicity of life is passing  away  our front doors are wide open as the trains go by  the caravan  traverses our front yard  we speak to millions  millions speak to us  and  we must cultivate the social tact  the gentleness  the adroitness  the  firmness necessary to carry out our own designs without thwarting those of  others  time no longer flows on evenly  we must count our moments  so much  for ourselves  so much for the world we serve and which serves us in  return  we must be swift and accurate in the part we play in a drama so  mighty  so strenuous  and so complex     more than any of the others  the twentieth century will be democratic  the  greatest discovery of the nineteenth century was that of the reality of  external things  that of the twentieth century will be this axiom in social  geometry   a straight line is the shortest distance between two points   if  something needs doing  do it  the more plainly  directly  honestly  the  better     the earlier centuries cared little for the life of a man  hence they failed  to discriminate  in masses and mobs they needed kings and rulers but could  not choose them  hence the device of selecting as ruler the elder son of  the last ruler  whatever his nature might be  a child  a lunatic  a  monster  a sage   it was all the same to these unheeding centuries  the  people could not follow those they understood or who understood them  they  must trust all to the blind chance of heredity  tyrant or figurehead  the  mob  which from its own indifference creates the pomp of royalty  threw up  its caps for the king  and blindly died for him in his courage or in his  folly with the same unquestioning loyalty  in like manner did the mob  fashion lords and princes  each in its own image  not the man who would do  or think or help  but the eldest son of a former lord was chosen for its  homage  the result of it all was that no use was made of the forces of  nature  for those who might have learned to control them were hunted to  their death  the men who could think and act for themselves were in no  position to give their actions leverage     when a people really means to do something  it must resort to democracy  it  must value men as men  not as functions of a chain of conventionalities    america   says emerson   means opportunity   opportunity for work   opportunity for training  opportunity for influence  democracy exalts the  individual  it realizes that of all the treasures of the nation  the talent  of its individual men is the most important  it realizes that its first  duty is to waste none of this  it cannot afford to leave its miltons mute  and inglorious nor to let its village hampdens waste their strength on  petty obstacles while it has great tasks for them to accomplish  in a  democracy  when work is to be done men rise to do it  no matter what the  origin of our washingtons and lincolns  our grants and our shermans  our  clevelands or our roosevelts  our eliots  our hadleys  or our remsens  we  know that they are being made ready for every crisis which may need their  hand  for every work we would have them carry through  to give each man the  training he deserves is to bring the right man face to face with his own  opportunity  the straight line is the shortest distance between two points  in life as in geometry  for the work of a nation we may not call on lord  this or earl that  whose ancestors have lain on velvet for a thousand  years  we want the man who can do the work  who can face the dragon  or  carry the message to garcia  a man whose nerves are not relaxed by  centuries of luxury will serve us best  give him a fair chance to try  give  us a fair chance to try him  this is the meaning of democracy  not fuss and  feathers  pomp and gold lace  but accomplishment     democracy does not mean equality  just the reverse of this  it means  individual responsibility  equality before the law  of course  equality of  opportunity  but no other equality save that won by faithful service  that  social system which bids men rise must also let them fall if they cannot  maintain themselves  to choose the right man means the dismissal of the  wrong  the weak  the incompetent  the untrained  the dissipated find no  growing welcome in the century which is coming  it will have no place for  unskilled laborers  a bucket of water and a basket of coal will do all that  the unskilled laborer can do if we have skilled men to direct them  the  unskilled laborer is no product of democracy  he exists in spite of  democracy  the children of the republic are entitled to something better  a  generous education  a well directed education  should be the birthright of  each one of them  democracy may even intensify natural inequalities  the  man who cannot say no to cheap and vulgar temptations falls all the lower  in the degree to which he is a free agent  in competition with men alert   loyal  trained and creative  the dullard is condemned to a lifetime of hard  labor  through no direct fault of his own  keep the capable man down and  you may level the incapable one up  but this the twentieth century will not  do  this democracy will not do  this it is not now doing  and this it never  will attempt  the social condition which would give all men equal reward   equal enjoyment  equal responsibility  may be a condition to dream of  it  may be utopia  it is not democracy  sir henry maine describes the process  of civilization as the  movement from status to contract   this is the  movement from mass to man  from subservience to individualism  from  tradition to democracy  from pomp and circumstance of non essentials to the  method of achievement     owen wister in  the virginian  says   all america is divided into two  classes   the quality and the equality  the latter will always recognize  the former when mistaken for it  both will be with us until our women bear  nothing but kings  it was through the declaration of independence that we  americans acknowledged the  eternal inequality  of man  for by it we  abolished a cut and dried aristocracy  we had seen little men artificially  held up in high places  and great men artificially held down in low places   and our own justice loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature   therefore we decreed that every man should  thenceforth have equal liberty  to find his own level  by this very decree we acknowledged and gave freedom  to true aristocracy  saying   let the best man win  whoever he is   let the  best man win  that is america s word  that is true democracy  and true  democracy and true aristocracy are one and the same thing  if anybody  cannot see this  so much the worse for his eyesight       paucis vivat humanum genus    for the few the race should live    this  is the discarded motto of another age  the few live for the many   the clean and strong enrich the life of all with their wisdom  with their  conquests  it is to bring about the larger equalities of opportunity  or  purpose  that we exalt the talents of the few     this has not always been clear  even the history of the republic  my own  great grandfather  john elderkin waldo  said at tolland  connecticut  more  than a century ago   times are hard with us in new england  they will never  be any better until each farm laborer in connecticut is willing to work all  day for a sheep s head and pluck   just as they used to do before the red  schoolhouses on the hills began to preach their doctrines of sedition and  equality  there could never be good times again  so he thought  till the  many again lived for the few     it is in the saving of the few who serve the many that the progress of  civilization lies  in the march of the common man  and in the influence of  the man uncommon who rises freely from the ranks  we have all of history  that counts     in a picture gallery at brussels there is a painting by wiertz  most  cynical of artists  representing the man of the future and the things of  the past  a naturalist holds in his right hand a magnifying glass  and in  the other a handful of napoleon and his marshals  guns  and  battle flags   tiny objects swelling with meaningless glory  he examines  these intensely  while a child at his side looks on in open eyed wonder   she cannot understand what a grown man can find in these curious trifles  that he should take the trouble to study them     this painting is a parable designed to show napoleon s real place in  history  it was painted within a dozen miles of the field of waterloo  and  not many years after the noise of its cannon had died away  it shows the  point of view of the man of the future  save in the degradation of france   through the impoverishment of its life blood  there is little in human  civilization to recall the disastrous incident of napoleon s existence      paucis vivat humanum genus    the many live for the few   this shall  be true no longer  the earth belongs to him who can use it and the only  force which lasts is that which is used to make men free      triumphant america   says george horace lorimer   certainly does not mean  each and every one of our seventy eight millions  for instance  it does not  include the admitted idiots and lunatics  the registered paupers and  parasites  the caged criminals  the six million illiterates  in a sense  it  includes the twenty five to thirty million children  for they exert a  tremendous influence upon the grown people  but in no sense does it include  the whittlers on dry goods boxes  the bar room loafers  the fellows that  listen all day long for the whistle to blow  those who are the first to be  mentioned whenever there is talk of cutting down the force  it does not  include those of our statesmen who spend their time in promoting corrupt  jobs  or in hunting places for lazy heelers  it does not include the  doctors who reach their high water mark for professional knowledge on the  day they graduate  or the lawyers who lie and cheat and procure injustice  for the sake of fees      most of these  even the idiots and criminals  do a little something  towards progress  this world is so happily ordered that it is impossible  for one man to do much harm or to avoid doing some good  and one of the  greatest forces for good is the power of a bad example  still it is not our  bad examples that make us get on and earn us these smothers of flowery  compliment      some of us are tall and others short  some straight and others crooked   some strong  others feeble  some of us run  others walk  others snail it   but all  all have their feet upon the same level of the common earth  and  america s worst enemy is he  or she  who by word or look encourages another  to think otherwise  head as high as you please  but feet always upon the  common ground  never upon anybody s shoulders or neck  even though he be  weak or willing      so in this strenuous and complex age  this age of  fierce democracy   what  have we to do  and with what manner of men shall we work  young men of the  twentieth century  will your times find place for you  there is plenty to  do in every direction  that is plain enough  all the pages in this little  book  or in a very large one  would be filled by a mere enumeration  in  agriculture a whole great empire is yet to be won in the arid west  and the  west that is not arid and the east that was never so must be turned into  one vast market garden  the twentieth century will treat a farm as a  friend  and it will yield rich returns for such friendship  in the  twentieth century vast regions will be fitted to civilization  not by  imperialism  which blasts  but by permeation  which reclaims     the table lands of mexico  the plains of manchuria  the pampas of  argentine  the moors of northern japan  all these regions in our own  temperate zone offer a welcome to the anglo saxon farmer  the great tropics  are less hopeful  but they have never had a fair trial  the northern  nations have tried to exploit them in haste  and then to get away  never to  stay with them and work patiently to find out their best  some day the  possibilities of the torrid zone may come to us as a great discovery     there is need of men in forestry  for we must win back the trees we have  slain with such ruthless hand  the lumberman of the future will pick ripe  trees and save the rest as carefully as the herdsman selects his stock  in  engineering  in mining  in invention  there are endless possibilities   every man who masters what is already known in any one branch of applied  science  makes his own fortune  he who can add a little  save a little  do  something better or something cheaper  makes the fortune of a hundred  others   there is always room for a man of force  and he makes room for  many      andrew carnegie once said that the foundation of his fortune lay in the  employment of trained chemists  while other men made steel by rule of  thumb  trained chemists made better steel  just a little  they devised ways  to make it cheaper  just a little  and they found means to utilize the  slag  all this means hundreds of millions of dollars  if done on a large  enough scale     there is no limit to the demands of engineering  a million waterfalls dash  down the slopes of the sierras  the patient sun has hauled the water up  from the sea and spread it in snow over the mountains  the same sun will  melt the snow  and as the water falls back to the sea it will yield again  the force it cost to bring it to its heights  thus sunshine and falling  water can be transmuted into power  this power already lights the cities of  california  and some day it may be changed into the heat which moves a  thousand factories  all these are the problems of the electrical engineer   equally rich are the opportunities in other forms of engineering  there is  no need to be in haste  perhaps  but the twentieth century is eager in its  quest for gold  the mother lode runs along the foothills from bering  straits to cape horn  from end to end of the continent the twentieth  century will bring this gold to light  and carry it all away  the mining  engineer who knows the mountains best finds his fortune ready to his hand   civil engineers  steam engineers  naval engineers  whoever knows how to  manage things or men  even social engineers  labor engineers  all find an  eager welcome  there are never too many of those who know how  but the day  of the rule of thumb has long since past  the engineer of to day must  create  not imitate  and to him who can create  this last century we call  the twentieth is yet part of the first day of creation     in commerce the field is always open for young men  the world s trade is  barely yet begun  we hear people whining over the spread of the commercial  spirit  but what they mean is not the spirit of commerce  it is persistence  of provincial selfishness  a spirit which has been with us since the fall  of adam  and which the centuries of whitening sails has as yet not  eradicated  the spirit of fair commerce is a noble spirit  through commerce  the world is unified  through commerce grows tolerance  and through  tolerance  peace and solidarity  commerce is world wide barter  each nation  giving what it can best produce for what is best among others  freedom  breeds commerce as commerce demands freedom  only free men can buy and  sell  for without selling no man nor nation has means to buy  when china is  a nation  her people will be no longer a  yellow peril   it is poverty   slavery  misery  which makes men dangerous  in the words of  joss  chinchingoss   the kipling of singapore  we have only to give the chinaman       the chance at home that he makes for himself elsewhere     and the star of the jelly fish nation mid others shall shine as fair      since the day  twenty three years ago  on which i first passed through the  golden gate of california  i have seen the steady increase of the shipping  which enters that channel  there are ten vessels to day passing in and out  to one in       another twenty five years will see a hundred times as many   we have discovered the orient  and even more  the orient has discovered us   we may not rule it by force of arms  for that counts nothing in trade or  civilization  commerce follows the flag only when the flag flies on  merchant ships  it has no interest in following the flag to see a fight   commerce follows fair play and mutual service  through the centuries of war  men have only played at commerce  the twentieth century will take it  seriously  and it will call for men to do its work  it will call more  loudly than war has ever done  but it will ask its men not to die bravely   but to live wisely  and above all truthfully to watch their accounts     the twentieth century will find room for pure science as well as for  applied science and ingenious invention  each helmholtz of the future will  give rise to a thousand edisons  exact knowledge must precede any form of  applications  the reward of pure science will be  in the future as in the  past  of its own kind  not fame nor money  but the joy of finding truth  to  this joy no favor of fortune can add  the student of nature in all the ages  has taken the vow of poverty  to him money  his own or others  means only  the power to do more or better work     the twentieth century will have its share in literature and art  most of  the books it will print will not be literature  for idle books are written  for idle people  and many idle people are left over from less insistent  times  the books sold by the hundred thousands to men and women not trained  to make time count  will be forgotten before the century is half over  the  books it saves will be books of its own kind  plain  straightforward   clear cut  marked by that  fanaticism for veracity  which means everything  else that is good in the intellectual and moral development of man  the  literature of form is giving way already to the literature of power  we  care less and less for the surprises and scintillations of clever fellows   we care more and more for the real thoughts of real men  we find that the  deepest thoughts can be expressed in the simplest language   a straight  line is the shortest distance between two points  in literature as well as  in mechanics   in simplicity is strength   as watt said of machinery  and  it is true in art as well as in mechanics     in medicine  the field of action is growing infinitely broader  now that  its training is securely based on science  and the divining rod no longer  stands first among its implements of precision  not long ago  it is said  a  young medical student in new york committed suicide  leaving behind this  touching sentence   i die because there is room for no more doctors   and  this just now  when for the first time it is worth while to be a doctor   room for no more doctors  no doubt  of the kind to which he belonged  men  who know nothing and care nothing for science and its methods  who choose  the medical school which will turn them loose most quickly and cheaply  who  have no feeling for their patients  and whose prescriptions are given with  no more conscience than goes into the fabrication of an electric belt or  the compounding of a patent medicine  room for no more doctors whose  highest conception is to look wise  take his chances  and pocket the fee   room for no more doctors just now  when the knowledge of human anatomy and  physiology has shown the way to a thousand uses of preventive surgery  room  for no more doctors  when the knowledge of the microbes and their germs has  given the hope of successful warfare against all contagious diseases  room  for no more doctors  when antiseptics and anaesthetics have proved their  value in a thousand pain saving ways  room for no more doctors now  when  the doctor must be an honest man  with a sound knowledge of the human body  and a mastery of the methods of the sciences on which this knowledge  depends  room for no more doctors of the incompetent class  because the  wiser times demand a better service     what is true in medicine applies also to the profession of law  the  pettifogger must give place to the jurist  the law is not a device for  getting around the statutes  it is the science and art of equity  the  lawyers of the future will not be mere pleaders before juries  they will  save their clients from need of judge or jury  in every civilized nation  the lawyers must be the law givers  the sword has given place to the green  bag  the demands of the twentieth century will be that the statutes  coincide with equity  this condition educated lawyers can bring about  to  know equity is to be its defender     in politics the demand for serious service must grow  as we have to do with  wise and clean men  statesmen  instead of vote manipulators  we shall feel  more and more the need for them  we shall demand not only men who can lead  in action  but men who can prevent unwise action  often the policy which  seems most attractive to the majority is full of danger for the future  we  need men who can face popular opinion  and  if need be  to face it down   the best citizen is one not afraid to cast his vote away by voting with the  minority     as we look at it in the rough  the political outlook of democracy often  seems discouraging  a great  rich  busy nation cannot stop to see who grabs  its pennies  we are plundered by the rich  we are robbed by the poor  and  trusts and unions play the tyrant over both  but all these evils are  temporary  the men that have solved greater problems in the past will not  be balked by these  whatever is won for the cause of equity and decency is  never lost again   eternal vigilance is the price of liberty   and in this  twentieth century there are always plenty who are awake  one by one  political reforms take their place on our statute books  and each one comes  to stay     in all this  the journalist of the future may find an honorable place  he  will learn to temper enterprise with justice  audacity with fidelity   omniscience with truthfulness  when he does this he will become a natural  leader of men because he will be their real servant  to mould public  opinion  to furnish a truthful picture of the times from day to day  either  of these ideals in journalism gives ample room for the play of the highest  manly energy     the need of the teacher will not grow less as the century goes on  the  history of the future is written in the schools of to day  and the reform  which gives us better schools is the greatest of reforms  it is said that  the teacher s noblest work is to lead the child to his inheritance  this is  the inheritance he would win  the truth that men have tested in the past   and the means by which they were led to know that it was truth   free  should the scholar be  free and brave   and to such as these the twentieth  century will bring the reward of the scholar     the twentieth century will need its preachers and leaders in religion  some  say  idly  that religion is losing her hold in these strenuous days  but  she is not  she is simply changing her grip  the religion of this century  will be more practical  more real  it will deal with the days of the week  as well as with the sabbath  it will be as patent in the marts of trade as  in the walls of a cathedral  for a man s religion is his working hypothesis  of life  not of life in some future world  but of life right here to day   the only day we have in which to build a life  it will not look backward  exclusively to  a dead fact stranded on the shore of the oblivious years    nor will its rewards be found alone in the life to come  the world of  to day will not be a  vale of tears  through which sinful men are to walk  unhappily toward final reward  it will be a world of light and color and  joy  a world in which each of us may have a noble though a humble  part   the work of the  holy life of action   it will find religion in love  and wisdom and virtue  not in bloodless asceticism  philosophical  disputation  the maintenance of withered creeds  the cultivation of  fruitless emotion  or the recrudescence of forms from which the life has  gone out  it is possible  thoreau tells us  for us to  walk in hallowed  cathedrals   and this in our every day lives of profession or trade  it is  the loyalty to duty  the love of god through the love of men  which may  transform the workshop to a cathedral  and the life of to day may be divine  none the less because it is strenuous and complex  it may be all the more  so because it is democratic  even the sabbath and its duties being no  longer exalted above the other holy days     what sort of men does the century need for all this work it has to do  we  may be sure that it will choose its own  and those who cannot serve it will  be cast aside unpityingly  those it can use it will pay generously  each  after its kind  some with money  some with fame  some with the sense of  power  some with the joy of service  some will work hard in spite of vast  wealth  some only after taking the vow of poverty     those not needed you can find any day  they lean against lamp posts in  platoons  they crowd the saloons  they stand about railway stations all day  long to see trains go by  they dally on the lounges of fashionable clubs   they may be had tied in bundles by the employers of menial labor  their  women work at the wash tubs  and crowd the sweat shops of great cities  or   idle rich  they may dawdle in the various ways in which men and women  dispose of time  yielding nothing in return for it  you  whom the century  wants  belong to none of these classes  yours must be the spirit of the  times  strenuous  complex  democratic     a young man is a mighty reservoir of unused power   give me health and a  day and i will put the pomp of emperors to shame   if i save my strength  and make the most of it  there is scarcely a limit to what i may do  the  right kind of men using their strength rightly  far outrun their own  ambitions  not as to wealth and fame and position  but as to actual  accomplishment   i never dreamed that i should do so much   is the frequent  saying of a successful man  for all men are ready to help him who throws  his whole soul into the service     men of training the century must demand  it is impossible to drop into  greatness   there is always room at the top   so the chicago merchant said  to his son   but the elevator is not running   you must walk up the stairs  on your own feet  it is as easy to do great things as small  if you only  know how  the only way to learn to do great things is to do small things  well  patiently  loyally  if your ambitions run high  it will take a long  time in preparation  there is no hurry  no wise man begrudges any of the  time spent in the preparation for life  so long as it is actually making  ready      profligacy   says emerson   consists not in spending  but in spending off  the line of your career  the crime which bankrupts men and nations is that  of turning aside from one s main purpose to serve a job here and there      the value of the college training of to day cannot be too strongly  emphasized  you cannot save time nor money by omitting it  whatever the  profession on which you enter  the college is becoming a part of life  for  a long time the american college was swayed by the traditions of the  english aristocracy  its purpose was to certify to a man s personal  culture  the young man was sent to college that he might be a member of a  gentler caste  his degree was his badge that in his youth he had done the  proper thing for a gentleman to do  it attested not that he was wise or  good or competent to serve  but that he was bred a gentleman among  gentlemen     so long as the title of academic bachelor had this significance  the man of  action passed it by  it had no meaning to him  and the fine edge of  accuracy in thought and perception  which only the college can give  was  wanting in his work  the college education did not seem to disclose the  secret of power  and the man of affairs would have none of it     a higher ideal came from germany   that of erudition  the german scholar  knows some one thing thoroughly  he may be rude or uncultured  he may not  know how to use his knowledge  but whatever this knowledge is  it is sound  and genuine  thoroughness of knowledge gives the scholar self respect  it  makes possible a broad horizon and clear perspective  from these sources   english and german  the american university is developing its own essential  idea   that of personal effectiveness  the american university of to day  seeks neither culture nor erudition as its final end  it values both as  means to greater ends  it looks forward to work in life  its triumphs in  these regards the century will see clearly  it will value culture and  treasure erudition  but it will use both as helps toward doing things  it  will find its inspiration in the needs of the world as it is  and it is  through such effort that the world that is to be shall be made a reality  a  great work demands full preparation  it takes larger provision for a cruise  to the cape of good hope than for a trip to the isle of dogs  for this  reason the century will ask its men to take a college education     it will ask much more than that   a college education where the work is  done in earnest  students and teachers realizing its serious value  and  besides all this  it will demand the best special training which its best  universities can give  for the twentieth century will not be satisfied with  the universities of the fifteenth or seventeenth centuries  it will create  its own  and the young man who does the century s work will be a product of  its university system  of this we may be sure  the training for strenuous  life is not in academic idleness  the development of living ideals is not  in an atmosphere of cynicism  the blase  lukewarm  fin de siecle young man  of the clubs will not represent university culture  nor  on the other hand   will culture be dominated by a cheap utilitarianism      you will hear every day around you   said emerson to the divinity students  of harvard   the maxims of a low prudence  you will hear that your first  duty is to get land and money  place and fame   what is this truth you  seek  what is this beauty   men will ask in derision  if  nevertheless  god  have called any of you to explain truth and beauty  be bold  be firm  be  true  when you shall say   as others do  so will i  i renounce  i am sorry  for it  my early visions  i must eat the good of the land  and let learning  and romantic speculations go until some more favorable season   then dies  the man in you  then once more perish the buds of art and poetry and  science  as they have died already in a hundred thousand men  the hour of  that choice is the crisis in your history      the age will demand steady headed men  men whose feet stand on the ground   men who can see things as they really are  and act accordingly   the  resolute facing of the world as it is  with all the garments of  make believe thrown off    this  according to huxley  is the sole cure for  the evils which beset men and nations  the only philosophy of life is that  derived from its science  we know right from wrong because the destruction  is plain in human experience  right action brings abundance of life  wrong  action brings narrowness  decay  and degeneration  a man must have  principles of life above all questions of the mere opportunities of to day   but these principles are themselves derived from experience  they belong to  the higher opportunism  the consideration of what is best in the long run   the man who is controlled by an arbitrary system without reference to  conditions  is ineffective  he becomes a crank  a fanatic  a man whose aims  are out of all proportion to results  this is because he is dealing with an  imaginary world  not with the world as it is  we may admire the valiant  knight who displays a noble chivalry in fighting wind mills  but we do not  call on a wind mill warrior when we have some plain  real work to  accomplish  all progress  large or small  is the resultant of many forces   we cannot single out any one of these as of dominant value  and ignore or  despise the others  in moving through the solar system  the earth is  falling toward the sun as well as flying away from it  in human society   egoism is coexistent with altruism  competition with co operation  mutual  struggle with mutual aid  each is as old as the other and each as  important  for the one could not exist without the other  not in air built  utopias  but in flesh and blood  wood and stone and iron  will the movement  of humanity find its realization     don t count on gambling as a means of success  gambling rests on the desire  to get something for nothing  so does burglary and larceny   the love of  money is the root of all evil   this was said long ago  and it is not  exactly what the wise man meant  he was speaking of unearned money  money  is power  and to save up power is thrift  on thrift civilization is  builded  the root of all evil is the desire to get money without earning  it  to get something for nothing demoralizes all effort  the man who gets a  windfall spends his days watching the wind  the man who wins in a lottery  buys more lottery tickets  whoever receives bad money  soon throws good  money after bad  he will throw that of others when his own is gone  no firm  or corporation is rich enough to afford to keep gamblers as clerks     the age will demand men of good taste who care for the best they know   vulgarity is satisfaction with mean things  that is vulgar which is poor of  its kind  there is a kind of music called rag time   vulgar music  with  catchy tunes  catchy to those who do not know nor care for things better   there are men satisfied with rag time music  with rag time theatres  with  rag time politics  rag time knowledge  rag time religion   it was my duty  to have loved the highest   the highest of one man may be low for another   but no one can afford to look downward for his enjoyments  the corrosion of  vulgarity spreads everywhere  its poison enters every home  the billboards  of our cities bear evidence to it  our newspapers reek with it  our story  books are filled with it  we cannot keep it out of our churches or our  colleges  the man who succeeds must shun  vulgarity  to be satisfied with  poor things in one line will tarnish his ideals in the direction of his  best efforts  one great source of failure in life is satisfaction with mean  things  it is easier to be almost right than to be right  it is less trying  to wish than to do  there are many things that glitter as well as gold and  which can be had more cheaply  illusion is always in the market and can be  had on easy terms  realities do not lie on the bargain counters  happiness  is based on reality  it must be earned before we can come into its  possession  happiness is not a state  it is the accompaniment of action  it  comes from the exercise of natural functions  from doing  thinking   planning  fighting  overcoming  loving  it is positive and strengthening   it is the signal  all is well   passed from one nerve cell to another  it  does not burn out as it glows  it makes room for more happiness  loving   too  is a positive word  it is related to happiness as an impulse to  action  the love that does not work itself out in helping acts as mere  torture of the mind  the primal impulse of vice and sin is a short cut to  happiness  it promises pleasure without earning it  and this pleasure is  always an illusion  its final legacy is weakness and pain  pain is not a  punishment  but a warning of harm done to the body  the unearned pleasures  provoke this warning  they leave a  dark brown taste in the mouth   their  recollection is  different in the morning   such pleasures  robert burns  who had tried many of them says  are  like poppies spread   or  like the  snow falls on the river   but it is not true that they pass and leave no  trace  their touch is blasting  but true happiness leaves no reaction  to  do strengthens a man for more doing  to love makes room for more loving     the second power of vulgarity is obscenity  and this vice is like the  pestilence  all inane vulgarity tends to become obscene  from obscenity  rather than drink comes the helplessness of the ordinary tramp     another form of vulgarity is profanity  the habit of swearing is not a mark  of manliness  it is the sign of a dull  coarse  unrefined nature  a lack of  verbal initiative  sometimes  perhaps  profanity seems picturesque and  effective  i have known it so in arizona once or twice  in old mexico and  perhaps in wyoming  but never in the home  or the street  or the ordinary  affairs of life  it is not that blasphemy is offensive to god  he is used  to it  perhaps  for he has met it under many conditions  but it is  offensive to man  insulting to the atmosphere  and destructive of him who  uses it  profanity and bluster are not signs of courage  the bravest men  are quiet of speech and modest in demeanor     the man who is successful will not be a dreamer  he will have but one dream  and that will work itself out as a purpose  dreaming wanes into  sentimentalism  and sentimentalism is fatal to action  the man of purpose  says no to all lesser calls  all minor opportunities  he does not abandon  his college education because a hundred dollar position is offered him  outside  he does not turn from one profession because there is money in  another  he has his claim staked out  and with time he will only fill in  the detail of its boundaries      now that you are through college  what are you going to do   asked a  friend of a wise young man      i shall study medicine   was the grave reply      but isn t that profession already overcrowded   asked the friend      possibly it is   said the youth   but i purpose to study medicine all the  same  those who are already in the profession must take their chances      in this joke of the newspapers there is a sound philosophy  men of purpose  never overcrowd  the crowd is around the foot of the staircase waiting for  the elevator     the old traveller  rafinesque  tells us that when he was a boy he read the  voyages of captain cook  le vaillant  pallas  and bougainville  and  my  soul was fired to be a great traveller like them  and so i became such   he  adds shortly     if you say to yourself   i will be a traveller  a statesman  an engineer    if you never unsay it  if you bend all your powers in that direction  if  you take advantage of all helps that come in your way and reject all that  do not  you will sometime reach your goal  for the world turns aside to let  any man pass who knows whither he is going      why should we call ourselves men   said mirabeau   unless it be to succeed  in everything  everywhere  say of nothing   this is beneath me   nor feel  that anything is beyond your power  for nothing is impossible to the man  who can will      do not say that i am expecting too much of the effects of a firm  resolution  that i give advice which would lead to failure  for the man who  will fail will never take a resolution  those among you whom fate has cut  out to be nobodies are the ones who will never try     even harmless pleasures hurt if they win you from your purpose  lorimer s  old merchant writes to his son at harvard   you will meet fools enough in  the day without hunting up the main herd at night   this plain business  man s advice is worth every young man s attention     the twentieth century will ask for men of instant decision  men whose  mental equipment is all in order  ready to be used on the instant  yes and  no  right and wrong  we must have them labelled and ready to pack to go  anywhere  to do anything at any time  or to know why we refuse to do it  if  it is something we will not do  ethelred the unready died helpless a  thousand years ago  the unready are still with us  but the strenuous  century will grant them but short shrift     the man of the twentieth century will be a hopeful man  he will love the  world and the world will love him   there is no hope for you   thoreau once  said   unless this bit of sod under your feet is the sweetest for you in  the world  in any world   the effective man takes his reward as he goes  along  nowhere is the sky so blue  the grass so green  the opportunities so  choice as now  here  to day  the time  the place where his work must be  done      to day is your day and mine   i have said on another occasion   the only  day we have  the day in which we play our part  what our part may signify  in the great whole we may not understand  but we are here to play it  and  now is the time  this we know  it is a part of action  not of whining  it  is a part of love  not cynicism  it is for us to express love in terms of  human helpfulness      whatever feeling is worthy and real will express itself in action  and the  glow that surrounds worthy action we call happiness     he will be a loyal man  considering always the best interests of him he  serves  ready to lay down his life  if need be  for duty  ready to abandon  whatever conflicts with higher loyalty  with higher duty     in the economic struggles of to day  well meaning men are making two huge  mistakes  which in time will undo whatever of good their efforts may  accomplish  one of these is the struggle against education  the effort to  limit the number of skilled laborers  and this in a free country where each  man s birthright is the development of his skill  the other is the effort  to destroy the feeling of personal loyalty on the part of the laborer  half  the value of any man s service lies in his willingness  his devotion to the  man or the work  this old fashioned virtue of loyalty must not be  cheapened  the man whose service is worth paying for  gives more than his  labor  he believes that what he does is right  and when anything goes wrong  he will turn in and make it right  in the long run the laborer can get no  more than he deserves  and disloyal labor is paving the way for its own  subjugation  unwilling service is a form of slavery  and unwilling  employment is a slavery of the employer     more than all this  the man in the twentieth century needs must be a man of  character  it was said of abraham lincoln that he was a man  too simply  great to scheme for his proper self   the man who schemes for his own  advancement soon forfeits the support of others  he may lay pipes and pull  wires  seeming for a little to succeed   god consents  but only for a  time   sooner or later  if he lives to meet his fate  he finds his end in  utter failure  and this failure is final  for those who have suffered will  not help him again  even rats desert a sinking ship  to be successful a man  need take no heed for his own particular future  he will find his place in  the future of his work     in the ordinary business of life the smart man has had his day  he gives  place to the man who can bring about results  whatever the present menace  of trust and monopoly  the business of the future must be conducted on  large lines  the profits of the future will be the legitimate reward of  economy  organization  and boldness of conception  to this end absolute  honesty is essential to success  the merchant selling poor goods at high  prices  an article which looks as good as the real thing but is something  else  must give place to a larger system  with specialized service on a  basis of absolute truthfulness  business of a large scale must finally  demand publicity and equity  sooner or later even monopolies must grant  this  whether we insist on it by statute or not  it is necessary for their  own protection  for large structures cannot long stand on insecure  foundations  in the long run trade is honest  for dishonest trade cuts its  own throat     above all  because including all  the century will ask for men of sober  mind  the finest piece of mechanism in all the universe is the brain of man  and the mind which is its manifestation  what mind is  or how it is related  to brain cells  we cannot say  but this we know  that as the brain is  so  is the mind  whatever injury comes to the one is shown in the other  in  this complex structure  with its millions of connecting cells  we are able  to form images of the external world  truthful so far as they go  to retain  these images  to compare them  to infer relations of cause and effect  to  induce thought from sensation  and to translate thought into action  in  proportion to the exactness of these operations is the soundness  the  effectiveness of the man  the man is the mind  and everything else is  accessory  the sober man is the one who protects his brain from all that  would do it harm  vice is our name for self inflicted injury  and the  purpose of vice is to secure a temporary feeling of pleasure through injury  to the brain  real happiness does not come through vice  you will know that  which is genuine because it makes room for more happiness  the pleasures of  vice are mere illusions  tricks of the nervous system  and each time these  tricks are played it is more and more difficult for the mind to tell the  truth  such deceptions come through drunkenness and narcotism  in greater  or less degree all nerve affecting drugs produce it  alcohol  nicotine   caffeine  opium  cocaine  and the rest  strong or weak  habitual use of any  of these is a physical vice  a physical vice becomes a moral vice  and all  vice leaves its record on the nervous system  to cultivate vice is to  render the actual machinery of our mind incapable of normal action     it is the brain s business to perceive  to think  to will  to act  all  these functions taken together we call the mind  the brain is hidden in  darkness  sheltered within a box of bone  all that it knows comes to it  from the nerves of sense  all that it can do in this world is to act on the  muscles it controls through its nerves of motion  the final purpose of  knowledge is action  our senses tell us what lies about us  that we may  move and act  and do this wisely and safely  the sense organs are the  brain s only teachers so far as we know  the muscles are its only servants   but there are many orders which may be issued to these servants  out of the  many sensations  memories  imaginations  how shall the brain choose     the power of attention fixes the mind on those sensations or impressions of  most worth  pushing the others into the background  past impressions   memory pictures  linger in the brain  and these  bidden or unbidden  crowd  with the others  to know the relation of all these  to distinguish present  impressions from memories  realities from dreams   this is mental sanity   the sane brain performs its appointed task  the mind is clear  the will is  strong  the attention persistent  and all is well in the world  but the  machinery of the brain may fail  the mind grows confused  it mistakes  memories for realities  it loses the power of attention  a fixed idea may  take possession of it  or it may be filled by a thousand vagrant  impressions  wandering memories  in as many seconds  in this case the  response of the muscles becomes uncertain  the acts are governed not by the  demands of external conditions but by internal whims  this is a condition  of mania or mental irresponsibility  some phase of mental unsoundness is  produced by any of the drugs which affect the nerves  whether stimulants or  narcotics  they may help to borrow from our future store of energy  but  they borrow at compound interest and never repay the loan  they give an  impression of joy  of rest  of activity  without giving the fact  one and  all  their function is to force the nervous system to lie  each indulgence  in any of them makes it harder to tell the truth  one and all  their  supposed pleasures are followed by reactions  subjective pains as unreal as  the joys which they follow  each of them  if used persistently  brings  incapacity  insanity  and death  with each of them use creates appetite  to  yield once it is easier to yield again  the harm of some of them is slight   tea  coffee  beer  claret  in moderate quantities  do but moderate harm   but all of them are without other effect on the nerves save to work them  injury  white lies at the best are falsehoods  these are the white lies of  physiology  in regard to each of these  the young man must count the cost   count all the cost and be prepared to pay  the song of ulrich von huetten   when he gave his life for religious freedom  is worth applying to all other  costly things  he sang           ich habe gewagt mit sinnen    und trage des noch kein reu          with open eyes have i dared it     and cherish no regret      for all indulgence in wine and coffee and tobacco you will have a bill to  pay  perhaps not a heavy bill  the indulgence may be worth the while  but  if so  find out for yourself beforehand whether others have found it so  if  you dare  dare with open eyes and cherish no regrets  for regret is the  most profitless thing to cherish  there is nothing more distressing than  remorse without will  the only hope in the world is to stop  and by the  time that the inebriate comes to realize where he is  it is too late to  stop      there is joy in life   says sullivan  the pugilist   but it is known only  to the man who has a few jolts of liquor under his belt   to know this kind  of joy is to put one s self beyond the reach of all others     the joy of the blue sky  the bright sunshine  the rushing torrent  the  songs of birds   sweet as children s prattle is   the breath of the  meadows  the glow of effort  the beauty of poetry  the achievement of  thought  the thousand and thousand real pleasures of life  are inaccessible  to him  who has a few jolts of liquor under his belt   while the sorrows he  feels  or thinks he feels  are as unreal as his joys  and as unworthy of a  life worth living     there was once  i am told  a man who came into his office smacking his  lips  and said to his clerk   the world looks very different to the man who  has had a good glass of brandy and soda in the morning    yes   said the  clerk   and the man looks different to the world      and this is natural and inevitable  for the pleasure  which exists only in  the imagination  leads to action which has likewise nothing to do with the  demands of life  the mind is confused  and may be delighted with the  confusion  but the confused muscles tremble and halt  the tongue is  loosened and utters unfinished sentences  the hand is loosened and the  handwriting is shaky  the muscles of the eyes are unharnessed  and the two  eyes move independently and see double  the legs are loosened  and the  confusion of the brain shows itself in the confused walk  and if this  confusion is long continued  the mental deterioration shows itself in  external things   the shabby hat and seedy clothing  and the gradual drop  of the man from stratum to stratum of society  till he brings up some night  in the ditch  as the world looks more and more different to him  so does he  look more and more different to the world     a prominent lawyer of boston once told me that the great impulse to total  abstinence came to him when a young man  from hearing his fellow lawyers  talking over their cups  the most vital secrets of their clients  business  were made public property when their tongues were loosened by wine  and  this led him to the firm resolution that nothing should go into his mouth  which would prevent him from keeping it closed unless he wanted to open it   the time will come when the only opening for the ambitious man of  intemperate habits will be in politics  it is rapidly becoming so now   private employers dare not trust their business to the man who drinks  the  great corporations dare not  he is not wanted on the railroads  the  steamship lines have long since cast him off  the banks dare not use him   he cannot keep accounts  only the people  long suffering and generous   remain as his resource  for this reason municipal government is his  specialty  and while this patience of the people lasts  our cities will  breed scandals as naturally as our swamps breed malaria  already the  business of the century recognizes the truth of all this  the bonding  companies ask  before they sign a contract  whether the official in  question uses liquor  what kind of liquor  whether he smokes  gambles  or  in other ways so conducts himself that in five years he will be less of a  man than he is now     the great corporations ask the same questions as to all their employees   even these organizations called  soulless  know the value of men  and that  the vices of to day must be reckoned at compound interest and charged  against their estimate of the young man s future  the twentieth century  must be temperate  for only sober men can bear the strain of its  enterprises     equally dangerous is the search for the joys of love by those who would  shirk all love s responsibilities  just as honest love is the most powerful  influence that can enter into a man s life  so is love s counterfeit the  most disintegrating  happiness cannot spring from the ashes of lust  love  looks toward the future  its glory is its altruism  to shirk responsibility  is to destroy the home  the equal marriage demands equal purity of heart   equal chastity of intention  open vice brings with certainty disease and  degradation  secret lust comes to the same end  but all the more surely  because the folly of lying is added to other sources of decay  that society  is so severe in its condemnation of  the double life  is an expression of  the bitterness of its experience  the real character of a man is measured  by the truth he shows to women  his ideal of womankind is gauged by the  character of the woman he seeks     in general  the sinner is not the man who sets out in life to be wicked   few men are born wicked  many are born weak  false ideas of manliness   false conceptions of good fellowship  which false ideas of the relationship  of men and women give  wreck many a young man of otherwise good intentions   the sinner is the man who cannot say no  the fall through vice to sin is a  matter of slow

been too long  a good fellow among the boys  it asks him to surrender three things in  succession  his trust in man  his faith in woman  then the hopes and  ambitions of his childhood  when these are

america is now wasted in dissipation  gross or  petty  in drink or smoke  this strength would be saved could we remember  training rules  through the training rules of our fathers we have come to  consider as part of our inheritance the puritan conscience  as the success  of our nation is built upon this conscience  so in like fashion depends  upon it the success of our daily life     i had a friend once  a mining man of some education  who made his fortune  in bonanza days in nevada  and who drank up what he had made with the boys  who have long since passed away  as a hopeless sot he visited the gold cure  at los gatos  not finding much relief  he walked over to palo alto to  borrow of me his fare to san francisco  he said that he was going to pawn  his goods for a fare to nevada  where he meant to kill himself  whether he  did so or not  i do not know  for ten years have gone by and i have never  heard of him again     as he sat in my room  haggard  bloodshot  ragged  gin flavored  a little  boy who had then never known sin  came in  and being no respecter of  persons  took him for a man and offered him his hand     being taken for a man  brought him back his manhood for a moment  the  visions of evil left him  and from dickens  poem of  the children  he  repeated almost to himself these words           i know now how jesus could liken the kingdom of god to a child       the old scene came back to him  when the master was teaching  the children  crowded about him  and there were those who would send them away  but the  master said   no  let the little children come unto me  and do not forbid  them  for of such is the kingdom of heaven   and again he said   the  kingdom of heaven is within you   and again those whose services the lord  of the centuries could use  he likened to little children     and of the many ways in which this likeness can be used this is one  the  child is born with brain and nervous system adequate to its many purposes  in life  if it is suffered to grow naturally  to become what god meant it  to be  there are not many children of sin not made so by vice   intemperance  lust  and obscenity  they are victims of their elders  folly   of our carelessness as to their environment  half the troubles of men of  our race come through self inflicted injury to the nervous system  we are  tormented by the  fool killer   if we could revert to the child s simple  purity  the free movement of its machinery of life  we should find  ourselves in a new heaven on a new earth  we could understand for ourselves  part of what the master meant  we should know now how jesus could liken the  kingdom of god to a child     all forms of subjective enjoyment  all pleasures that begin and end with  self  unrelated to external things  are insane and unwholesome  destructive  alike to rational enjoyment and to effectiveness in life  and this is true  of spurious emotions alike  whether the pious ecstasies of a half starved  monk  the neurotic imaginings of a sentimental woman  or the riots of a  debauchee  he is the wise man who for all his life can keep mind and soul  and body clean      i know of no more encouraging fact   says thoreau   than the ability of a  man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor  it is something to paint a  particular picture  or to carve a statue  and so make a few objects  beautiful  it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere  and medium through which we look  this morally we can do      if it were ever my fortune in speaking to young men to become eloquent   with the only real eloquence there is  the plain speaking of a living  truth  this i would say       your first duty in life is toward your after self  so live that your  after self  the man you ought to be  may in his time be possible and  actual  far away in the twenties  the thirties  of the twentieth century he  is awaiting his turn  his body  his brain  his soul are in your boyish  hands  he cannot help himself  what will you leave for him  will it be a  brain unspoiled by lust or dissipation  a mind trained to think and act  a  nervous system true as a dial in its response to the truth about you  will  you  boy of the twentieth century  let him come as a man among men in his  time  or will you throw away his inheritance before he has had the chance  to touch it  will you turn over to him a brain distorted  a mind diseased   a will untrained to action  a spinal cord grown through and through with  the devil grass of that vile harvest we call wild oats  will you let him  come  taking your place  gaining through your experiences  hallowed through  your joys  building on them his own  or will you fling his hope away   decreeing wanton like that the man you might have been shall never be     this is your problem in life  the problem of more importance to you than  any or all others  how will you solve it  will you meet it as a man or as a  fool  when you

brown tells us of the old physician showing the physical effects  of vice in the museum of pathology   almighty god writes a very plain  hand   this is what he said  in every failure as in every success in the  twentieth century  this plain hand can be plainly traced   by their long  memories the gods are known   this is an older form of the very same great  lesson  the  goodness and severity of god      those who control the spiritual thought of the twentieth century will be  religious men  they will not be religious in the fashion of monks   ascetics  mystic dreamers  or emotional enthusiasts  they will not be  active in debating societies  discussing the intricacies of creeds  neither  will they be sticklers as to details in religious millinery  they will be  simple  earnest  god fearing  because they have known the god that makes  for righteousness  their religion of the twentieth century will be its  working theory of life  it will be expressed in simple terms or it may not  be expressed at all  but it will be deep graven in the heart  in wise and  helpful life it will find ample justification  it will deal with the world  as it is in the service of  the god of things as they are   it will find  this world not  a vale of tears   a sink of iniquity  but a working  paradise in which the rewards of right doing are instant and constant  it  will find indeed that  his service is perfect freedom   for all things  large or small within the reach of human effort are done in his way and in  his way only     whittier tells us of the story of the day in connecticut in       when the  horror of great darkness came over the land  and all men feared the dreaded  day of judgment had come at last     the legislature of connecticut   dim as ghosts  in the old state house   wished to adjourn to put themselves in condition for the great assizes   meanwhile  abraham davenport  representative from stamford rose to  say          this may well be    the day of judgment for which the world awaits     but be it so or not  i only know    my present duty and my lord s command    to occupy till he come     so at the post where he hath set me in his providence     i choose for one to meet him face to face     let god do his work  we will see to ours      then he took up a discussion of an act relating to the fisheries of alewife  and shad  speaking to men who felt them obliged to stand by their duty   though never expecting to see shad  or alewife  or even connecticut again        glad did i live and gladly die     and i lay me down with a will      this was stevenson s word   let god do his work  we will see to ours   and  in whatever part of god s kingdom we men of the twentieth century may find  ourselves  we shall know that we are at home  for the same hand that made  the world and the ages created also the men in whose hands the final  outcome of the wayward centuries finds its place within the kingdom of  heaven                       the  season of the year  might be presumed to be somewhat genial  yet it  was raw and gusty  and as the pedestrian was without an overcoat  the  uncomfortable and antagonistic shrug of his shoulders  as the chill   fitful blast swept past him  was quite discernible to any eye that  happened to catch his figure at the period  soon  however  he left  the bridge and river behind him  and  stepping on terra firma  turned  hastily down one of the unpretending streets of the town  and entered a  restaurant  out of the drinking saloon of which  several narrow passages  led to small convivial apartments  or rather compartments  in which the  landlord  or  mine host  professed to work culinary miracles  of every  possible shade  in the interest of his patrons  the establishment   although not the most fashionable in the place  was still regarded  as respectable  and was  consequently  the frequent resort of many  well to do tradesmen  and others  who  after the cares of the day had  been laid by  generally repaired thither to slake their thirst with a  flowing tankard  or indulge in  a stew   a quiet game of billiards or  a cigar  as the case might be  from the description of the various  pictures which adorned or decorated the bar room  the nationality of the  proprietor was easily discerned  just over a goodly and shining away of  handsome mirrors that  inside the counter  reflected a maze of graceful  bottles  cut glass and various ornaments appropriate to the profession   hung a large map of ireland  very beautifully gotten up  while on either  side of it  a neat  gilt frame  enclosing a most excellent likeness of  daniel o connell and robert emmet  respectively  harmonized in every  relation with the map itself  around the walls of the room  and  throughout the whole establishment  kindred prints and paintings were  somewhat profusely scattered  presenting unmistakable evidences  that  the proprietor hailed from the emerald isle  and had no inclination   whatever  to disguise the fact from either his customers or the world     at the period that the soldier entered the premises  there were some  half dozen persons seated in the bar  each discussing his favorite  beverage or enjoying his peculiar  weed   among these there was one  individual  however  whose appearance was singularly striking  and who  was taking part in the general conversation with an easy flippancy  and keenness of observation that showed he was a person of no ordinary  information or experience  there was something about him  nevertheless   that  notwithstanding all his efforts to be attractive  was strangely  repellent  his small  grey eyes  thin  blue lips and hooked nose  gave  an expression to his countenance which was far from prepossessing  while  his soft  low  purring chuckle of a laugh  whenever he made a point  in his favor through some facile observation that interfered with the  deductions of those around him  evoked the idea  that he was some huge   human mouser that was congratulating himself on having disposed of some  unfortunate and unsuspecting canary  he was  withal  shapely  and had  an air of refinement about him  the most decided  and  quite beyond the  ordinary run of saloon habitues  his complexion though somewhat dark and  out of keeping with the color of his eyes  was yet pure  while his teeth  were remarkably white and brilliant  and apparently as sharp as lancets   in height he was about five feet ten inches  and in age  somewhere in  the vicinity of thirty  he was dressed in plain gray clothes  and   from all one might gather from his external appearance  was a person in  comfortable circumstances  he was unknown not only to  mine host   but  to every one present  having  as he informed them in the ordinary flow  of conversation  but just arrived in town  where he had business to  transact which might detain him for a few days  or possibly longer  this  information had been volunteered before the arrival of the soldier   so that when the latter had taken his seat  he was literally a greater  stranger as to the name or intentions of the hook nosed gentleman than  any one present  the former having been communicated to the landlord  as philip greaves  and the latter  as already intimated  quite freely  disclosed during the natural flow of the conversation in which he had  taken and still took part     perhaps there were no two beings on earth so dissimilar in every  relation  as were he and the red coat who now ensconsed himself in one  of the chairs  and accepted the invitation to take a friendly glass with  the stranger  he  humble as the rank he bore in the service  was a young  man of most prepossessing appearance and excellent address  his figure   although slight  was beautifully symmetrical and finely knit  in stature  he was about five feet eleven inches  and was apparently as agile as a  leopard  the whole volume of his heart was laid open in his broad  manly  brow and clear dark eyes  and his laughter rang out now and then  at  the brilliant wit or searching sarcasm of his neighbor  in such pure and  joyous tones  as to be infectious even amongst those who were paying  but little attention to what had provoked it  he could not have numbered  more than twenty five or twenty six summers  and it was almost painful   in the presence of such manly beauty and so light a heart  to dwell  on the fact  that the possessor of both  was in absolute slavery  how  carelessly soever he wore his shackles  while both these individuals  differed the one from the other to the extent already mentioned  the  proprietor of the saloon  in turn  presented an appearance as dissimilar  to that of either of his customers as did that of the one to the other   he was a man of herculean proportions  and blessed with as commonplace  features as you could find in a day s walk  every fibre of his frame  bespoke the most gigantic strength  while his full  round face glowed  with the most refreshing health  and presented at the same time as  stolid an expression as could well be imagined in connection with his  vocation  still  there was something in his keen  gray eye and about his  mouth  that bid you beware of taking the book by the cover  while an odd  word of the conversation that now and then reached his ear  called up a  strange expression of intelligence which swept across his features  with the speed of light  and then left them as quiescent and apparently  unintellectual as before  this individual whom we shall name thomas  o brien  or big tom  as his friends were wont to call him  although  never regarded as being over brilliant  there were those who averred  that he not only possessed a fund of good  common sense  but who  stated further  that he was a man of great influence not only among the  soldiers in the fort  but among many of his countrymen both in town and  out of it  tom spoke very slowly and always in an oracular manner  nor  were his movements behind his bar of a very demonstrative character   as no press of custom  whatever  seemed to possess the power of  accelerating his motions or inducing him to exceed the steady formula  that he appeared to have adopted in relation to serving his customers   still he possessed the jewel of honesty and urbanity as an offset to  all this  and  like most large men  was  on the whole  of a kind and  excellent temper  when seen standing by the river or in any elevated  position  he conveyed the idea of a sort of human lighthouse  or a  chimney on fire  so fiercely red was the tremendous shock of hair that  covered his towering head  he was still a young man  and  like the  soldier  unmarried  although the heart of the latter had gone forth and  was in the safe keeping of a charming young cousin of  mine host   who  had emigrated to america some time previously  and who now resided with  her friends in the city of buffalo  tom had preceded his relatives by  some years  and had sojourned  up to the period of their landing  in  the united states also  but taking a sudden notion  as it would seem   he pulled up his stakes  and  like other adventurers  settled down   apparently haphazard  in the town in which he now lived  and where he  had already been upwards of two years  having bought out the  sign of  the harp   as we shall call it  with all its appointments  from another  son of the sod  who had made up his mind to go west     before the soldier  whom we shall name nicholas  or nick barry  had  finished his glass  greaves entered into conversation with him in  relation to the strength of the fort  and the nationality of the  regiment that garrisoned it  observing  at the same time  that  of  course  as usual  a fair sprinkling from the emerald isle was to be  found among them      yes   said barry   go where you may throughout the empire  and whenever  you meet a red coat you will be right in four cases out of six in  putting it down as belonging to an irishman  that is  provided its  precise color and texture are like mine  but you would not be so safe  in applying the same rule wherever you chanced to encounter the clear   bright flash of the genuine scarlet       and why   returned greaves  with an inquiring air which seemed to  be quite at sea upon the subject  although up to that moment  his  conversation was such as to lead one to infer that he could scarcely be  in the dark upon a subject so generally understood      because   said nick   the irish are only fit to do the fighting  and  that s always done  you know  by the rank and file      this reply  although not over satisfactory to the interrogator  seemed  to afford infinite amusement to big tom  who  with a perfect sledge  hammer of a laugh  exclaimed when barry had finished      well done nick  and the divil a betther could it be said if i said it  myself      this unusual and lively demonstration on the part of o brien  seemed  to attract the notice of greaves  who  with the utmost good humor   observed  while glancing in the direction of the bar      from ireland  too  i ll bet my head       seven miles out of it   returned tom with a slight twinkle of his eye    and  of coorse  a gintleman so larned as you will be able to tell where  that is       well  for the life of me   observed greaves   i cannot divine what you  are at  with your  seven miles out   but as i m an englishman  i suppose  that accounts for it       he means by what he has said   interrupted barry   that he is from  connaught  which  for some reason or other  is regarded as seven miles  out of ireland       for some raison or other did you say   returned tom   faith and its  raison enough there is for that same  for it was to connaught that  cromwell and the rest of the blaggards banished or confined the irish  hayros that gave the sassenach such throuble in oulden times  and that s  the raison  you know  that the sayin   to h  l or connaught   first  got a futtin in the world  and that connaught is regarded as bein seven  miles out  by the people who know the ins and outs of it      this was delivered in a quiet  oracular manner from which there was  no appeal  so the conversation continued to flow in a kindred  channel  barry observing that the regiments then stationed in canada  were largely  adulterated   as he humorously termed it  with the irish  element  which  during such times of commotion  was considered by  england safer abroad than at home      how is that   said greaves  casting a searching glance towards the  speaker   i should fancy that the british soldier was safe  and true to  the crown whether at home or abroad  although i am free to confess  that  the irish  as a nation  have much to complain of       and how can you separate the man from the nation  and if a people are  oppressed and wronged as a whole  are they not oppressed and wronged  individually   replied o brien      the inference is reasonable   returned the other   but as england seems  sensible that something ought to be done for the amelioration of the  condition of ireland no doubt the two nations will soon settle down in  the bonds of amity and love  and  in a better state of things  forget  all their bickerings and heartburnings       there was a payriod   retorted tom   when england could have done  somethin to appase ireland  but that payriod is past and gone forever   durin the airly days of o connell  the repale of the union and the  abolition of the church establishment would have worked merricles  these  measures would have done away with absenteeism  an unjust and gallin  taxation  and would have given ireland the conthrol  in some degree at  laste  of her own local affairs  if the act of      previntin england  from intherfarin in any degree in those affairs was revived  it would  have given the irish a chance to build up their manufactures and recruit  their ruined thrade and commerce  it would have recalled the landlord to  his estates  from forrin parts  and re inthroduced a native parliament  that understood the wants and wishes of the people  and that was  intherested in carryin them out  and givin the masses an opportunity of  developin their resources and turnin their soil to account  that is  acre for acre more fertile than that of england  to day  it would have  gathered home from the four winds of the earth the scatthered wealth  that has followed the absentee to distant lands and made dublin and cork  and every city in the counthry alive with min and wimmin  that were able  to pathronise irish manufactures  aye  and pay for them too  all this it  would have done and a thousand times more  but as i have already said   the chance has been thrown away by england  never to be recovered by  her durin  secula seculorum   for now the light of american freedom  has fallen upon ireland  and  pointed out what ought to be her thrue  standin  and the insufficiency of what she once would have been  satisfied with  in the broad effulgence of its glory  the people of  ireland now persave that so if long as they attached any importance to  the mere accident of birth  or bent the knee to hereditary monarchy   they were but walking in the valley and shadow of death  the great moral  spectacle of american freedom built upon the broad and imperishable  basis of the voluntary and intelligent consint of a whole people  has so  upset their household gods and desthroyed the prestige of kingcraft  in their eyes  that they now look forward to the total overthrow of  monarchical institutions in their midst  and the establishment  on their  shores  of a republic in every particular the counterpart of that which  now commands the admiration of the world  across the lines there  and  which is gradually sappin the foundation of british rule on this side of  the lakes  as well as litherally swallowin us up unknownst to ourselves   this is how the case stands now  so that we can aisily persave  that  england has lost the power and opportunity of conciliatin the irish  race  bekase they have no longer a feelin or sintiment in common with  her      these observations  which were made with a degree of ease and eloquence  regarded as totally foreign to tom  actually electrified his hearers   and drew a compliment from greaves  while barry  who knew a good deal  of him  was so astonished at his sudden and earnest volubility  he could  not resist the temptation of assuring him that he was an honor to  his country  if not to humanity at large  the other three or four  individuals present joined in the sentiment  so that  for the time  being  o brien was no ordinary personage in their minds  while a quiet  wink from one to the other seemed to place it beyond a shadow of doubt   that  in their estimation  big tom knew more than he ever got credit  for     when the conversation again began to flow freely  the gentleman  with  the hooked nose  turned it imperceptibly upon fenianism  and the rumored  intention of the organization  in the united states  to make a descent  upon canada at no distant day  at this point  o brien put in a word  or two  to the effect  that he was not so sure of the propriety of the  brotherhood invading the province  as its inhabitants were not in any  way answerable for the wrongs which had been inflicted by england upon  ireland  here barry observed  that although he was not competent to  speak on the matter  and had no desire to endorse or countenance such an  invasion  he regarded a fenian attack upon canada fully as justifiable  as an assault of the same character upon england  or any other portion  of her majesty s dominions  the empire  he contended  was a unit and  no part of it could be assailed  that did not possess  in relation to  ireland  just as inoffensive people as the canadians were  fenianism   he presumed  did not pretend to make war upon individuals  but upon a  government  in any or all of its ramifications  that was alleged to be  oppressive and an enemy to civil and religious freedom  and so long as  any people chose to endorse the acts of such a government by defending  them  and adhering to the flag under which they were said to have been  committed  so long were they amenable to the party who assumed to be  aggrieved in the premises  as aiders and abettors of the offence     this position was so reasonable and so logical that there was but little  room for dispute upon the subject  and hence the absurdity of certain  squeamish gentlemen who  before and since the invasion of       have  denounced a descent upon canada as not so justifiable as an attack upon  the more central parts of the empire  from the assumed fact  that the  canadians are in no way chargeable with the wrongs inflicted by the  british government upon ireland  such an argument to a military man  or  astute politician  would be the very height of absurdity  the outworks  are always stormed and taken before the citadel falls  nor are those  who occupy or defend them regarded with any personal ill feeling by  the assailing party  and are only enemies in so far as they choose to  espouse the cause and defend  at the point of the sword  the acts and  existence of a government held to be corrupt and oppressive  from the  difference in population and other circumstances  there are a greater  number of inoffensive persons in england  in relation to irish  grievances  than there are in canada  so that  adopting the very style  of argument used by those gingerly or subsidized cavillers  there are  more causes for justifying a descent  at any time  upon the latter  than upon the former country  the truth is  the masses or people of any  country are  for the most part  inoffensive on the whole  and are merely  wielded by governments with a view to maintaining a power for good or  evil  having in many cases themselves no very clear idea of the grounds  upon which the field may have been taken  and laying down their arms  at a moment s notice  without being concerned as to the expediency  or justice of a cessation of hostilities  in truth  even amid armies  thundering down upon each other at the word of command  there are  necessarily thousands of unoffending persons who entertain not a single  feeling of animosity against their opponents individually  and who are  but simply the exponents of an idea that their rulers deem necessary to  maintain at the point of the bayonet  although they themselves may not  sympathize with it to any extent whatever  so that it is apparent  that  the invasion of canada was never undertaken with a view to despoiling or  injuring the people  per se  of that country  but for the simple purpose  of making a descent upon a point of the british empire most accessible  to the arms of the republic of ireland on this continent  in the hope  of establishing a basis that would enable irish nationalists to operate  successfully against a government that had for seven hundred years  subjected their country  name and race  to every injustice and  persecution known to the history of crime  such are the contingencies  of war  that the innocent are dragged into the vortex by the guilty   and that those who choose to adopt a flag and are found armed in its  defence  are constructively the enemies of the invaders  and according  to the usages of all nations amenable in the field for the conduct of  their rulers  whatever may be said to the contrary  then  by english  sympathizers or weak kneed patriots  so long as canada is a portion of  the british empire  so long is she a legitimate point of attack for the  enemies of that empire  and no description of special pleading can make  it otherwise  and here we would advise the people of the new dominion to  look into this matter and weigh the consequences of being influenced  by any seeming or real hostile attitude to the government of the united  states  or the mighty hosts which are now gathering in battle array in  the cause of irish freedom  england is fallen  her power and prestige  are gone forever  the star of irish liberty has already emerged from the  clouds that have so long lain piled up along the horizon of the land of  the enslaved celt  and no power on earth can obscure its growing  lustre  until it blazes forth in the full meridian  splendor of irish  nationality and independence  let our neighbors  therefore  we say  not  be betrayed into raising a puny arm against the tremendous force  that cannot fail to be exerted ere long in this connection  or their  redemption from the british yoke and their consequent absorption by the  great american commonwealth may be reddened with more blood than the  circumstances of the case really require     when barry had finished his few observations on this topic  greaves   in further pursuance of the subject  and with the apparent view of  gathering the tone of canadian opinion upon it  observed  that if all  the irish population of the provinces were as true to the sentiment of  the independence of their country  as o brien and his military friend   there might be some reason for apprehending that the intended invasion  of the canadas by the fenian organization of the united states  would  tend to more alarming results to england than were anticipated by the  friends of that country  remarking  in addition  that the irish element  must be very large in her majesty s canadian possessions  if one might  judge from the recent st  patrick s day demonstration throughout them   and the various st  patrick s societies to be found scattered from one  end of the colony to the other  all of which were  no doubt  more or  less tinged with opinions and aspirations similar to those held by the  two individuals who had just spoken      oh  yes   rejoined big tom   there are st  patrick societies in  abundance  but let me inform you  that instead of bein national  associations  as they purport to be  they are the very sthrongholds of  england in this country  and  with scarce an exception  the deadliest  opponents to the very indepindence that we have benn jist spakin about   for the most part  they are filled chock full of a pack of miserable  toadies to the governmint  which manages to gather into them a pack of  rottin  ladin irishmin who can make speeches  dhrink  the day and all  who honor it   sing  god save the queen   and talk english blatherskite  about the glory of the impire  the army and navy  and everythin else in  the world save and except the wrongs of poor  ould ireland  and the way  to redhress them  why  sir  barrin a word dhropped here and there  you d  think it was in an orange lodge you were  if you happened to step in on  one of those societies while engaged in celebrating  as they call it   the anniversary of their pathron saint  for it s nothin you d hear but   rule britannia    the red  white and blue   and kindhered sintiments   and if a chap did happen to give  the harp that wanst   why  its the  sweet  soft air they d be admirin  and the poethry of tom moore  rather  than the low wail for vingeance that was smothered in the heart of the  song itself  what could you expect from sich a st patrick s society as  that of toronto  with a gintleman at its head with the freedom of an  english city in his breeches pocket  and a desire to emulate english  statesmen and english institutions in his heart  look  also  at the able  and larned irishman who stands at the head of the university of that  same methropolis of the west  and whose eloquence so mystifies his  faithlessness to ireland as to confuse you  and almost lade you captive   until  on cooler deliberation  you find that his response to  the toast  of the evenin   is naither more nor less than a superb burst of oratory   robed in green and goold  but with a heart as purely english as that  which throbbed within the breast of the renegade wellington or the late  wily lord palmerston  oh  no  the st  patrick societies of america  and  of every other portion of the globe  are simply whited sepulchres  or  false beacons erected or fosthered by the english governmint to mislade  the unsuspectin portions of our race from the allagiance due to their  own counthry  by studiously inculcatin sintimints and ideas favorable  to english supremacy  which can be paraded before the world as the thrue  expression of the irish people  in relation to the red that governs  them  and their willinness to remain as they are  part and parcel of the  impire  sich min as the two i have jist mintioned do more to perpetuate  the thraldom of our country than the most unfrindly and subtle statesman  that exists on the other side of the atlantic to day  bekase they are  powerful inemies  by their example in our own camp  and bekase there are  those amongst us who are aisily led  and who consequintly fall a victim  to their influence and example       sure  we all know  that the scotch thricksther at the head of the  govermint here  could do but little if it was not for such people  as ogle r   george  l   darcy and  the docther   as he is called in  toronto  and thus it is  that although the three toronto gintlemen that  i now name  are  i honestly believe  deservedly respected and esteemed  in every other relation of life  they belong body and sowl to the  english sintimint of the counthry  and if the most favorable opportunity  was offered them to morrow  would never raise a helpin hand to place the  green above the red  but  as this is dhry work  and as i have not had  sich a bout at it since i opened here  come  one and all  and let us  wet our whistles  for i see you have jist made spy glasses of your  tumblers            chapter ii       although delivered in a style somewhat uncouth  there was a great deal  of truth and native eloquence about these observations of o brien  there  is no doubt but the st  patrick societies of this continent  and perhaps  of the world  are characterized  in no ordinary degree  by the spirit  and design to which he alluded  in so far as those belonging to the  british empire are concerned  he was right  almost without an exception   for it must be admitted  that these societies are  for the most part   filled with pseudo patriots  who discard all revolutionary theories  and  are of the opinion  that the independence of their country  if they  ever cast a glance in that direction  ought to be achieved in the most  lady like manner  and with  white kids   look  for instance  at some of  the members of these associations and kindred bodies in new york and  in various other parts of the union  and analyze the spirit which finds  expression in their observance of the anniversary of ireland s tutelar  saint  from the moment that the cloth is removed  until the last of the  company gyrates out of the room to his carriage  we have nothing but  a war of eloquence between rival politicians who are candidates for  municipal or other lucrative honors  or a subtle bid for irish support  through some adroit manoeuvre  by which an adversary is  for the time  being  thrown into the shade  to be sure  mr  richard this or mr  john  that  may occasionally give us a taste of his research and learning   in a re hash from the  annals of the four masters   or from some of the  leading periodicals of the day  and we may  in addition  be treated  to an  original  poem touching ireland from some of the various  up hill workers of the muses  with whom the great mercantile centre  abounds  but as to anything practical relative to the amelioration of  the wretched condition of the country in whose name they assemble upon  such occasions  that is simply out of the question  all parties  as a  general thing  satisfying themselves with a hacknied and stereotyped  enumeration of her wrongs  and the usual bland denunciations of her  oppressors     and here we give an illustration of st  patrick societies under their  most patriotic aspect  for the power of speech which characterizes  this  great commonwealth  and our total immunity from english persecution   enable the spirit which actuates these societies  beneath the skull and  cross bones of st  george  to be a little more patriotic here  in its  language at least  than it dares to be in any portion of the dominions  of england  still  its positive antagonism to irish independence  under  the british flag  is scarcely more reprehensible than its negative  influence in the same direction under the stars and stripes  so that  ireland  suffering at their hands alike  might with every degree of  justice place them in the same category     after all  it is the masses that free a nation  and thank god for it   a leader may in vain look for a host to follow him  but a host never in  vain for a leader  and hence the defection of a few prominent men from  the great  irish national idea which now so moves this continent  and  commands the attention of the world  amounts to but little save sorrow  at the stigma it casts upon our race  the rank and file of our people  are true to the spirit that fired the o neill s and the geraldines of  old  and this being the case  the freedom of ireland is secured beyond  any possible contingency  england is brought to bay at home and abroad   the mighty embodiments of irish power and patriotism  yclept fenianism   stalks forth through the empire with an uplifted glaive in its hand  and  no one can say how soon or where the swift stroke of destruction shall  fall  its presence fills with gloomy alarm every nook and corner of  the land  and paralyzes all the energies of the oppressor  through its  overwhelming influence  the most cherished institutions of the usurper  are being overthrown  and the crown and mace all but converted into  baubles  it has destroyed the power and prestige of a hereditary  aristocracy  and thrown  in a measure  the whole government of the land  into the hands of commoners  the privileged classes  no longer oracular   recede before it  and a great democratic idea occupies the ground upon  which they stood  in short  illuminated and impelled by the glorious  spirit and impulses which moved the immortal founders of this grand  republic of the west  it has gone forth to avenge and to conquer  and  to build up upon the shores of the old world such a grateful monument  to the genius of american freedom  as shall  from its lofty summit   pour its radiance over the darkest valleys of central europe  until the  frozen grasp of despotism yields to its magic touch and the chains  shall fall from the bleeding limbs of millions  who on emerging from the  valley and shadow of death into the pure sunlight of liberty  shall sing  paeans in honor of the great american people who first taught humanity  to the nations of the earth     when all present had done justice to o brien s proffered  treat   and  when greaves seemed to be moved to a friendly view of irish nationality   in a gap in some desultory conversation that happened to occur casually   this latter worthy asked whether he could be accommodated with a room at   the harp   while he remained in town  as he was a stranger in a great  measure  and having accidentally  as he said  made the acquaintance  of one he believed to be an agreeable landlord  tom replied in the  affirmative  for  in connection with the saloon business  he kept a  few boarders and had  besides  ample accommodation for more than one  occasional guest  soon then  greaves  who was to send the following  morning to the railroad station for his luggage  picked up a small  traveling bag by his side  asked to be shown to his room  as he  professed to be somewhat tired  and bidding the company  good night    while shaking hands with barry  disappeared with tom down the long  passage which led to his sleeping apartment on the floor above     when o brien returned to the bar  half a dozen more of his usual  customers had dropped in to exchange a kindly word with him  and taste  his newest  on tap   before reaching the counter  however  and just as  he was passing barry  he whispered something in the ear of the latter   which seemed to arrest his attention  and to which he appeared to answer  with a significant nod and peculiar expression of countenance  barry  being off duty  and having received permission to remain in town all  night  paid no regard to the nine o clock drums and fifes audible from  the garrison  and although quite an abstemious young fellow  he made  himself sufficiently social with the new comers  most of whom were  acquaintances  the remainder of the evening was passed in the usual  bar room style  although the conversation for the most part  turned upon  the wrongs of ireland and the mode of redressing them  now that greaves  had retired  there appeared to be less restraint upon the few who had  been a witness of the observations he had made upon the subject  for  they one and all seemed to flow into the common channel of sympathy  so  largely occupied by o brien in this connection  in addition  one of them  ventured to remark  that although greaves pretended to be an englishman   he was evidently no such thing  for on more than one occasion  he gave  utterance to expressions that were not only purely irish  but tinged  with a genuine irish accent and native peculiarity  that no mere  accident could account for  and which was  without doubt  the genuine  thing itself peeping out at the elbows of a foreign dress  this idea  seemed to find favor with o brien  although barry was not impressed  with its correctness  from the fact  no doubt  of his constant  intercommunication with the english and irish element that was so  jumbled up in his company     as it became later  the party began to drop off  until about twelve  o clock  up went the shutters and round went the heavy key in the  bar room door  all having disappeared at the latter period  save barry  and one of his most intimate friends who seemed loath to leave  and  inclined to take another glass  no sooner then  were the doors and  windows securely fastened  and the gas extinguished  than both these  parties accompanied by tom with a bed room lamp in his hand  proceeded  to a small and comfortable apartment which was sacred to the foot of  every individual who was not a tried friend of o brien  here all three  seated themselves beside a comfortable coal fire that burned brightly in  the grate  when tom  on extinguishing the lamp  after having lit the jet  of gas that hung in the centre of the room  exclaimed        nick  my name s not tom o brien  or we have got the divil  up stairs   but what he s up to it s hard to say  although i thought it  was jist as well to let him take up his quarthers here  seem that i ll  be able to keep an eye on him  now that the times are becomin sarious       certainly   replied barry   his appearance is far from prepossessing   but you know  tom  it s not always safe to judge a man by this  criterion       that s thrue   returned the other   but didn t you hear the fella how  he wanted to sift you about the irish sintiment of the garrison  as well  as lade us out upon the feelins of the irish in gineral throughout the  province       i did  of course   answered nick   but really thought that the  gentleman  being a stranger  was simply asking for information s sake  only  and had no ulterior object in view       i agree with you  o brien   interrupted the third party  who was named  burk  and who had been in the saloon during the period greaves was  present   there can be nothing good in so cunning a face  but what is  the real news to night  and have you heard from new york or buffalo       i have harde from both places   returned tom   and everythin looks  well  but how are things here  and are you all prepared to assist the  invading army when they cross the lines  and what number of men can we  fairly count upon       it has  i believe  been ascertained beyond a shadow of doubt   replied  burk   that there are upwards of one hundred thousand men throughout the  provinces who would at once rush to arms if they found the flag of the  irish republic firmly planted at any one point within our borders  while  it is known or believed  that more than twice that number would follow  in their wake  if toronto was once in the hands of the invaders  in  fact  toronto and montreal once taken  the day is ours  for we should  have the french almost to a man  no matter what monsieur george etienne  or master john alexander may say to the contrary  canada is evidently  tired of british rule  and is only kept from kicking over the traces  by a pack of government officials who hold the purse strings  and a  subsidized press that destroys the homogeneity of the people  by making  them doubt each other  and impressing every man disaffected to the  crown  with the idea that every other individual colonist  or nearly  so  is opposed to him  in this way  the sentiment of independence  which underlies the nine tenths of our population is obstructed and  embarrassed  and one man prompted to look with distrust upon another   although both may entertain precisely the same sentiments in relation  to the desirability of throwing off the british yoke  as to how the army  stands  nick here can tell you more about that than i can       the army   said barry   is just as you might expect it to be  the irish  who compose it in part  are  as you know  not british soldiers from  choice  but from necessity  they had no resource between starvation and  a red coat  so that their oath of allegiance to the english crown may be  said to have been exacted from them under pain of death  for ages  their  country had been devastated and plundered by the power that now holds  them in special thrall  and the means of existence wrested from them  through the inhuman exactions of a tyrannical government  their name and  race had been banned  their humble homesteads razed to the ground  and  their families scattered  naked and hungry  throughout the length and  breadth of the land  or exiled to foreign shores  the stranger had  stolen in on their hearthstone  robbed them of their lands  goods and  chattles  usurped their powers of local legislation  and then closed  every door to preferment against them  leaving them without a hope or a  crust for the future  on their own shores  under this horrible pressure   thousands of them necessarily gave way and fell victims to those gaunt  recruiting sergeants of the government  hunger and rags  unable to earn  wherewithal to keep body and soul together at their own doors  or within  their own borders  and perceiving that the commerce  the manufactures  and all the native resource of their country were crushed to the  earth  beneath the relentless heel of the oppressor  they fell into  the pit fall dug for them by an accursed perjurer and traitor  and   in obedience to the first law of nature  assumed her livery  and swore  allegiance to her flag  but think you that either god or man attaches  the slightest importance to an oath exacted under such circumstances   here am i  nick barry  now in the service of the usurper  and driven  into it with tears in my eyes and rebellion in my heart  and do you  suppose that i regard my oath as other than an additional incentive to  plot the downfall of the infamous tyrant and robber who hounded me  into swallowing it  and who  to day  keeps the girl i love out of her  mother s property  that  on a mere technicality  was laid hold of  and  thrown into chancery  by a villainous and traitorous relative  long in  the secret service of the government at home  when he found the poor   young thing an orphan  and without a wealthy friend in the world to  back her  and that too  upon a claim that hadn t a leg to stand upon  as  everybody knew  my soldier life  and his continued absence in england   prevented my meeting the villain before he died  but as he has left the  suit to his son  who  i learn  is no better than he was himself  and is  also a great hanger on about the castle of dublin  i am in hopes of one  day or other meeting this same gentleman  who purports to represent the  old villain in this case  when  no matter how the chancery suit may go   i shall hold him to a severe reckoning for the injustice and  hardships to which she has been so long subjected through their joint  instrumentality  but why should she complain any more than tom there   whose father s side of the house  once powerful and wealthy  in the  west of ireland  have been all but beggared through the same infamous  government  and their accursed agents  who had plundered them of every  acre they possessed  and exiled the bravest and best of them to these  distant shores      these few observations were made with an earnestness and vehemence that  showed how fierce and hostile the blood that boiled in the veins of  the speaker  nor was there any appeal from the inexorable logic of  his remarks  from the inhuman manner in which england has  for  seven centuries preyed upon the vitals of ireland  and plundered and  expatriated her children  the latter are morally absolved from all  allegiance or fidelity to her  no matter what the circumstances of  their plighted faith  no man should be bound by oaths or obligations   to maintain the supremacy or defend the interests of a tyrant  exacted  under an inhuman pressure or in the presence of such an alternative  as the poor irish recruit is subject to  namely  that of enlisting or  starving  how can any irish soldier  possessed of a single spark of  pride or patriotism  and wearing the queen of england s livery to day   be other than the deadly enemy of the representative of a people who  have laid his country waste  murdered his kindred and left him and  millions of his race without a roof to cover them on their own native  shores  how can he gaze with any degree of enthusiasm or pleasure upon  the blood stained rag that waved over mullaghmast  that was perjured at  limerick  and that endorsed with its baleful glare all the demoniacal  atrocities of the penal laws   resistance to tyrants is obedience to  god   therefore the children of ireland who have been so long trodden in  the dust under the feet of an usurper  are but obeying the dictates of  heaven and of humanity  when  by every means within the boundaries of  civilization  they endeavor to encompass not only their own redemption  from the bonds of the oppressor  but the total destruction of his power  in every connection  ireland owes no allegiance to england  for seven  hundred years she has been crying out against the colony of foreign  bayonets that have kept her in bondage and reduced her to beggary  for  one single hour  throughout the whole of that long period  she has  never voluntarily accepted the condition of her thraldom  or bowed  submissively beneath the british yoke  she therefore cannot be regarded  in the light of a conquered nation  but must be looked upon as still  engaged in the deadly and mortal contest  whose first field was fought  long years ago  between the anglo norman freebooters and the fenians  of cuan na groith  or the harbor of the sun  when strongbow  at the  instance of the second henry  made an unprovoked descent upon her  shores      yes   replied tom  when barry had finished   both i and mine have felt  the cruel fangs of the despoiler  but  sure  where is the use of singlin  out ourselves  when the whole of the thrue native irish  which manes the  nineteenth twintieths of the kingdoms are jist as badly off  the quarrel  is not yours nor mine  nor the grievances naither  both belong to every  man  woman and child possessed of a pure dhrop of irish blood in their  veins  for all have suffered alike  as far as that is consarned  and   now  all that has to be done on the head of it  is jist to wait the nick  of time that we are all expectin  and then  with one well directed and  united blow  dash the tyrant to the ground on this side of the atlantic   and thrust to providence  the sympathy of the great american people and  our own sthrong arms and hearts for the rest       quebec and the fort beyond there   observed burk   may give us some  trouble  but further than this  from what has been ascertained of the  province generally  there is little to be apprehended  the intimate  business relations and the intermarriages between the canadians and the  people of the united states  will exercise a most powerful influence  in the case  while the manner in which both the english and canadian  governments fomented the recent civil war on the other side of the  lines  cannot fail to have embittered the american people against the  british flag  wherever it is to be found  the treacherous attack of  england upon the existance of the republic  in subsidizing the south  with arms and money  and in destroying  as she did for a considerable  period  the american carrying trade  through the instrumentality of  pirates built and fitted out in her own ship yards and docks  will now  afford the american government an opportunity of paying her off in kind   through permitting fenianism to pursue its course without interruption   until the provinces become part and parcel of the union  when they  have served as a basis of operation for the purpose of fitting out  expeditions against the arch enemy of ireland and of human freedom  and  contributed to the final redemption of that oppressed country from the  bonds in which it has so long lain  surely  what is sauce for the goose  is sauce for the gander  and if england  through the house of commons   cheered the alabama when her destructive qualities were described before  that body by mr  laird  and  after having built the pirate  sent her out  to make war upon the north when it was in sore trouble  surely  i say   america will not be over anxious to throw obstructions in the way of any  party who may take in hand the chastisement of such an infamous power   no matter what the grounds of the quarrel  but when it comes to be  understood that for the last ninety years  and up to a very recent  period  england has been the deadly defamer and the secret or avowed  enemy of america and american institutions  when it comes to be  understood  that the statesmen  the business men and the wives and  daughters of the citizens of the american commonwealth  ever since the  immortal washington won the day for the oppressed of the whole world   have been subjected to the sneers and jibes of the english aristocracy  and press  and held up to the ridicule of despotic europe  when this  comes to be understood  i repeat  in connection with the fact  that  the cause of ireland is the cause of human liberty and of republican  institutions  there will be but little fear of america stepping out of  her way to uphold the skull and cross bones of st  george  either on  this or on the other side of the atlantic ocean  or  in fact  in any  portion of the globe       nor will the clear sighted children of the republic be cajoled into a  friendly attitude towards this blood thirsty dastard  because that  in  the feebleness and fear that have now overtaken her  she essays to gloze  over the infamous acts of which she stands convicted before the nations   and assumes an air of friendship towards them  had the union fallen   through her infernal machinations  not a city throughout her dominions  but would have blazed with joyful illuminations at the result  while her  government would again introduce the impressments of       even when the  slightest reverse was suffered by the arms of the north  the news was  heralded throughout the whole of england with tokens of the most intense  satisfaction  while both her people and statesmen took a fiendish  delight in referring to the commonwealth as  the late united states    all this  i say  will influence  and ought to influence  america in  favor of the independence of ireland  and prevent the american people  from regarding the present pusillanimous blandishments of john bull as  other than simply the result of cowardice  and an attempt to propitiate  a great power that had survived his infernal machinations  and now looms  up a just and mighty avenger before him  so long then  as england is  permitted to hold ireland  that is battling for her rights  in chains   or to taint permanently the pure atmosphere of this free continent   so long will the stars and stripes shine with subdued lustre  and the  memory of the immortal heroes of     be but half honored  by those who  are pledged to defend it to the death in the sight of both god and man       as to quebec and the other garrisons down this way   observed barry    when hamilton and toronto are in the hands of the army of the irish  republic  they will be easily managed  none of the strongholds are proof  against irish sympathizers  in their vicinity  this i know to be true   every genuine irishman within easy hailing distance of the garrison at  quebec  has more than one tried friend within its walls  and so of the  other strongholds along the st  lawrence and lakes  but supposing  for  argument s sake  that any of those forts should take it into its head  to stand a siege  where would it be when invested with such an army  as fenianism can now put into the field  composed of thousands upon  thousands of veterans who are still grim with blood and smoke from the  terrible fields of the south  what  too  would your militia do  with  their holiday legs and maiden swords  against the men who fought at cold  harbor  gettysburg or bull run  why the one fourth of the force which it  is said fenianism has at its command  would sweep canada like a tornado  from sanwich to gaspe  and be recruited every yard of the road  besides   while the instant one signal victory was won by them  the government of  the united states would at once acknowledge them as belligerants  this   i believe  is the true state of the case  and if the fenian organization  across the lines  and here amongst us  possess honest  brave and  competent leaders  the overthrow of england in the provinces cannot fail  to be achieved  for  after all  she has no secure footing in the hearts  of the masses  and enjoys nothing but a mere official existence here   under the protection of her guns  and through the instrumentality of a  corrupt government and a hireling press  but as it is getting well up  in the small hours  and as i feel i need some rest  i think i ll take  another tumbler  if you only join me  and then turn in            chapter iii       when young barry spoke of the girl of his love  he referred to kate  mccarthy  now in her twentieth year  and certainly one of the most  beautiful irish girls that had emigrated to america for many a long day   kate and he had been schoolfellows and neighbors from their infancy   and  as they grew up  were regarded as a sort of  matter of course  match   from the fact  that they were always together  and apparently  cut out for each other  they were both natives of the county leitrim   and born on the banks of the shannon  in the sweet little town of  drumsna  it was by the beautiful waters of this noble river that they  first felt that impassioned glow that colors all the after life of man  or woman  and which is as different from the feelings that characterize  early boy or girlhood  as the noon day solar blaze is from the cold and  placid beams of the pale new moon  there is one point at which the  true passion of love  in all great hearts  leaps into fierce and  instantaneous existence  there may be many imperceptible approaches  to it in some cases  we know  but out of these it is possible to turn  aside  when the hour arrives  however  in a single moment the storming  party  under one wild impulse  unknown before  mounts the ramparts of  the heart  and  after a moment s sweet confusion  the garrison falls and  is surrendered forever into the hands of the enemy  and thus it was with  our hero and heroine  although they had long been the dearest of friends  and constant companions  although they had long felt that the happiness  of the one was necessary to that of the other  the great secret of their  existence was never fully revealed to them  until they felt they were  about to be separated from each other for an indefinite period  kate  to accompany her only relatives to america and poor barry to enter the  british army  under a pressure of poverty too dreadful to relate  as  already intimated  the prospects of both had been blighted through  oppression and villainy  brought to bear upon them by distant relatives   who were the infamous agents of a still more infamous government  the  case of nick  although sore enough in its way  was not so heartrending  as that of kate  he was of a sex fitted to wrestle with the storms  of life  but she  proud and brave as she was  occupied a different  position  fortunately for both  however  through the instrumentality  of a small pittance set aside by the courts in her case  and a kind  relation in that of barry  their education was far above their  pecuniary pretensions  so that at the age of twenty kate was really an  accomplished and refined girl  while her lover  at that of twenty five   was a dashing young fellow  with a well stored mind and quite as capable  of acquitting himself agreeably in society as any man  no matter  what his rank  in the regiment to which he belonged  it was  then  in  consequence of his education that he was looked up to by his comrades   although neglected and studiously kept in the back grounds by some of  the officers of his company  who  viewing his attainments through  the medium of their english spectacles  closed the door of preferment  against him  and never suffered a single stripe to appear on his jacket   with as good blood in his veins as the best of them  and with a sense of  the wrongs inflicted upon his country by the government whose abettors  they were  he could never bring himself to stoop to the fawning and  servility through which the lower grades of rank are attainable  only  in the service  and thus  it was that  from first to last  he was  viewed with an eye of suspicion by his superiors  who regarded him as  an incorrigible young irishman  who  notwithstanding that he wore  the uniform of a british soldier  had no love for the service or the  interests it represented     barry entered the army under the most terrific pressure only  he found  that kate and her friends were destined for america  and being himself   at the period  totally destitute of funds and without the means of  realizing them speedily  in a moment of desperation he enlisted in a  regiment that was under sailing orders for that country  in the hope of  being stationed somewhere near the being he loved  and of being able  at  least  to keep up a constant and unbroken correspondence with her until  fortune should turn the wheel in his favor  and so he enlisted and  parted from kate and her friends  to follow her in a short period across  the atlantic  and renew his vows of love and affection upon another  shore     the ship that had borne her away from his view had been scarcely two  days at sea  when the deadly intelligence reached his ear that the  sailing orders of his regiment had been countermanded  and that instead  of proceeding to quebec  it was to sail for malta  where it was likely  to remain for perhaps a couple of years  this dreadful news almost  annihilated him  he had made a sacrifice to no purpose  and was now  bound hand and foot beyond the hope of redemption  before kate and he  parted  he had agreed to write her to quebec  in care of a friend  if  anything should occur that might postpone the sailing of his regiment   or that portion of it that was for foreign service  and now the dreadful  opportunity arrived  when he found himself called upon to convey to  her the intelligence  that not only was the sailing of the regiment  postponed  but its destination altered  in due course the fatal  disclosure reached her  and almost deprived her of life and reason  in  the space of one brief hour she passed through the agony of years   the being she loved  in the burning ardor of his young soul  had  hastily  thoughtlessly sacrificed his freedom  and all for her  it  had been a sufficient dagger to her soul to see him attired in the  blood stained uniform of the enemies of her country  yet she knew that  he had been driven by the most inexorable circumstances to assume the  hated garb  but now he was overtaken with twofold desolation  he was  a slave  and beyond the reach of one kind word of solace from her  for  whom he had sacrificed all  save and except that which might be borne to  him  through the ordinary channels  across the trackless deep     racked as she was with those torturing reflections  and while the first  wild burst of grief was yet rolling down her cheeks  she determined to  begin her lone  young widowhood by instantly writing to him and bidding  him hope  in this epistle  all the nobility of her true heart and nature  blazed forth so transcendently  and with such fierce  womanly fervor   that the moment it reached the hands of the young soldier the light was  re kindled within him  and he at once set about procuring his discharge   or rather realizing the means of effecting his release from the bonds  into which he had allowed his pure  though ungovernable passion to  betray him  his education  as already observed  was most excellent  and  now  when off duty  he turned it to good account  and slowly but surely  began to add daily to what trifle he was able to save from his paltry  pay  in the hope of yet commanding a sufficient sum to purchase his  freedom and enable him  ultimately  to sail for america  in this way   and during the two years he was stationed at malta  he spent his spare  moments  being throughout that whole period particularly fortunate in  keeping up what was life to him  an unbroken correspondence with his  beloved     at the expiration of three years  having been quartered  on his return  from the mediterranean  for the last one  in england  at length came the  welcome and startling intelligence  that the regiment  now indeed  was  to proceed forthwith to canada  where it would be likely to remain for  a considerable period  in a delirium of joy he communicated the happy  intelligence to his love  and had just time to receive a hurried epistle  in reply  in which the very arms of the true hearted and beautiful kate  seemed thrown open to receive him  for some months previously  however   she had been informing him  from time to time  of a very disagreeable  position in which she had been placed  through the persistent attentions  paid her by an irish gentleman named lauder  who  by some means or  other  had so ingratiated himself with her relatives  as to win them  over to urge his suit  and who was reputed to be a person of means   these hints  however disagreeable  were always accompanied by a renewal  of the vows they had long since plighted on the banks of the shannon   and the fervent assurance that no one living or yet to live should ever  lead kate mccarthy a bride to the altar  save her own nicholas barry     when kate and her relatives arrived at quebec  they remained in that  city but a short period  as they had friends at toronto  as well as  near fort erie and at buffalo  in the state of new york  whom they  were desirous of visiting  and near whom they had determined to settle  permanently  unfortunately for barry  the more intimate guardians  or relatives of kate had become unfriendly to his suit ever since he  entered the army  impressed  as they had become  with that irish idea   that the red coat of a private soldier in the british service was the  most disreputable that could be worn  in this light  therefore  they  encouraged the advances of lauder  in the hope that absence would so  weaken the first love of kate  as to induce her to yield ultimately to  her new suitor  but they little new the girl with whom they had to deal   for when lauder  under their sanction  made a formal declaration of his  passion to her  she quenched his hopes  as she supposed  forever  by  informing him that both her heart and her hand were previously engaged   and that were they even at her disposal  she should be quite unable  to bestow them upon any gentleman for whom she did not and could not  entertain a single particle of true love  although he might have secured  her esteem  this rejection  however  did not  as she supposed it would   preclude the possibility of any further advances from such a quarter   for lauder  nothing daunted  kept up the siege when and wherever he  could  without giving absolute offense  so cunningly and intangibly did  he still pursue the object set before him  at last  nevertheless  so  constant were his visits at the house  and so permanent a footing was he  getting in the estimation of her friends  that  after having resided at  toronto upwards of two years  she left it at the instance of one of the  family  who  on their first arrival in america  had settled in buffalo   to which city she proceeded  and in which she now took up her residence     while in toronto the thought struck her that she might be able to turn  whatever abilities she had to account  in the hope of being able to  accumulate sufficient funds to aid our young hero in purchasing his  discharge  fearing  as she did  that his own opportunities  in this  relation  would be greatly restricted  so with her needle  and through  the instrumentality of a small private school  she ultimately found  herself mistress of the required amount  and was about to forward it  to nicholas  at the very period when she received intelligence of his  regiment being ordered to america  she therefore thought it better  to wait until they met  as she had made up her mind to set out  when  apprised of his arrival  for any place in which he might happen to be  quartered  and there plan for their future and his freedom     in due time barry reached quebec  and from thence was ordered  with his  company  to the town in which we first encountered him  here he was soon  joined by the true hearted kate  who remained for a few days with her  cousins  big tom and his sister  during this period it was decided that  nicholas should purchase his discharge when he found that there was any  prospect of the regiment being called home  the reasons for his not  at once availing himself of the freedom he knew he could obtain at any  moment  need not now be referred to more minutely  and as kate left him  to return to buffalo  just four months previous to the opening of our  story  after having made more than one pilgrimage from the united states  to spend a few days with her cousins as she averred  it was settled upon  finally  that he should quit the service in the ensuing summer  when  they should become man and wife  as well as residents of the great  republic of the united states of america     the intimacy  then  between big tom and nick  is now accounted for in  a satisfactory manner  and thus it was  that whenever the young soldier  got leave to spend a night out of the fort  he invariably took up his  quarters at the sign of the harp  where he not only knew he was welcome  on his own account  but was sure to find company that was agreeable to  him  and sympathized with all his aspirations in relation to his poor   down trodden country     kate mccarthy  as we have already said  was in her twentieth year at  the time we were first introduced to o brien and his customers  and  certainly  as previously intimated  a more lovely woman could scarcely  be found in a day s walk  her face and figure were absolute mirages of  beauty  while  if there could be such a thing as black sunbeams  her  eyes and hair would have illustrated them to intensity  she was above  the medium height  with a slightly olive complexion that harmonized  superbly with the glorious orbs through which the pure light of her soul  poured forth a mellow blaze  and the dark  heavy tresses that fell in  shining masses upon her pearly shoulders  nothing  too  could surpass  the intensified loveliness of her soft  rounded arms  and exquisitely  shaped hands and feet  while her delicious mouth and beautifully  chiseled nose and ears were really mysteries of loveliness so rare  that  few could entertain the idea that she who possessed them could have laid  her whole heart at the feet of a common soldier  and that  too  when it  was in her power to turn such charms to high account in the every day  market of society  but she knew nicholas barry and the nobility of his  nature  and was aware  in addition  that had he not  like herself  been  the victim of foul play and of a government that fostered crime in its  adherents  he would never have been constrained to swear allegiance to  the flag he both hated and despised  or have been obliged to exchange  the garb of the son of a true irish gentleman for that which had so  lowered him  in the eyes of her relatives at least  but rich or poor   in scarlet or homespun  he was all the same to her  and now that he was  almost at her side  and master  in a measure  of his own fate  she only  looked forward to the period when she should have a legal right to his  protection  and to call him by that name which  beyond all others is the  one that lies nearest a woman s heart     the relative and his wife with whom kate lived in buffalo  were  in  reality  noble and true hearted people  they had known nicholas from his  childhood  and had always loved him for his manliness and bold struggles  to gain some position at home in which he might be able to realize a  sufficiency to maintain both himself and the girl of his love  before he  led her to the altar  they had witnessed his repeated failures when he  applied for any vacant situation where his education could be turned to  account  and felt for his dire disappointment upon many an occasion  when he was denied even a subordinate office in connection with the  management of the large property that had once belonged to his family   with pain and anger they saw his praiseworthy exertions baffled at every  turn  and  unlike the rest of their relations  discovered more of his  self sacrificing spirit still  in the desperate step he took for the  purpose of joining his betrothed upon a foreign shore  a step which they  would have gladly prevented  had their own slender means been sufficient  to have transported him with them to their new home  moved by this  spirit of kindness and esteem  these worthy people were the very  main stay of kate in the hour of her sorest trial  and now that barry  was near her once more  they entered heart and hand into all her  projects  and were delighted to know that his discharge should be  purchased before his regiment was ordered to leave the colony     it must not be presumed  however  that kate  since her arrival in  america  had permitted herself to be a burden  in even the slightest  degree  upon any of her friends or relations  far from it  from the  moment that they became settled at toronto  up to the hour of nicholas   arrival in the colony  she not only supported herself through her  industry and perseverence  but contributed  in a degree  to  the maintenance of some of them also  of course  in view of the  all absorbing object she had before her  regarding her lover  she could  not be expected to do much in this latter relation  yet she did what  she could  and so satisfied her pride and her conscience  sometimes the  recollection of the long and weary chancery suit would obtrude itself  upon her  but only to provoke a hopeless and languid smile  prompted  by the conviction that her enemy  whom she had never seen  and who had  recently succeeded to the claims of his father  philip darcy  now but  a few months dead  had too much influence with the government and its  legal minions  to permit her to indulge in the slightest hope  that   were the case decided tomorrow  it could be otherwise than against her   consequently  it mattered but little to her whether she was worsted  by philip the elder or philip the younger  so  in this way  she  now invariably disposed of the unpleasant matter  yet  she felt   notwithstanding  deeply and bitterly upon the subject  and knew that she  was the victim of a most diabolical plot  but she did not permit this  to interfere with her daily avocations  or induce her to sit down in  apathetic sorrow  and repine over a fate that no effort of hers could  influence in any degree whatever     still  as may be readily supposed  both from her education and a  knowledge of her own personal wrongs  and those which had for centuries  been inflicted upon the unhappy land of her birth  she was no friend or  admirer of the government or people who had wrought her so much ruin in  this connection  on this head she was most inexorable  and felt that  it was the duty of every true irishman and irishwomen in existence  to  conspire  as best they could  against a power which had plunged their  race and country into such frightful ruin  and she believed  firmly   that  in so far as her native land was concerned  its children were  justified in using any means by which they could rid themselves of  a tyrant and usurper  who  in violation of every law  both human and  divine  subjected them to sword and flame for ages     it will be perceived  then  that both kate mccarthy and nicholas were  influenced by the same just and deadly spirit against england  and that  neither thought it otherwise than meritorious  to hurl that tyrant  to the dust  at any time and under any circumstances  the iron had  penetrated their souls  and now that rumors were afloat touching the  intention of the great organization of fenianism  which overspread  the american union  to make a descent upon the canadas  with a view  to destroying the power of england upon this continent  and ultimately  rescuing ireland from the grasp of the oppressor  kate s eye was lit   from time to time  with the most patriotic fervor  while the world  could  at any moment  discover the true nature of the fame that burned  within her soul  from the emerald sheen of the silken band which  invariably bound up her raven hair  and encircled her snowy throat     once or twice she happened to encounter lauder in buffalo  so as to  recognize him without the possibility of mistake  while on several  occasions  she could not divest herself of the idea that he had just  passed her in disguise  although she could not imagine what prompted him  to such secrecy  when she never noticed him since she had left toronto   or recognized him on the two occasions when she chanced to meet him in  the public street  yet  a strange presentiment seemed to impress her  that he had not  after all her plainness with him  abandoned the idea  of obtaining her hand  notwithstanding the repugnance she had always  evinced towards him  now  however  that nicholas was almost within hail  of her  and that her friends  in buffalo at least  were true to her  in every relation  she felt secure from whatever machinations her  imagination conjured up  and  therefore  whenever the subject suddenly  obtruded itself upon her thoughtful moments  she dismissed it as  summarily  reassured by the conviction that she was totally beyond the  reach of any schemes that might have been concocted in relation to her  or her future     for the purpose  however  of setting the matter at rest forever  she  was resolved that her lover should leave the service now as early as  possible  and  stimulated by this desire  on returning to her residence   one evening towards the middle of april of the year in which we first  encountered him on the bridge leading from the fort  she addressed a  letter to nicholas  urging him to leave the army as soon as practicable   assigning as a reason the presence of lauder in buffalo  whom she had   as she felt assured  again encountered or rather discovered in the  vicinity of her residence  and adding a further reason  based upon the  rumor  that the army of the irish republic would soon move upon canada   and that his regiment could not fail to be called out to oppose it  a  circumstance that would  as she well knew  be the cause of more actual  pain to him  than anything that could possibly occur in the discharge of  what was termed his duty     this letter barry received the second day after it was written  and on  consulting with o brien  at once set about procuring his discharge  but  as the colonel of his regiment had gone to the lower provinces  from  which he was not to return for a week or two  the matter was left in  abeyance until he should again arrive in town  in due course  however   he did return  and the necessary application being made  no objection  was offered to granting the discharge  as barry s conduct had always  been most unexceptionable since he entered the service     in this way matters stood  then  on the night on which we found big  tom in secret conclave with his two friends  nick and burk  in his own  little sanctum  nick having got leave to stay out until morning  as the  officer in command informed him  it was probably the last request he  should have the power of granting him           chapter iv       an organization so wide spread and so numerous as that of the fenian  brotherhood  it was not to expected that all its members  without an  exception  were good men and true  yet so rarely were traitors found  among its ranks  that no patriotic confraternity of its magnitude had  ever  in ancient or modern times  presented so pure a record in this  relation  when we take into consideration the fact that  the insidious  and subsidizing gold of england was brought to bear upon the frightful  poverty of the masses that composed the organization in ireland  as well  as the temptations to treason held out by the government  through their  agents in the republic of the united states of america  the wonder is  that there were not more corydons and masseys to do the work of the  usurper  and betray the cause to which they had sworn fealty  however   there were traitors sufficient at work to cause great damage in  individual cases  and send many a brave fellow into the gloomy depths  of a british dungeon  nearly all the injury in this connection  however   appears to have been done at home  as treason of this character was  totally powerless under any foreign flag  or at least not so capable  of direct mischief  from the first moment of the inception of the  organization  the british and the canadian governments had their paid  spies in and outside the american press  who kept the authorities well  informed as to all the particulars that transpired within the range of  their observation or through other channels  but these disclosures were  necessarily meagre and  in many cases  totally unreliable  from the  circumstance that those disreputable parties  for the purpose of  magnifying their importance  and securing further the patronage of their  employers  colored and distorted facts so terribly  that scarce a  line from their pens or a sentence from their lips was worthy even  the slightest credence  still  from time to time  some little rumor  struggled to the surface  which pointed to treachery somewhere  and  thus it was that the authorities of the organization were often  placed awkwardly in relation to the idle though dangerous gossip which  occasionally singled out this individual or that  as the party who had  betrayed his trust  in the various cities along the american frontier   there was from time to time a good deal of this gossip  a circumstance  that might have been quite easily accounted for  seeing that the  inhabitants of some of these places were in what might be termed hourly  intercommunication with the people of canada  giving  in some cases   rise to suspicions  which were in the main without any foundation  this  distrust  although affecting the stability or growing prosperity of the  brotherhood in scarcely any degree  had yet the effect of strengthening  the hands of british sympathizers in the union  and inducing them  to resolve themselves into little coteries or societies  such as was  hurriedly formed not long since under the influence and guidance of  mr  h      of buffalo  for the ostensible purpose of aiding destitute  canadians  but with the real design of keeping an eye upon fenianism   and disclosing  as far as the members could divine  all its intentions   hopes and prospects  to the british government  occasionally an  emissary  direct from great britain  in the guise of a lecturer or  tourist  visited these associations and received their report  which  as  far as was practicable  he verified by personal observation  and  through whatever reliable channels  he believed to be open to him  these  emissaries have been supplemented by others of a somewhat different  character  but all bearing upon the interests of england  in this latter  case  however  it has been the direct unfriendly relations between the  american government and that of great britain  which had stimulated the  pilgrimages of certain individuals of this class to the shores of the  great republic  england perceiving that she had fenianism to deal with  on the one hand  and american hostility  regarding her infamous course  during the late war  on the other  in her cowardly fears for the  consequences  backed up her anti fenian agents  by sending out such  persons as mr  charles dickens and mr  henry vincent  to prove to the  citizens of the commonwealth how friendly the sentiments that england  had always entertained for them  and how disasterous a thing it would be  to both peoples  should a war  under any circumstances  be permitted to  take place between them  both these gentlemen  and others  distinguished  and popular in their respective literary shades  went forth preaching  peace and good will between the saxons on the one side of the atlantic  and their so called american cousins on the other  with an audacity  the most barefaced and unaccountable  upon every possible occasion   opportune or otherwise  they wore the olive branch at their button hole   and described in periods the most eloquent  the identity of blood and  interests which characterized both nations  and which it were heinous  to ignore  notwithstanding that for ninety long years their infamous  government had been indulging in the most heartless sneers  insults and  injustice towards the press  the people and the executive of the united  states  notwithstanding that during the late war every reverse of the  arms of the republic was hailed with heartfelt joy by the english party   both at home and in canada  and that pirates were built and fitted out  under the very eyes of the british cabinet  and with the secret sanction  of that corrupt horde  to make war upon american commerce and destroy  the union in the hour of its extremity  notwithstanding all this  we  say  and maugre the kindred circumstance of subsidizing the south with  money and arms so as to prolong the fratracidal conflict until both  parties lay bloody and broken at the feet of english despotism  these  able and smooth tongued gentry had the accursed assurance to stand up in  most of the principal cities of the democracy  and assert broadly  that  england was the true and tried friend of republican institutions and of  the people who sustained them on the free continent of america  under  the liberal laws which accord freedom of speech to every man who touches  the shores of the republic  these men had  we know  a right to express   publicly or otherwise  their sentiments in this connection  how  treacherous and untenable soever  but what we could never fathom  was  the daring of any journal professing to be true to the interests of  freedom or those of the union  in endorsing those sentiments and setting  them forth to the world as truthful and worthy the acceptance of every  genuine american  no matter what his creed or party  an attempt so  monstrous to stullify all past experience and ignore all history has  never been made in any relation whatever  and the wonder is  that   few as they are  so many americans have been led astray by it  to any  individual  of even the most ordinary penetration  it must be obvious   that the present cringing and treacherous attitude assumed by england  towards the american people  is but the mask of a foul and dangerous  spirit  snatched up in a moment of mortal fear to be worn only until  some opportune moment arrives when it can be thrown aside with safety   revealing the old  familiar  demoniacal scowl which lurked unaltered  beneath its smiling exterior  america  to be true to herself  must  beware of such false lights  of the press as these  they are for  the most part subsidized by english gold  or so imbuded with english  sentiment  that the interests of the union are quite a secondary  consideration with them  in evidence of the truth of this assertion  we  have only to dwell upon the apathy with which these journalists regard  the building up of a dangerous despotism upon our borders  in the very  teeth of american traditions and sentiments  and in opposition to the  feelings of the masses whom it effects more immediately  and who were  not permitted by their tyrants to express a single opinion at the polls  on so grave a subject as the total disruption or remodeling of the  constitution under which they lived  look at the expression of nova  scotia on this head  and see how it reflects upon the course pursued  by the great american people in relation to the confederation of the  adjoining provinces  not long since the inhabitants of that section of  the new dominion set forth  in a memorial to the british government   that this same confederation was forced upon the people of the canadas   through falsehood  bribery and the vilest fraud  and  yet  free and  generous america  who assumes to be the day star of freedom on this  continent  and to the world  permitted this despotic measure to be  enforced at her own threshold  and in relation to a people  thousands  upon thousands of whom sympathized with her interests and institutions   and looked forward with longing eyes to the hour when the stars and  stripes should float from every flag staff and tower throughout the  whole of the english possessions in the new world  surely the missionary  spirit of the republic has not been best illustrated in this instance   nor can we discover now  how it is  that the authorities of the union  sit quietly playing at thumbs  while the parliament of the dominion  is voting millions for the defenses of the new despotism  and framing  projects that are intended to result in a line of impregnable forts  from sandwich to gaspe  and at every point where it is possible for  an invader to set foot upon their shores  wait until false  foul and  treacherous england can sit beneath the shadow of the guns of her infant  monarchy  on the canadian frontier  and then see if she does not begin  to show her cloven foot anew  let her once get a permanent foothold  among the newly projected fortresses along the st  lawrence and the  lakes  with quebec as their key  and the peace and prosperity of  america  as well as the stability of republican institutions  cannot be  counted as secure  for a single day  from petty annoyance  or perhaps  inroads of a more formidable character  this idea may  we know  be  scouted by those who have a well grounded faith in the destiny of the  american people and the power they undoubtedly possess in a naval and  military point of view  but  after all  a gun is a gun and a garrison  a garrison  and to allow an implacable and formidable enemy to possess  herself of either  within range of our fire sides  when we can prevent  it  is what we should call courting the presence of a bombshell on our  borders  that may at any moment be thrown into our midst     without dwelling further on this particular point  however  we may  observe  that through some of the channels already referred to  the  english government became aware  in       that it was the intention of  the irish nationalists in the united states to make a descent  at no  distant day  upon canada  and seize it as a basis of operations  with  a view to carrying out their projects for the redemption of ireland  in  connexion with this information  they found  also  that the troops in  canada were largely interspersed with irishmen  and it was consequently  deemed necessary to send a secret agent to the provinces to look into  the case and report upon it  or rather upon the sentiment of the irish  element in the colony  whether in or out of the army  in relation to  fenianism  this they thought could be best accomplished through the  instrumentality of a tried emissary of their own  as even from the  provincial cabinet conflicting accounts were arriving constantly in  relation to the all important subject  in furtherance of this view  the  castle of dublin was  of course  applied to  and a creature selected  to do the work  who was not himself fully aware that his position was  recognized by the imperial cabinet so decidedly  but simply fancied  himself in the capacity of a sort of trusty policeman  appointed by one  of the castle authorities  who was anxious to know for himself how the  case stood on the other side of the atlantic  this agent was one of the  cleverest of his class  and possessed of the most consummate cunning   and a spirit of reckless daring but seldom evinced by members of his  tribe  already he had rendered substantial service to the viceroy and to  england  as an inveterate spy  and a scoundrel who had  on more than one  occasion  distinguished himself in the witness box  in addition to his  investigations in canada  he was instructed to extend the line of his  observations to the united states also  and to move from point to point   as his own judgment might dictate in the premises  he was  of course   furnished with ample means to carry out successfully the project  intrusted to him  and although but little faith could be placed in his  integrity  so far as the disposal of the funds put in his hands were  concerned  yet  by an opportune circumstance  connected with his own  personal interest  and overriding any sum that was entrusted to him   the castle was enabled to hold him in check  no matter how he might be  tempted  or where he chanced to move  with his activity and fidelity  thus insured  this miserable wretch  who went in dublin by the name  of philip the spy  was despatched on his mission  and  in due coarse  arriving at quebec  set about it in his usual cautious and conning  manner  he visited the citadel as a stranger  under the ordinary pass  from the town major  and soon made himself agreeable in the dark  low  canteen among the soldiers  whenever he thought he discovered a young  and inexperienced irishman among the rank and file  he was unusually  pleasant and communicative  with such a companion he always moved about  the garrison  descanting upon its force and power  and imperceptibly  stealing into his good graces  until he found some opportunity of  making an apparently accidental enquiry touching the information he was  desirous of obtaining  in this way he became possessed of the knowledge  that even quebec held within its impregnable walls many a man who was  far from being the true friend of england  and who  as he surmised   waited the opportunity of not only deserting her flag  but betraying  her stronghold into the hands of her enemies  in this state of things  he could not but discover the truthfulness of the beautiful line of  the poet    coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt    for he  perceived that the mighty waters of the great atlantic were insufficient  to wash out the blood stains from the skirts of england in relation  to ireland  or to remove the deep hatred of the exiled children of the  latter  towards a tyrannical power that had held them in bitter thrall  so unjustly and so long     satisfied of this  and of the additional fact  that the garrison was  invulnerable from the river side only  and that much of the artillery  that manned the citadel was all but worthless  on the pretense of being  a friend to the cause of irish freedom and a deadly enemy to england   he learned that not only were there many fenian sympathizers within the  walls of the garrison  but that the city outside was literally alive  with similar friends  some of whom were to be found among the french  population  who had never forgotten england s treatment of the first  napoleon  or her conquest of canada in the days of wolf these he knew  himself were sore points with the lower canadians  and likely to bear  bitter fruit in relation to english interests in america  one day or  other  he perceived also that these facts  taken in connection with the  unfriendly feeling which england had engendered in the united states   through the alabama piracies and secret subsidies to the south during  the war that had just closed  would  tend to both foster and embolden  fenianism  until it grew almost into an institution in the new world  or  became  at least  a leading idea with no inconsiderable portion of both  the canadian and american people  he knew that every civilized nation  on the face of the earth  save england herself  sympathized with the  lamentable condition of the country to which he himself was a traitor   and such being the case  he felt how easy it would be on the part of  these sympathizers  to find a means of justifying almost any measure  that might be adopted against the usurper  by the organization at home  and abroad  he saw and felt all this  and thus it became him to be  doubly cautious  as he could not but understand  that were his mission  divined by those whom he was now hourly betraying into positions of  death or danger  it would go hard with him indeed  in fact  the idea  struck him  that england  with all her boasting  was but little better  than a camp in america  and that  as in ireland  she was surrounded here  also  by a hostile although a less demonstrative population     and  certainly  a truer deduction than this has never been drawn from  any premises whatever  the nine tenths of the loyalty of canada towards  the british crown  is superficial and terribly unreliable  subtract the  official and the orange element from the masses  and they would drift at  once into the arms of the united states  the events of      prove that  a strong undercurrent of american feeling exists in the colony  and  various subsequent disclosures prove that it is even now only restrained  by circumstances  when we find canadian representatives on the floor of  the house of assembly  threatening england with an appeal to washington  in a certain connection  and when we see americans filling some of the  highest offices in the dominion  and sitting at the council table with  the representatives of royalty  we may be sure that the interests of  great britain are not in safe keeping in such an atmosphere  and that  such persons can always be brought to see how necessary it is to the   material  welfare of the inhabitants of the canadas that they should  become part and parcel of the free and prosperous republic of the  united states  they cannot fail to see  that in their present dependent  position   lying  as they are  in the grasp of an english aristocrat   unacquainted with their wants and wishes  and who sympathizes only with  the crown  their trade  their commerce  and their internal resources  must suffer to a frightful extent  so long as they are outside the pale  of the union and under the british flag  so long will a mighty war cloud  hang upon their borders  that is liable to roll in upon them at any  moment  the fact is fixed and unalterable  that the people of ireland  have secured for all time a permanent footing on this continent  where  their numbers  wealth and influence have become irresistible  touching  any project that they may entertain within the limits of the american  constitution  we say the american constitution  for to this they have  sworn fealty  and its maintenance is to them a matter of the first  importance  a matter of life and death  from the fact  that it is to  its generous provisions and the liberal spirit of its framers and their  descendents  as well as to the kind sympathy of the american people in  general  that they now owe their all  were it not for the noble stand  against tyranny taken by the heroes of       and the subsequent glorious  career of the country they had freed from the grasp of the english  tyrant  ireland should be still laden with chains the most hopeless   but  now that free america has influenced her to higher aspirations than  she had ever felt previously in relation to human liberty and just and  enlightened government  it is probable that she shall become the first  fruits of american institutions on the despotic side of the atlantic   and raise her bright republican head  in the midst of the hoary  tyrannies of europe  a glorious monument to the genius of american  liberty and power  as well as to the memory of the immortal heroes of  the war of independence  who first taught manhood to the nations  and  hurled to the dust  beneath their feet  the foul and blood stained  braggart who had sought to build up her despotic rule upon their virgin  shores  in no way can america so justify the purity and sincerity of  her soul in relation to her institutions  as by hurling them against the  despotisms of the old world  and diffusing amongst its peoples   wherever she can with any degree of propriety  the blessings they are so  eminently calculated to impart  and no point stands more invitingly open  at the present moment for an experiment so indispensable to the true  prestige of her power and greatness  than ireland  self evident as the  fact is  that that country has for generations been kept in slavery  at the point of the bayonet  and plundered and starved by an accursed  despot and her own deadly enemy  too  she can with the greatest  possible ease move in the direction of breaking those galling bonds  and  wreathing the poor  fleshless limbs  so long lacerated by them  with the  flowery links which so bind her own glorious children in one harmonious  and invincible whole  so long as ireland lies groaning beneath the heel  of the usurper  so long shall america have failed in her mission  and  her duty towards god and man  she cannot be truly great  and sit down  beneath her own vine and fig tree  listlessly enjoying the blessings of  liberty  peace and plenty  while her kindred and friends lie in chains  on the opposite side of the atlantic  or while the infamous flag of the  despot who oppresses them  and who but recently sought to stab her  to the heart  floats in triumph on her very borders  both heaven and  humanity demand something more at her hands  and if actuated by no  higher motive than that of mere self preservation  or of providing  against a rainy day  we would advise her  in view of the powerful  armaments and the ingrained antagonisms which characterize europe in  every direction  to assist in establishing one friendly power at least  on the shores of the old world  which  in the hour of need  would make  common cause with her in the interests of freedom  justice and truth   this  and the fact of the attempt now being made by england to build  up an armed despotism in the new dominion of canada  are  in our humble  opinion  matters of the deepest moment to the great american people   while we are equally convinced  that  should they neglect to avail  themselves of their right to interpose wherever human suffering of the  most heart rending character obtains under the sway of a tyrant  or  where the peace and security of a whole continent is threatened  by  portentous and aggressive undertakings on its confines  the day  will arrive  and that speedily  when they will be afforded a bitter  opportunity of regretting their criminal apathy and neglect  without the  power of atoning for either           chapter v       although kate had  as we have already stated  encountered lauder on more  than one occasion in buffalo  without any very uneasy feeling as to his  unpleasant proximity  yet she was not totally devoid of suspicion that  she was  in some way or other  the cause of his presence in that city   true  she had rejected his heart and hand in the most decided manner   but then there was something about the man so obtrusive and yet so  cunning  that at times she could have wished herself totally beyond  has reach or hopes  as the wife of the noble young fellow she loved so  ardently  when in toronto  she had been sorely tried by the insidious  attacks and insinuations of her persecutor  bearing upon the character  and vocation of nicholas  regarding which he appeared to be exceedingly  well informed  he spoke of the uniform faithlessness of soldiers in  general  their wretched mode of life and morals  together with the  stigma that invariably attached to the wife of any individual who wore  a private s coat in the service  in addition  he seemed to be conversant  with the pecuniary embarrassments of kate  as well as with the  circumstances of the chancery suit  and  as he averred  the settled  opinion at home  that it would be soon decided  and  without any  possible doubt  in favor of the son of philip darcy  all this was  heart rending in the extreme to the poor girl  but yet her faith never  faltered for a single moment in the truth and fidelity of her lover  and  what cared she for aught else in the world  so long as he was left her  without spot or blemish  observing the foothold that lauder had in  the house and estimation of her relatives  she did not feel herself  at liberty to treat him with all the contempt and severity that he  deserved  so that she was too often  for appearances sake and out of  respect for the feelings of those under whose roof she was  constrained  not to notice in anger much that had escaped his lips regarding  nicholas  or  rather  the possible character which he had turned out to  be under the baneful influence of a soldier s life  when  however  she  accepted the hospitality and kindness of that portion of the family who  had taken up their residence in buffalo  and who were the staunchest  friends of young barry  she  at once  cut the acquaintance of her  rejected suitor  and  as already observed  passed him once or twice in  the street without deigning to notice him     this probed lauder to the quick  and aroused all the fiend within him   and now that barry had reached canada  he determined to work in some way  the ruin of either the one or the other  in order to make their union  impossible  were even the most revolting crime necessary to that end   while dwelling on this subject  every vestige of humanity disappeared  from the heart and face of the wretch who would encompass such ruin  and  that  too  in the case of two individuals who had never injured him in  thought  word or act  he was slighted and rejected by the only woman on  earth that he cared to marry  and he would be avenged at even the  risk of his life  he would dog her footsteps were she to move to the  uttermost ends of the earth  until an opportunity to put his infernal  plans in operation arrived  and as he had abundance of means at his  command  he would enlist in his service those who would not hesitate to  sell their souls for gold  moved by this diabolical impulse  he followed  her to buffalo  and there made the acquaintance of two unmitigated  villains who kept a low gambling house in one of the vilest streets in  the city  and who were capable of any atrocity known to the annals of  crime  these two vagabonds were already refugees from canadian justice   having been concerned in one of the bank robberies so frequent in the  provinces  and had an accomplice of their own stamp on the canadian  frontier  not far from their present den  to whom they were in the habit  of secretly forwarding goods stolen on the american side  to be  kept until the excitement regarding the robbery had subsided  and an  opportunity presented itself for disposing of them in some part of the  province where detection would be impossible  under the cover of night  one or the other of these wretches frequently stole across the lines  and visited this locality  where he remained concealed until a fitting  period occurred for returning to his old haunt     of this stamp were the two persons whom lauder now took into his  confidence and employment in relation to the abduction of kate mccarthy  from her friends  and her transportation into canada to some place of  secrecy and of safety  until he should be able to force her into an  alliance with him  or failing in this  make such a disposition of her  as should  at least  place an eternal barrier between her and nicholas   among their friends and acquaintances these two villains were known as   black jack  and the  kid    the former as forbidding a specimen of the  human race as ever breathed the vital air  he was low and thick set   with a neck like a bull  and a frame of prodigious strength   his nose  was broad and flat  his month large  his ears of immense size  his  forehead low and retreating  while the breadth between his ears at the  back of his head was inconceivable     his companion in crime  the kid  in so far as external appearance was  concerned  was his intensified antipodes  he was slightly formed and  of rather prepossessing appearance  and were it not for a sinister  expression of his full watery  grey eyes  remarkable when excited by  anger  and some coarse and sensual lines about his mouth  perceptible  upon all occasions  he might pass unnoticed among the thousands that  crowded daily the locality in which he lived  he was the general  jack  the army  he plotted  jack executed  and thus it was  that  through his  consummate cunning  they had both been enabled to avoid justice so  long  they ostensibly kept a sort of drinking saloon  from which they  professed to banish all disreputable characters  and which  through the  clear headedness of the one  and the awe in which the great personal  strength of the other was held  was unusually free from the disreputable  rows and scenes that generally characterize such places     if the kid and black jack differed from each other in personal  appearance  they were nearly if not quite as much opposed to each other  in dress  jack s attire was of the very coarsest description  and  always slovenly in appearance  no matter what the season of the year   he invariably wore a dark blue flannel shirt  a short  heavy over coat   with huge  deep pockets  thick  iron shod boots  coarse  loose trousers   and a huge  greasy  slouched  hat  of black felt  invariably pulled  over his eyes when out through the city  the only difference as to the  disposition of his attire  touching winter and summer  was  that during  the former season he always served his customers with his slouched hat  and jacket on  while throughout the warmest part of the latter  he  was invariably to be found behind his dark  dingy bar  with his shirt  sleeves tucked up and his collar unbuttoned and thrown open  displaying  a pair of huge  swarthy arms  covered with coarse  black hair  and  a broad and massive chest  presenting a similar aspect  and which  exhibited all the characteristics  in this connection  of the most  savage denizens of the forest  such  then  were the personal appearance  and the character of the two men whom lauder now visited by stealth from  time to time  but always in a disguise which defied detection  and which  was made up with the most consummate skill     unconscious of all the danger that surrounded her  kate still kept the  even tenor of her way  happy in the prospect of soon becoming the wife  of the man she loved  while barry  on the other hand  felt but little  apprehension as to any fears that she had expressed in relation to the  proximity of lander  believing  as he did  that she was totally beyond  his reach or power  and that his presence in buffalo was occasioned by  some business not in any degree connected with her  what  he argued  had  she to fear from any man whom she despised  and from whose society she  had deliberately and pointedly estranged herself  the days of feudal  abductions had passed away  and if in this practical age a woman refused  to become the wife of any man  she had a perfect right so to do  and  there the matter ended  besides  was she not beneath the roof of her own  relatives  who loved her with the sincerest warmth  and who were able to  protect her until she could claim the shelter of his own breast  as he  stood by her side the husband of her heart  all this went to reassure  him  so that when he sat down to reply to the letter which urged him to  procure his discharge at once  he wrote in the most cheering and happy  manner  bidding her to be of good heart  that she was safe from the  importunities and machinations of any individual who sought to gain her  affections  but intimating  at the same time  that he should at once  or  as soon as practicable  leave the army and as quickly as possible join  her on the other side of the great lakes     in the love that exists between two true irish hearts that have been  pledged to each other  deliberately and solemnly on the threshold of man  and womanhood  there is often something so confiding  so unreasoning  and so unselfish  as to put one in good humor with humanity  there is  no country on earth in which the love of gain intermixes with the  affections of the heart to so small an extent as in ireland  in this  relation we  from time to time  witness in the green isle such genuine  and grateful glimpses of the better phases of human nature  that  no  matter to what subsequent inconvenience and embarrassments they may  tend  they  for the time being  at least  charm us into a recognition  of something that is  after all  beautiful and truthful in our souls   except where the inexorable tyranny of birth creeps in  our matrimonial  alliances are  for the most part  purged of the cool calculation of  scotland  or the bread and beef considerations of the english  this may  be censurable in us  and doubtless it is  but  still  the charge  lies more against our heads than our hearts  it is a fact the most  indisputable  that in england most of the marriages in high or low life  are those of  convenance   while in ireland the contrary is the case   even the poorest irish girl in the land gives her hand only  where she  can bestow her heart  nor  as a general thing  can any amount of wealth  induce her to ignore her pride or affections in this connection  while   should her love be given to even the simplest peasant that ever stood by  her milking pail  she is totally beyond the reach of temptation  on the  part of both there is an out going of souls in this direction that  may be said to be peculiar to ireland  completely outside all physical  accidents and circumstances  there is a commingling of spirit which  ratifies a compact for all time  and lives in the future as well as the  present  stretching beyond the hoar  such souls are not dependent upon  mere personal contact or intercourse for the vitality of the passion  that animates them  for they are ever  en rapport  with each other   and clasped breast to breast wherever their individual physical  organizations may be  in this manner they bid defiance to fate and all  materiality  living on  undivided  and secure in the continuence of the  power that binds them to each other  such individualities become one  spiritually  all their aspirations are identical  all their sentiments  are the same  and so closely do they become united  that you cannot  destroy the one without destroying the other  we know and feel   beyond any shadow of doubt  that there are beings whose loss or total  annihilation we should be unable to survive  and if doomed to live   whose place could never be filled in our souls  throughout the endless  ages of eternity  hence the generous and beautiful  provision of the all  wise and all good  to every human heart  that interprets his laws aright  and conforms to his will  he presents that beautiful counterpart which   although mysteriously foreign  is yet  so delightfully and essentially   a part and parcel of our two fold nature     in no country in the world  then  does this divine law of natural  affinities prevail more than in ireland  and in no case had it ever been  more clearly illustrated than in the case of nicholas barry and kate  mccarthy  as each  if so inclined  could have sacrificed the other in  forming a matrimonial alliance respectively  identified with what was  believed  to be undoubted wealth  for the hand of kate  long before  she left her native land  there had been more than one suitor of means   while handsome nick  previous to his entering the army  was an object of  the warmest admiration on the part of many a damsel whose prospects were  of the most flattering description  but all to no purpose  not one of  the wealthy women was kate mccarthy in the one case  and not a single  well to do gentleman was nick barry  in the other  so this made all the  difference  and nick and kate  without pausing to cast their horoscope   gave themselves to each other  as already described  by the banks of  the shannon  a river whose bright murmuring waters have reflected more  beautiful eyes and manly forms than those of any other in europe  or  perhaps the world  without a thought for the future at the moment of  which we have already spoken  they plighted their faith for all time  and eternity  and well they kept their vows  although previous to the  arrival of nicholas in america  they had been upwards of three years  separated from each other the one leading the life of a soldier in a  sunny clime  and the other  on a far distant shore  hoping for the hour  when they should be once more side by side     when  however  our hero found himself the plighted lover of the being he  adored  and discovered himself simultaneously separated from her toy  the most cruel  unexpected and perverse fate  he bent  as previously  observed  every energy towards effecting his release from the bonds he  had assumed for her sake  he consequently  instead of wasting his hours  in sullen and useless repining  set actively to work and kept both his  mind and his body in a healthy condition  never losing confidence for a  moment  in his own ability to secure freedom or permitting the hope to  be shaken  that he should ultimately join the woman of his love in the  new world  and there realize an independence for both  and here we may  observe  that this feature in the character of nicholas was one of the  noblest and most dignified that could possibly distinguish any member of  the race to which we belong  the world has been lost to many a man  from  the fact of his not sitting down to look circumstances fairly in the  face  with a full determination to grapple with them and give them a  tussel for if wherever a good man and true places any reasonable  and legitimate object before him  no matter how dark the clouds that  surround him  in nine cases out often he achieves it  the grave error in  this connection is  that finding our inability to move the great mass  of our difficulties out of our road  en bloc  and at once  ignoring the  lesson taught by the constant drop that wears the stone  we sit down  overwhelmed  and never set sturdily about trying to remove it piecemeal   the most profusely illustrated lesson that heaven has yet taught to  man  is that of industry and perseverence  whether within the fragrant  chambers of the golden hive  or in the kingdoms of the busy ant  or mid  the curious nests that swing from forest boughs  we roam in thought   we find what perseverence can accomplish  and that too  by steps almost  imperceptible in themselves  it is the individual atoms that build up  the mighty and effective aggregate that overawes all opposition  and  like an avalanche sweeps all resistance before it  the loftiest pyramid  that throws its shadow over the desert to day  and that dwarfs at its  foot the beholder into the most incomparable insignificance  incapable  of being removed in fragments not larger than a pea  from its present  site to the other side of the globe  and the grandest structure ever  erected by human hands  has been built up from almost imperceptible  beginnings  into the imposing dimensions which so overshadow the admirer  and excite in his bosom feelings of almost superstitious awe  so that  look where we may  throughout the whole range of nature  of science or  of art  we find tee lesson of industry and perseverence inculcated in  the most impressive manner  and in a language that should reach and  influence our spirit struggles to the core     if less distinct than we have here delineated them  such were the  sentiments and convictions that influenced the actions and conduct of  our hero and heroine when fate had separated them  moved by the same  impulses  they both set about accomplishing the same end  and in the  same manner  barry s pen and kate s needle flew at intervals  and the  result  as already intimated  was  that each had accumulated a sum  sufficient to effect this release from the army  and that it now was to  be brought into requisition for the purpose of accomplishing that end     had nicholas been made of that sort of stuff which  with the  greatest possible degree of coolness  lays a friend or relative under  contribution  he might have been able  through its instrumentality  to  realize a sufficient sum to have taken him to america  at the  period that kate sailed  without having had recourse to the dreadful  alternative of enlisting in the english army  but not being built of  such questionable material  he bowed beneath the heavy yoke  believing   as he did  that however distasteful and derogatory to his feelings  it  was more honorable and independent to be indebted to himself  even at  so great a sacrifice  for the means of joining his beloved on the other  side of the atlantic  than to be constrained to traverse its trackless  waste  weighed down with the conviction  that  for the purpose of  accomplishing an object that could at least be honestly attained  otherwise  he had deprived those whom he had left behind of that of  which they themselves stood sorely in need  besides  he felt satisfied  from what he knew of himself  and the prospects open to even an  industrious soldier on the shores of canada  he should soon be able to  relieve himself of his bondage  and stand erect once more  freed from  the humiliation of the uniform he wore  but  as already seen  the fates  were against him in the first moments of his military career  and for  the time every fibre of his being was almost crushed beneath the most  frightful tension to which could have been possibly subjected  how  dreadful must have been the appalling intelligence of the countermand of  his regiment to the mediteranean  when it first fell upon his ear  and  how sufficient was the awful announcement to crush any ordinary mortal   yet  with the elasticity which is ever inseparable from a true and noble  spirit  when the first crash of the news bore him almost to the earth   he steadily began to brace himself against it  and ultimately  though by  slow and painful degrees  straightened himself beneath it  and  although  it was not the less heavy  stood erect under it at last  and bore it  squarely upon his shoulders     poor kate  although brave  too  had at first almost given up hope   when  a few days after her arrival at quebec  she learned the fatal  intelligence contained in the letter already referred to  but soon  perceiving  as he did  that nothing was to be achieved by useless  murmuring or hopeless inactivity  she shook herself  as free as her  strength would permit  from the dreadful incubus of the sorrow that  bowed her to the earth  and turned whatever talents she possessed to  good account  working night and day to accomplish the great and only  desire of her heart  and trusting to heaven for the rest  in this way  her constant and unwearied exertions lightened much of the load that  could not have failed under less favorable promptings  to have crushed  her completely  and have  in all human probability  consigned her to a  premature grave     and thus  we see  that these two brave young spirits had all but  accomplished the wish of their hearts  at the period at which our story  opens  and that they were now but simply awaiting the hour when nicholas  should be able to exchange the hated red jacket that he wore  for a  dress more in consonance with not only his own feelings  but those of  the being he so faithfully loved           chapter vi       whatever censure may be attached to any portion of the career of the  founders of fenianism  after the organization had become a recognized  power on both sides of the atlantic  we cannot divest ourselves of the  settled impression  that the men who were mainly instrumental in calling  it into existence and sustaining its infancy  were actuated by the  purest motives  to be sure  fenianism can scarcely be said to be the  embodiment of a new idea  or the exponent of new principles  but  then   there was a masterly grouping of energies and sentiments in connection  with it  which possessed the merit of originality  and which tended so  largely  not only to popularize it  but to give it a foothold on every  irish national hearthstone  in the selection of the name by which the  organization was to be distinguished  there was a clearness of judgment  as well as a thorough acquaintance with the necessities of the case   that cannot fail to strike any impartial observer  had the brotherhood  been organized under any commonplace appelation  or under any of  the various names that had characterized the previous revolutionary  societies of ireland  the probability is  it would have long since  fallen into line with those convivial associations  which content  themselves with an annual exposition of the grievances of ireland  over  the short leg of a turkey  a  bumper of burgundy   and that roar of  lip artillery  against the usurper  which dies away in a few maudlin  hiccups  about two o clock in the morning  to be revived only at the  expiration of another twelve months  under the burden of any commonplace  name  such  we say  might have been the fate of the organization ere  this  and so we regard the knowledge and genius which obviated the  possibility or rather the probability of failure in this relation  as  entitled to prominent consideration and respect  to the superficial  observer  this may appear of very little moment in connection with  a subject of such magnitude  but let it be understood  that we are  influenced by seeming trifles and the surface of things to an extent far  greater than we ourselves are willing to confess  notwithstanding the  oft repeated query   what s in a name   there is a great deal in a name   let two strangers  mr  harold bloomfield and mr  john smith send in  their cards together to an important official  of whom they expect to  get an audience separately  and the chances are nine out of ten in  favor of mr  bloomfield s being granted an interview first  this  we  apprehend  holds good in a thousand kindred instances  and in no way has  the supposition been more clearly verified than in relation to the name  bestowed upon the organization under consideration     the name  fenian  is of very remote antiquity  and appears to be most  comprehensive in its signification  and to be peculiarly adapted to  the great confraternity of patriots which now engrosses so much of the  history of passing events  there seems to be nothing sectional in it   it is national in the broadest sense of the term  and primative and  forcible to intensity  in some annotations to the annals of the four  masters we find that the ancient fenians were called by the irish  writers  fianna eirionn  signifying the fenians of ireland  and  mentioned under the name of fene  or feine  which  according to dr   o conor  signifies the phenicians of ireland  as feine  according to dr   o brien  in his dictionary  at the word fearmiugh  signifies phenicians   as they were probably called so from the tradition that phenicians came  to ireland in the early ages  they are also called by the irish writers   clann ua baois gine   and so named  according to keating and others   from baoisgine  who was chief commander of these warriors  and ancestor  of the famous hero fionn  the son of cumhall  but according to o conor   in his notes to the four masters  they were called baoisgine  as being  descended from the milesians who came from basconia  in spain  now  biscay  in the country anciently called cantabria  the fenian warriors  were a famous military force  forming the standing national militia  and  instituted in ireland in the early ages  long before the christian era   but brought  to the greatest perfection in the reign of the celebrated  cormac  monarch of ireland in the third century  none were admitted into  this military body but select men of the greatest activity  strength   stature  perfect form  and valor  and  when the force was complete  it  consisted of thirty five  catha   that is  battalions or legions  each  battalion containing three thousand men  according to o halloran and  various other historians  making twenty one thousand for each of the  five provinces  or about one hundred thousand fighting men in time of  war for the entire kingdom  the  ardrigh   or head king of ireland   had  for the time being  chief control over these forces  but they often  resisted his authority  a commander was appointed over every thousand  of these troops  and the entire force was completely armed and admirably  disciplined  and each battalion had their own bands of musicians and  bards to animate them in battle  and celebrate their feats of arms  in  the reign of the monarch cormac  the celebrated fionn maccumhaill   who was descended from the heremonian kings of leinster  was the chief  commander of the fenian warriors  and his great actions  strength  and valor are celebrated in the ossianic poems  and various other  productions of the ancient bards  he is called fingal in macpherson s  poems of ossian  but it is to be observed that these are not the real  poems of ossian  but mostly fictions fabricated by mac pherson himself   and containing some passages from the ancient poems  fionn had his chief  residence and fortress at almhuim  now either the hill of allen   near kildare  or ailinn  near old kilcullen  where a great rath still  remains  which was a residence of the ancient kings of leinster  the  fenians were the chief troops of leinster  and were milesians of the  race of heremon  and their renowned commander fionn  according to the  four masters  was slain by the cast of a javelin  or  according to  others  by the shot of an arrow  at a place called  ath brea   on the  river boyne  a d       the year before the battle of gaura  by the  lugnians of tara  a tribe who possessed the territory now called the  barony of lune  near tara  in meath  and the place mentioned as ath  brea  or the ford of brea  was situated somewhere on the boyne  between  trim and navan     in the reign of king cairbre liffeachair  son of the monarch cormac   the fenian forces revolted from the service of cairbre  and joined the  famous mogh corb  king of munster  of the race of the dalcassians  after  the death of fionn mac cumhaill  the fenians were commanded by his son  oisin or ossian  the celebrated warrior and bard  and at the time of  the battle of gaura  osgar  another famous champion  the son of oisin   commanded the fenian forces  the army of munster  commanded by mogh  corb  a name which signifies the chief of the chariot  and by his son  fear corb  that is  the man or warrior of the chariot  was composed of  the clanna deagha and dalcassian troops  joined by the fenians and their  leinster forces  and it is stated in the ossianic poems  and in hanmer s  chronicle  from the book of howth  that a great body of warriors from  north britain  denmark and norway  came over and fought on the side of  the fenians at gaura  the army of the monarch cairbre was composed  of the men of heath and ulster  together with the clanna morna  or  connaught warriors  commanded by aodh or hugh  king of connaught  son of  garadh  grandson of moraa of the damnonian race  the munster forces  and  fenians  marched to meath  where they were met by the combined troops of  the monarch cairbre  and fought one of the most furious battles recorded  in irish history  which continued throughout the whole length of a  summer s day  the greatest valor was displayed by the warriors on each  side  and it is difficult to say which army were victors or vanquished   the heroic osgar was slain in single combat by the valiant monarch  cairbre  but cairbre himself soon afterwards fell by the hand of  the champion simon  the son of ceirb  of the race of the fotharts of  leinster  both armies amounted to about fifty thousand men  the greatest  part of whom were slain  of the fenian forces  which consisted of twenty  thousand men  it is stated that eighteen thousand fell  and on both  sides  thirty thousand warriors were slain  in the following year   hugh  king of connaught  according to o flaherty s ogygia  defeated the  munsters forces in battle at spaltrach  near the mountain senchua  in  muscry  in which he slew mogh corb  king of munster  the tremendous  battle of gaura is considered to have led to the subsequent fall of  the irish monarchy  for after the destruction of the fenian forces  the  irish kings never were able to muster a national army equal in valor  and discipline to those heroes  either to cope with foreign foes  or to  reduce to subjection the rebellious provincial kings and princes  hence  the monarchy became weak and disorganized  and the ruling powers were  unable to maintain their authority or make a sufficient stand against  the danish and anglo norman invaders of after time     from what is here stated  it must be obvious  that no more appropriate  name than that of  fenian  could be given to the organization which now  holds the destiny of ireland in its hands  and which has ramified itself  throughout almost every portion of the habitable globe     we have already observed that the selection of this name was judicious  in more than one relation  in the first place  it was far removed from  that of any of the well known cognomens which had characterized so  many of the noted revolutionary associations that had already failed  in ireland  and  in this respect  was strong  being free from any  unpleasant reminiscences  while  from the fact of its import not being  generally known to the masses  it stimulated enquiry on the part of  the curious or weak nationalists which resulted in the most salutary  consequences  the rarity of the name led to newspaper expositions of it   and moved the inquiring patriot to look into irish history in relation  to it  and in this manner a knowledge of much of the ancient greatness  of ireland became the common property of those who were formerly but  slightly acquainted with such lore  the result was  thousands of the  irish became interested in relation to the past of their race  for  in  connection with this name there was that which was calculated to arouse  the spirit of patriotism within them and lead them on to a further  perusal of the annals of their country     it is evident  then  that no common appelation could have been fraught  with such beneficial results  as there would have been nothing connected  with it to stimulate enquiry or research  repealers  irish national  leagues  whiteboys  rockites  united irishmen   c   all had their  day  and carried their meaning upon the surface  so that it was really  necessary to give the new organization some occult  comprehensive and  characteristic name  that would separate it in this aspect from all  the irish revolutionary bodies that had preceded it  and place it   en rapport  with the great past of the nation which was the grand  receptacle of its traditions and source of its pride  here  then  we  leave this part of the subject  without presuming that we have thrown  much more light upon the matter than has already been recognized by  those who have at all looked into it  for it must  we think  be obvious  to most irish nationalists  that the energies and sentiments of their  patriotic countrymen  could never have been grouped so successfully  under any of the appelations just named  as they have been under that  of  fenians   given  as we have already perceived  to the great national  army of ireland during the days of her early glory and power  and which  alone represented the nation as a whole     it is not our province to dwell here upon the infancy of the  brotherhood on either side of the atlantic  or to enter into the various  difficulties and unpleasant circumstances to which it has been subjected  by alleged want of true patriotism and economy on the part of some  of its founders  sufficient to say  that through all such alleged  obstructions it has struggled into the greatest and most powerful  organization that has ever existed in any age of the world  and is   to day  the mightiest and most invincible floating power that has ever  influenced the destinies of any people  its friends are numbered by  millions and its members by hundreds upon hundreds of thousand  to its  ranks belong soldiers  statesmen and orators  men of large pecuniary  means and cultivated minds  cool heads and strong arms  and many guiding  spirits who need but little light save that which shines within them  in  addition  the sympathies of america and of every generous nation on the  face of the earth  are with it  so that it has triumphed in advance  in  a measure  for  backed by such influences  and actuated  as it is  by  impulses so pure and holy  not a solitary doubt can obtain in relation  to its ultimate success  true  that there are those who are thoughtless  or traitorous enough to designate it as antagonistic to religion  and  subversive  of the established order of things  but these  for the most  part  are persons who reason through their pockets or their prejudices   and who are devoid of any thorough recognition of those great principles  which are applicable to nations as well as to individuals and which are  based upon the just doctrine  that resistence to tyrants is obedience to  god  persons who are so methodical and patient under the sufferings of   others   that they would pause to measure the precise length of rope  that  was necessary to reach a drowning man  in the day of ireland s  triumph  such people  will cone to confusion  as will those who have  withheld from her  in the period of her sore travail  the pecuniary aid   which they could have well afforded out of their ample means  with a  view to relieving their kinsmen and suffering fellow countrymen from the  grasp of a tyrant the most inexorable that ever drew breath     were the fenian organization confined entirely to ireland  and did no  active outside sympathy obtain for that unfortunate country the day of  her redemption might be postponed to an indefinite period  so completely  are all the resources and defences of the land in the hands of the  english  that it would be difficult for the natives to make any  lengthened or effective stand against the usurper  england has her   navy and her army to operate against any rising of the inhabitants  at  a moment s warning  while every office in the kingdom  of the slightest  importance or trust  is in the hands of her minions  again  among some  of the recreant sons of the soil  she has  alas too ample scope for the  use of her accursed gold  and thus it is  that to cope singled handed  with her against such fearful odds  would involve oceans of blood  both  on the field and on the scaffold  when  however  we come to dwell on  the fact  that outside and beyond her control or reach  another body  of irish  which has been aptly termed a nation within a nation  when  it comes to be understood  we say  that on the shores of free america a  mighty and invincible brotherhood has been built up  actuated by every  sentiment of hostility which fires the breast of the most implacable of  her enemies to day  and that has for its aim and end an object in common  with the people of ireland at her own doors  then we begin to perceive  how harrassed and powerless she must be  neither her famine  fire  nor sword  can avail her here  secure beneath the ample folds of the  glorious stars and stripes of the great republic of america  and fired  with the love of free institutions  and taught in the great principles  of freedom by the liberty loving american people  this mighty band of  exiles  in connection with their children born beneath the folds of the  american flag  are steadily preparing to join fierce issue with her and  test  upon the open field  the prowess she has so often set forth as  superior to that of any other nation  this is what now disables and  paralyses her  ireland is  for the time being  beneath her heel  but  what of the warlike hosts that loom in the western horizon and may soon  rush down on her like a wolf on the fold  and wedge her in between two  hostile walls  this is the great strength  of ireland at the present  moment  her energies are not walled in by the ocean or a british fleet  she is alive and active in other lands  and so powerful outside her own  borders  that there is no such thing as circumscribing her influence or  operations in so far as they relate to her struggles for independence   it is  then  from america that she is to obtain her most effective aid   and such being the case  it behooves the irish nationalists on american  soil to be true and steady to the great purpose in which they are now so  ardently engaged  for so far  fortune has smiled upon them  the american  people sympathize with them and feel that while they are aiding them to  regain the long lost freedom of their country  they are bringing to  the dust the very self same enemy that sought  by stealth and the most  cowardly means  to overthrow their own commonwealth  and leave the union  a hopeless ruin before the world  it is this which now hangs a millstone  about the neck of the british government  and which must ultimately  develope itself in active sympathy with any people who have for their  object the humiliation of the skull and cross bones of st  george  on  this side of the atlantic at least     and so the ball rolls  hourly accumulating force and magnitude  and  destined  at no distant day  to sweep in upon ireland and hurl the  invader from her shores  no power on earth can stay its onward course   the freedom of ireland is the creed of millions  the young lisp it   strong men repeat it in every clime  and the old of both hemispheres  murmur it in their prayers  in short  it has taken a hold of the irish  heart wherever a true pulse warms it to day  and has so incorporated  itself with the hopes and aspirations of the irish of all lands  that  fate itself must yield to its power and universality  within the last  few years it has become part and parcel of the education of the irish  people wherever they are found  whether beneath the burning zone  in  temperate latitudes or at the frozen poles  so that its ultimate success  is beyond any possible contingency  from the fact that there never was a  sentiment so widely spread and so religiously cultivated and cherished   that failed to accomplish all that it would attain           chapter vii       while the children of ireland were engaged in defending the flag of  the union during the late civil war  and sealing with their blood their  fidelity to the great republic  they were  also  acquiring a knowledge  of arms and a warlike hardihood  which tended  on the cessation of  hostilities  to render the fenian organization more formidable than  it could possibly have become  had peace pervaded the land from the  inception of the brotherhood to its triumph at ridgeway  all through  this gigantic struggle the hand of the irish patriot and exile was  prominently observable  not a field had been fought from the firing of  the first gun at fort sumter to the surrender of lee s army  on which  their blood had not flowed in rivers  look at murfreesboro  corinth   perrysville  iuka  antietam  chickahomany  winchester  fort donaldson   island ten  shiloh  lexington  bull run  carnifex ferry  the  rappahannock  the mississippi  the cumberland  the potomac and  fredericksburg   where one half of meagher s brigade are still encamped   under the sod    and we have evidence of the truth of this assertion   the most ample and complete  amidst these scenes of terrific  carnage  the warlike genius and matchless personal bravery of many a  distinguished irishman were eminently conspicuous  while the latent  fires that had previously lain dormant in the breast of others  leaped  forth into a glorious conflagration  that commanded the admiration of  every true soldier and evoked the recognition of the commonwealth  at large  amongst this latter class stood pre eminently forward   the present president of the fenian brotherhood throughout the  world  general john o niell  a brief sketch of whom we introduce here  for obvious reasons  drawn from authentic records in our possession  as  well as from the current newspaper literature of the day      to the irish reader   observes a contemporary  well informed upon  this subject   and especially to that portion of our people  who are  conversant with the past history of their country  and feel a patriotic  pride in its glorious records  as well as a fervent hope for their  renewal in the future  there is no name fraught with memories more  inspiring than that of o neill  the princely house of ulster  the  champions of the red hand  who  for centuries  in the struggles of  the nation against the saxon invader  led the hosts of their people  to victory  and only succumbed at last when poison and treachery  and  chicane had accomplished what force failed to effect  for their valor  was powerless against the dagger of the assassin  as were their honesty  and open heartedness against the bad faith of england s perjured tools   like many a noble and ancient irish house  its scions are to day to be  found scattered through the world  in every walk of life  but though its  banner no longer floats over embattled hosts  there is magic still in  its associations  and when men speak of the o neill  the irish heart  leaps fondly towards the historic name and the proud recollection of the  days when hugh and owen stood for the rights of their people and native  land  and dealt the assailants of both those sturdy blows which so well  justified their claim to the blazon of the  red hand       in our own day  too  the old blood has vindicated its inherent force  and purity  and has found a worthy representative in the subject of our  present sketch  general john o neill   whose name  in the future history  of the irish race  will be as inseparably linked with the struggles of  the present generation for national independence  as are those of  his ancestors with the efforts made by our people in the past against  english tyranny and usurpation  as this noble and patriotic irishman is  now occupying so much of the public attention  and his political conduct  meeting with that cordial endorsement which is a just tribute to his  bravery and patriotism  whether on the bloody fields of the south   routing a morgan  or assuming the command of his colonel  or  with  thirty men repelling the attack of a regiment  or  with his gallant band  of irish soldiers  chasing the  queen s own  at ridgeway  a brief  review of his career will not be devoid of interest to all who desire  to preserve a record of those who have deserved well of their country   within the limits of such a sketch it would be impossible to do adequate  justice to the character of a man like general o neill  and we can only  assume to glance at the many attestations of his bravery and gentlemanly  bearing which should have a public record  as they are from men of high  position  and are of importance in illustrating the estimation in which  he has always been held by his superior and brother officers  no man can  produce a more unsullied one  or one better calculated to confirm his  title to the high position in which his countrymen have placed him      general o neill was born on the  th of march        in the townland of  drumgallon  parish of clontibret  county monaghan  ireland  at his birth  he was an orphan  his father having died a few weeks previously  the  early part of his existence was spent with his grandparents in his  native place  bred up in a country  every hill and river and plain of  which was linked in story with the deeds of the mighty men of old  it is  not to be wondered at that the mind of young o neill seized with avidity  every incident of the past connected with the condition and history of  his fatherland  or that the bias of his future life was given by his  meditations as he rambled along the slopes of benburb  or traced the  victorious steps of his ancient sept  through the classic region where  his schoolboy days were passed  that it should be so is only natural   for he is a kinsman  as well as namesake  of the great hugh o neill who   with his fearless followers  swept over ulster and defeated so many of  england s greatest generals  and brought the heads of some of her pets  to the block  and there is no doubt but that some of her favorites of  to day shall be made to bite the dust ere the general has done with  them      general o neill is a man of calm temperament  but a firm will  which   when excited  however  is stern and inflexible  uniting with this a good  education and gentlemanly address  with a mind bold  independent and  decisive  his person partakes of the character of his mind for if the  one never succumbed in the council  the other never bent in the field   few could imagine from his modest exterior the latent  fire and energy  which burn in his bosom  his manner is as unassuming as his mind is  noble  quiet  yet impervious to flattery or laudations  he seems at the  same time to pay due regard to popular opinion  without in the least  permitting it to influence him in the discharge of his duties      while he was yet quite young  the family of general o neill emigrated  to the united states  and his mother settled at elizabeth  n j   where  she still resides  he did not follow them until       when he was  fourteen years of age  having devoted some time to the completion of his  studies here  he determined to engage in commercial pursuits  and for  some time travelled as agent for some of the leading catholic publishing  houses  in      he opened a catholic book store in richmond  va   and  while residing there became a member of the  emmet guard   then  the leading irish organization in that section of the country  the  inclination thus manifested for the military profession soon proved to  be the ruling passion in the mind of the young celt   checked only by  the repugnance of his family towards the soldier s life  for  in        he gave up his business and entered the second regiment of u s   cavalry  a regiment which has since furnished the most distinguished  officers who have figured on both sides during the late war      in the regular army  o neill rose steadily by his good character   bravery and aptitude  no less than by his education and invariable  gentlemanly conduct  but though he has since filled positions of high  responsibility  he has often declared that one of the most pleasurable  emotions of his life was experienced when  for some meritorious act  he  received  from his commanding officer  his warrant of corporal      at the outbreak of the war  the regiment with which he was serving  was recalled from california  and on the organization of the army under  mcclellan  was attached to the regular cavalry division  which took part  in the principal battles in the campaign of the peninsula  during  which o neill was in command of gen  stoneman s body guard  after the  withdrawal of the army from the peninsula  he was dispatched to indiana   where he was retained for some time as instructor of cavalry  drilling  the officers of the force then being raised for the defence of  that portion of the union against the incursions of the confederate  guerillas  he subsequently entered the  th indiana cavalry as second  lieutenant  and served with that regiment  during       in the  operations against the southern leaders in kentucky  tennessee  indiana  and ohio  in these expeditions  which  whether in the nature of scouts   reconnoisances or advances  generally took the shape of sharp running  fights  lieut  o neill s skill and daring not only attracted the  attention of his commanding officers  but further enlisted the  enthusiasm of the men  insomuch that  when one of those  sorties   was ordered  the first question asked was always   is o neill to lead  it    and if the answer was in the affirmative  no matter how jaded the  men might be  volunteers in any number were ready at once      there is no greater instance of personal bravery  or gallantry equal to  any emergency  than that related by archbishop purcell  of cincinnati   in his account of o neill s encounter with morgan  the famous guerilla   and as many of our readers have not read the partial account given in  mr  savage s  fenian heroes and martyrs   it may prove of interest to  them  as his encounter with morgan is more generally spoken of than  understood  archbishop purcell says        there is a remarkably brave officer suffering from diarrhoea   contracted in a three month s chase after morgan  now in st  john s  hospital  in this city  lieut  o neill  of the  th indiana cavalry  his  mother resides in elizabeth  new jersey  her adventurous boy enlisted  in the regular army at the time of the mormon excitement in utah  was  afterwards sent to california  was made sergeant for distinguished  services on the potomac  employed on a recruiting tour in indiana  and  promoted to a lieutenancy in the famous  th indiana cavalry      respecting his encounter with hamilton s rebel force  in may  the  indianapolis papers spoke of the exploit of lieut  o neill  and a  detachment of his company  as one of the most daring and brilliant  achievements of the war  the lieutenant has kindly furnished us with  the following interesting account of the part he took in the defeat of  morgan  the authorities here have recommended him for promotion to the  rank of major      incidents of the fight with morgan  at buffington s island  on the   th  of july      on the night of the   th  about    o clock  gen  judah  with his  cavalry and artillery command  left pomeroy for buffington  the general  sent first lieutenant john o neill  of the  th indiana cavalry  with  fifty men  ahead  with instructions to try and open communications with  the militia  said to be in close proximity to the island  the lieutenant  was delayed by losing the road during the night  and did not arrive  till about an hour and a half after daylight  he then learned that the  militia had been skirmishing with the enemy during the night  and that  gen  judah s advance had been ambushed  the morning being foggy  and the  general s assistant adjutant general  capt  rice  with some twenty five  or thirty men and a piece of artillery  and chief of artillery  capt   henshaw  had been captured and sent to gen  morgan s headquarters on the  river road  some thirty miles ahead of him  on the enemy s left flank   the lieutenant at once resolved to recapture what had been taken  and   with his spartan band  kept steadily on  several parties tried to stop  him  but a volley from the  sharp s  carbines of his boys invariably  drove them back  at length he came on morgan  with two regiments and a  body guard of one hundred men  the lieutenant halted his men suddenly   at an angle of the road  within one hundred and fifty paces  he gave the  command  ready   and intended to have given them a volley  but seeing  some of his own men in front  he did not fire  but commanded  forward    and dashed in amongst them  if he had fired  every shot must have told   he was so close  morgan  with his two regiments and body guard  ran  without firing a shot  all our prisoners were released  and about thirty  of the enemy taken  some were killed and wounded  the lieutenant pursued  morgan about two miles clear off the field  and captured three pieces of  artillery  which he carried off with him  this was the last of morgan on  the field  the lieutenant cannot tell how many he killed or wounded  as  his fight was a running one  extending over four miles  but the surgeon  in charge of burying the dead and looking after the wounded  reported  that most of both were along the river where o neill had been       the above  from archbishop purcell  is an unquestionable testimony of  the daring and audacity of the subject of this sketch in the field  the   national journal   in giving an account of the same battle  says      lieutenant o neill  of the  th indiana cavalry  now appeared by  another road  with but fifty men  and charged two different regiments so  desperately that they broke and left our captured guns  officers and men  in our possession       the  louisville journal   after relating an instance of o neill s  personal bravery  says      lieutenant o neill is the same who  about two weeks ago  while out with  col  graham  on the tennessee side of cumberland  with twenty men as an  advanced guard  came up with hamilton  having two hundred men drawn  up in line  charged and ran him thirteen miles  and with his own hand   while ahead of his men  killed five  two of them with the sabre       to go into detail  and give a minute account of the many instances  of gallantry  pluck and determination displayed by the subject of our  sketch  would be beyond the scope of our present purpose  as they  at  the same time  would only tend to multiply instances  without lending  any additional proof  but we cannot  as it directly bears on his  letter of resignation  with accompanying letters of endorsement from  distinguished generals  pass over that singular and noble proof of  unexampled bravery  his assuming the command of his colonel butler  when  the latter showed signs of cowardice      the affair took place at walker s ford  on clinch river  in east  tennessee  where the division to which o neill s regiment was attached  was stationed  to dispute the passage of the southern troops  which in  large force occupied the adjacent country  o neill had only a few days  before rejoined his command  after the illness incurred in his chase  after morgan  and was at breakfast when the alarm was given that the  enemy had surprised the advanced guard  and were attacking in force   springing on his horse  he rallied the company of picked men he  commanded  and for a long time held the advancing forces of the enemy  in check  to give time for others to form line of battle  but the enemy  were rapidly getting in rear of the union troops  and o neill fell back  on the main body of his regiment  just in time to hear his colonel cry  out   oh  god  all is lost  save yourselves  men  the best way you can   nothing is left us but retreat    not by a long sight   shouted o neill   as  sword in hand  he dashed in front of the mob of soldiers  upon whom  panic and the example of their commander were rapidly doing the work of  disorganization   men   continued he  turning to them   all of you who  mean to  fight   fall in with me   the effect was almost miraculous   about one hundred and fifty of the fugitives rallied  and with these  he drove back the advancing columns of the enemy  saved the day  and   though severely wounded in the action  remained master of the field      of this attack  a correspondent of the indianapolis  daily journal   of  january        says      the rebels  finding we were retreating  determined to drive us into  the river  about three hundred mounted men came over the hills  charging  company  a     th indiana  and three companies of the  th  commanded by  col  butler and capt  hodge  our boys began to waver  the colonel tried  to rally them to no effect  when o neill rode up and took command   taking a henry rifle from one of the   th boys  he commenced firing   at the same time yelling at the men to charge them  which they did   for about five minutes it was the most frightful scene i have ever  witnessed  out of the three hundred confederates  only about  twenty   went back mounted  the balance being killed  wounded  and dismounted  a  rebel officer  afterwards taken  admitted the loss of twenty killed  and forty wounded in the charge  this so effectually checked them  and  convinced them that a charge would not pay  that we very easily held our  ground until the wagons and guns had crossed the river  but our brave  lieutenant  o neill  received a wound in the thigh while we were making  our last stand  he rode out all day  never seeking shelter  cheering his  men  when other officers had given up all as lost  he replied   not by  a long sight   he met with a hearty response from the men  we afterwards  learned that we were fighting three brigades  among them the  texan  rangers        there is no nobler instance of daring or pluck  or of presence of mind   or decisiveness of character  equal to any crisis  than this  but what  is the sequel  the colonel  narrow minded as he was cowardly  was piqued  at young o neill s gallantry in repelling the attack  which at once  stamped himself with cowardice  and lowered him  as a consequence   in the estimation of his brother officers  after the battle he sent a  report of the officers and non commissioned officers whom he recommended  for promotion   omitting the name of o neill   this was a direct insult  to the man who displayed the most bravery  and had saved them from  a watery grave  a fiery death  or  worse than all  an ignominious  surrender  it at once aroused all that was stern in his nature  to have  such a coward offer him an insult  he went to the colonel  and demanded  if it was true that he had sent the names of certain officers to the  governor for promotion  and noncommissioned officers for commissions  over him  and omitted his name altogether  the colonel replied in the  affirmative   then   said o neill   i shall never serve another day in  your regiment       we give these particulars in detail  as well as his resignation   not only on account of its boldness  but as some people try to put a  different construction on the fact of his sending in his resignation at  that time  conformably with his determination  he went to his quarters   where  after a fortnight  he prepared his resignation  and sent it to  headquarters  in the interim  the colonel sent one day to know if he  would drill the regiment  o neill sent back to know if it was an order  or a request  on being assured it was the latter  he complied  he was  expecting to be arrested every day  but the colonel was too much of a  coward  as he was afraid the consequences would be rather unpleasant   after a few weeks  his resignation was sent to headquarters  with  letters of disapproval  but endorsing his complaints  and testifying to  his bravery and efficiency  from gens  sturges and stoneman  comments  on these letters would be superfluous  as they speak forcibly for  themselves        camp near paris  kentucky  april  th              sir  i

with others from the present colonel of my regiment  and    the former  colonel graham  recommending me to governor morton  for    the position of field officer in one of the regiments being    organized in indiana  will show that i am not undeserving of    promotion in my own regiment  and that i have some cause to be    dissatisfied with not receiving it  and with having officers placed    over me whom  in point of military knowledge and experience  i    cannot regard as my superiors        i certify  on honor  that i am not indebted to the united states    on any account whatever  and

in the  th indiana cavalry over the heads of superiors  based upon    political or other considerations  and altogether regardless of    merit  by this system junior and meritorious officers find    themselves cut off from all hope of advancement  and compelled to    serve subordinate to others for whose qualifications they can    entertain no respect        while  therefore  i disapprove his

to renew the good old fight for loved erin s disenthralment  no matter  whether on the field or in the drawing room  his calmness of deportment  and gentlemanly bearing are the same  the simplest child he would no  more offend than the most powerful man  uniting with such gentleness and  heroic bravery  precise military knowledge  and a pure patriotism  may  not irishmen hope that in him they have found the man who is destined to  lead them on to victory and liberty  in whatever sphere he moves  he is  universally endeared to all  for       in him is the heart of a woman  combined     with a heroic life and a governing mind       in the movement on canada  in       gen  o neill sacrificed a business  which  in a few years  would have made him a wealthy man  but he did so  without hesitation  for he loved his country  and had pledged his life  to her service  with the contingent raised by him in tennessee  he  proceeded to buffalo  where  finding himself the senior officer  he  assumed command of the troops there assembled  and  in obedience to the  orders he had received  crossed the niagara river  at the head of six  hundred men  on the night of the   st of may  and raised the green flag  once more on the soil of the enemy  on the following evening  receiving  information that the british forces were marching against him to the  number of five thousand  in two distinct columns  he resolved to fight  them in detail  and by a rapid march got between them  on the morning  of the  d of june  at ridgeway  he struck them under booker  and  though  the enemy out numbered his force  four to one   routed them signally   falling back on his original position at fort erie  he there learned  that the united states government had stopped the movement at other  points  and arrested its leaders  under the circumstances  nothing more  could be done  at that time  and he was reluctantly obliged to re cross  the niagara  and surrender to the united states forces  that he only  did so under the pressure of necessity  is attested by his offer to the  committee in buffalo to hold his ground  as his own report of the battle  of ridgeway attests  in which he simply says      but if a movement was going on elsewhere  i was perfectly willing to  make the old fort a slaughter pen  which i knew it would be the next day  if i remained   for i would never have surrendered        at the cleveland convention of the fenian brotherhood  in september         general o neill was elected a senator of that body  and having  been chosen vice president on the resignation of that office by james  gibbons  esq   he succeeded president w r  roberts  on the resignation  of that gentleman  dec                we have thus briefly sketched the principal incidents of general  o neill s career  and  in conclusion  may venture to say that a more  stainless  or meritorious  could scarcely be presented to the public   his whole history incontrovertibly illustrates as noble  determined and  daring a character as ever led a brave but enslaved people to victory      we could supplement this with various other official documents and  accounts  serving  if such were possible  to illustrate still further  the proud daring and exalted spirit of this worthy son of an illustrious  past  but shall  at this particular point of our story  content  ourselves with what has just been said  we might  were we so inclined   introduce  also  various other irish names that shone forth with  unrivalled splendor during the late war  and point to the thousands  upon thousands of irish rank and file that  on numerous fields  piled up  ramparts of dead around the glorious flag of the union  but such would  not serve our purpose here  as we are restricted in relation to the task  before us  and as the fact of the exploits and the bravery of hosts  of our loyal countrymen are known to the government and people of this  republic  sufficient to say  however  that amongst all those of our race  who fought and bled in defence of the north  and the integrity of the  commonwealth  there was not to be found one individual who evinced more  profound judgment than he in handling the forces at his command  or  more cool daring  or instances of personal bravery  as well as that  tremendous and overwhelming dash  which gained for ney the proud  appellation   the bravest of the brave   and placed the marshals of  france amongst the foremost in history      from out of this fierce civil contest  then  it is obvious from all  that we have just said  that fenianism  in its military aspect  received  the largest and most important accessions  at the close of the conflict   thousands upon thousands of veterans joined its standard  and thus  in  an incredibly short period  its warlike character became intensified   until  at last  the organization on the american continent loomed up  before england with an aspect so threatening and a purpose so apparent   that she instantly set about putting her house in order  and began  to glance in the direction of making some cunning  though paltry   concessions to ireland      if  however  the military circles of the brotherhood were distinguished  by the accession of many brave and patriotic soldiers  at the juncture  already referred to  the organization  in its civil aspect  was not  less fortunate or noticeable  led triumphantly through some of the most  difficult phases of its existence  by such self sacrificing and noble  patriots as colonel w r  roberts  of new york  its late president  and  james gibbons  esq   of philadelphia  its present vice president  than  whom two more disinterested and sterling sons of the sod do not  exist  its basis enlarged and strengthened  we say  by such men as  these  and the able and truehearted senators that surrounded them  the  brotherhood  at the close of the war  was in a condition sufficiently  exalted to attract to its centre many of the ablest soldiers who had  fought on the side of the union  and who  with their numerous and  respective followings  were ready to evince their love of liberty and  republican institutions further  by resuming their swords and striking  home for the freedom of poor  down trodden ireland  against a tyrant the  most infamous that has ever existed  and to whom america owes a debt  of vengeance  that  under any circumstances  cannot fail to be one day  repaid with tenfold interest      and so this grand confraternity of patriots prospered and became the  greatest and most powerful that has ever appeared upon the theatre of  human existence  to be sure  in a body so numerous and all but ramified  throughout every portion of the habitable globe  there have been some  unworthy members  who fell before the love of gain  or british gold   but  then  and with pride we say it  taking the gigantic proportions of  the organization into consideration  and the temptations to sin which  have been so constantly placed before it by that blood thirsty assassin   england  it stands  by comparison  pre eminently pure above any other  similar revolutionary body that has ever obtained in either hemisphere   or in any age of the world  up to the present hour  under the protection  and guidance of a divine providence  it has surmounted every difficulty  that has beset it  it has outlived whatever of treason or mismanagement  obtained in its own bosom  it has survived the cruel calumnies and  falsehoods of a traitorous and subsidized press  and the machinations of  that dangerous english element that sometimes steals into high places   and which has so often interfered with the true interests of america  within her own borders  as well as touching her foreign relations  these  and many either untoward influences it has surmounted  until  now  it  stands upon a pedestal beyond the reach of danger  not only from  its great inherent strength and virtue  but from its all but  incomprehensible ubiquity  and positive existence in every land and  clime  how futile  then  the efforts of its enemies to crush it either  by ungenerous legislation  or through the propagation of falsehood   fenianism is a power founded upon the immutable principles of truth and  justice  and is  therefore  indestructible  consequently  until it has  achieved the grand and holy objects that it has set before it  it must  win its way to triumph  step by step  if needs be no matter what the  magnitude or the number of the difficulties that beset it            chapter viii       early as barry was up on the morning following his introduction to the  reader  he found tom and greaves in the bar room  discussing one of  o brien s favorite decoctions  which was averred to possess the virtue  of giving a  fillip  to the lagging appetite  and attuning it to the  healthiest possible breakfast pitch  nicholas  although not addicted  to early potations  was prevailed upon to join the party  during  the  friendly conversation which accompanied this faithless libation to the  goddess of health  greaves observed that while he did not feel himself  at liberty to speak freely in the mixed company of the preceding  evening  notwithstanding what might have been termed his unfriendly  insinuations in relation to ireland  he was himself a true friend of  irish freedom  and  on all befitting occasions  an humble champion of  her total and unequivocal independence of england  here he produced a  letter  from a secret pocket in the lining of his vest  which he handed  to tom for hasty perusal  remarking  at the same time  that he well knew  to whom he was submitting it  a hurried glance at the contents induced  o brien to open his eyes wider than they had been opened for some time   and to regard his companion with an almost bewildered stare      sure enough  it s his handwritin  and it s as thrue as the sun    ejaculated tom  as he folded up the letter and returned it to the owner    and it s a different opinion both nick and myself had of you last  night  although sorry i am for it now  and there s my hand for you       what s up now   retorted barry  well knowing that o brien would never  have offered his hand to greaves  unless there were good reasons for it      nothin  more   returned tom   beyond that we had formed a wrong opinion  of our frind here  last night  for  instead of his bein  what i was  half inclined to take him for  he cannot fail to be other than the right  stamp  or he never could have that letther in his pocket       that s enough for me  tom   replied barry  extending his hand to  greaves   for whoever you endorse is sure to pass muster  in this place   at least      the conversation here became low and confidential  being interrupted  only by an occasional customer who dropped in to take his  morning    until  at last  breakfast was announced  and the soldier and greaves   taking the hint  were soon snugly seated side by side in the little  parlor of the preceding night  at a neat and comfortable table  smoking  with some of the good things which so constantly characterized the  harp  o brien  from his other avocations  was unable to join them at  the moment  so they both conversed freely on the topic that had just  commanded their attention in the bar  and which referred to neither more  nor less than the intended invasion of canada by the army of the irish  republic  then said to be preparing for a descent upon the provinces   in the neighboring union  nicholas was unable to give any definite  information upon the matter  as the authorities of the organization in  the united states were very reticent regarding it  and greaves himself  appeared but little better informed  barry  however  expressed the  opinion that  if any man in canada had thorough information on the  point  it was tom  although he himself had no very tangible grounds for  making the observation  notwithstanding the strength of his surmises      do you not belong to the organization yourself  and if you do   ought you not to be in possession of some facts on this all important  movement   rejoined greaves   and if you are not a member  surely you  are sufficiently true to ireland to have been informed  to some extent  at least  in regard to it  by your friend o brien  who is  i learn  a  centre here       well  strange as it may appear   returned the other   i don t belong to  the brotherhood  not having  yet had an opportunity to join it  and  as for tom  whatever my suspicions may be  i really am unable to say  positively that he is in any degree connected with the organization   although i am sensible that his sympathies  like my own  lie in that  direction       how is your regiment situated on this point   remarked greaves   leisurely breaking an egg and commencing to chip the shell      a good many of my way of thinking   replied the other   but  as you  know  it is necessary to be cautious  as not only is the commanding  officer a tartar  but most of the swords and sashes are of the same  kidney  the fact of the case is  however  several of our fellows have  deserted  and no doubt will join the organization in the states  and  render good service to the cause there  in a military point of view       why don t you follow their example and do something for your poor   down trodden country   said philip in reply   seeing that now is the  time she needs the service of all her children       there is no necessity for my deserting   rejoined barry   for i have  already applied for my discharge  which i expect to receive this  very day  so that ere the sun sets  in all probability  i shall be a  freeman      greaves became silent here for a few moments  as if revolving something  in his mind  when  lifting his head again  he resumed the conversation  by asking      are strangers permitted to visit the fort  if so  i should be very glad  to take a peep at it this morning  as i shall have a few boars to spare  before i can do any business  or rather before the parties i have come  to see will be prepared to meet me       why  not as a general thing  just now   returned nicholas   but i think  you may be able to gain admittance if you are accompanied by me  who  will  of course  vouch to the sentry for you       then if you allow me   said greaves   i shall avail myself of your kind  invitation  and cross the bridge with you after we have breakfasted  for  i can well imagine that during a period when such rumors are afloat  the  commandant as rather chary of permitting strangers to enter his gates      in this strain the conversation flowed until breakfast was ended  when  the friends proposed to sally forth from the harp  and wend their way to  the point already mentioned  as barry was leaving the bar room  however   tom whispered something in his ear  which appeared to puzzle him for a  moment  but returning a keen glance of recognition  both he and greaves  passed out into the cool  fresh morning air  and began slowly wending  their way to the fort     there being as yet no special order about the admission of strangers   greaves  with nicholas by his side  passed the sentry without question   and proceeded to the canteen  which  early as it was  showed some signs  of life  here barry introduced his new acquaintance to many of his  comrades  but in such common place terms  as to attract no attention  whatever on the part of any person  being for parade  however  he was  obliged to leave his friend in other keeping  for a short period  and so  hastened to the barrack room to prepare himself for his morning duties   during the interval of his absence  greaves stepped out of the canteen   alone  and learning that the colonel was speaking to some of the  officers near the parade ground  made his way towards where the group  was standing  and crossing the path of the colonel as he was walking  towards his quarters  accosted him in a manner which soon arrested the  progress and attention of that officer  and brought him to a dead halt   the conversation was brief and rapid  while a slip of paper thrust into  the hands of the colonel  by greaves  seemed to place both on a strange  footing of recognition  so brief was the interview  that it was not  observed by any individual in the garrison  and so quickly did greaves  return to the canteen  that his absence was scarcely noticed  here barry  found him as he had left him  making himself agreeable to the soldiers   being more than liberal in paying for all they drank  as the bugle  sounded for parade  he bid our young hero  good bye for the present    and leaving the fort  proceeded to retrace his steps towards the town   or city  as it may be called     when he arrived here  instead of returning to the harp  he bent his  steps in another direction  and entered a hotel that was in every  relation the very antipodes of the establishment in which he had passed  the night  here  in every direction  were to be found the traces of an  english spirit and blind adhesion to wretched and exploded traditions   in the office hung the portrait of the cruel queen of england  and that  of her defunct consort  whose injustice and pedantry were so snubbed  by the illustrious humboldt  here  too  were to be seen the likeness  of the  iron hearted  it should have been  duke  presenting a birth day  present  or something of the sort  to a moonfaced yonker that sat fair  and plump upon the knee of its royal mother  in another corner was to be  found a representation of the prince of wales  for whose head and  face the engraver had done infinitely more than nature  while directly  opposite stood  in a dark  heavy frame  the one armed hero of the nile   who owed so much of his fame to poor emma harte  the unfortunate lady  hamilton  who  after having conferred the most serious benefits upon  england  was permitted to starve  with her daughter  in a garret  somewhere in or near calais  while some of the spurious offspring of  orange and ballet girls filled many of the highest offices in the land  she had so often served     in this establishment the subject of fenianism was discussed as a  leading topic  in a manner quite different from the style in which it  was treated at the harp  here no voice was raised in its favor  no word  of justification advanced in its behalf  still  although its importance  was ignored ostensibly  there were a nervousness and misgiving about  some of those who conversed upon it  which showed that they were ill at  ease  there seemed  in addition  to be some vague sense of insecurity  preying upon them  which could only have originated in their want of  confidence in themselves  or in some person or persons to whom were  entrusted the gravest interests of the province  this was the more  obvious  from the fact  that  from time to time  mysterious and  half whispered enquiries were made  in reference to one particular  individual  whose state of health or mind seemed at the moment to  engross no ordinary share of the attention of the numerous guests that  filled the bar or office  for the apartment was used as both     greaves listened with open ears to all that transpired  and  after  inspecting the hotel register  took up a morning paper and seated  himself in an arm chair at his side  while engaged  as he feigned to  be  in perusing the news  although actually endeavoring to catch every  whisper that floated around him  he gathered  that  for the week or  ten days proceeding  one of the most important functionaries in the  province  who  although a clever man  was sorely addicted to fits of  intemperence  was now  while the country was convulsed with gloomy  forebodings  regarding fenianism  again passing through one of his  prolonged and fearful drinking bouts  and totally unfit to pay even the  slightest attention to the momentous business of his office  already  it  was averred  numerous dispatches  of the most vital moment  were lying  unopened upon his table  where they were scattered  wet and stained with  wine and debauch  some of them having  as it was urged  been obviously  disfigured  in part  for the purpose  perhaps  of lighting cigars   while  pale  wretched and half insane  the miserable creature to whom  they were addressed  reclined on a sofa by their side  jabbering to  a few bloated boon companions  obscene jests and amusing anecdotes   through which the fire of his own native wit sometimes shot brilliantly   though but for a single moment  this  we say  greaves gathered from the  conversation around him  and as in one or two cases he perceived  on the  part of the speakers  scarcely any desire to preserve a tone of secrecy  on the subject  he felt pretty much assured  that the case was a bad  one indeed  and that the individual who could so far forget his own  interests for the sake of the bottle  and who could be tolerated in any  position of high trust in the state  while addicted to vices of such  a character  not to mention others  thought by the hamilton  quarterly  review  to be of a graver nature were that possible  must be sustained  by the influence of persons terribly deluded  or creatures vile in their  degree in turn  and who  like himself  were regardless of the trust  reposed in them by the people  and yet  as greaves afterwards learned   this same man came to canada a poor  bare footed  scotch lad  with a  father whose only fortune was an old fiddle  and that inexorable but  praiseworthy characteristic of his country  a determination to collect  the bawbees at whatever shrine first presented itself on the shores of  the new world  be this as it may  the daily press of the province has  since verified the correctness of the whispers heard by greaves   and made public the accusation  that this individual  so recently  distinguished by a mark of royal favor  for three weeks previous to the  invasion of canada  was so lost in a whirlpool of the most deplorable  intemperance  as to be utterly incapable of opening or attending to the  important dispatches which lay scattered and unheeded upon his bedroom  table     when greaves returned to the harp  he found o brien in a state of great  excitement  a soldier  as it appeared  had just arrived from the fort   with the information that the colonel  on second consideration  did not  find it justifiable to apply for barry s discharge  at a moment when  the country was threatened with danger  and that  as the regiment  should soon be ordered home  as he was assured  he had determined not to  recommend any discharges until it had reached england  this intelligence  had been conveyed to nicholas by the colonel in person  after parade   and in a manner which precluded the slightest hope of its being reversed  by any succeeding alteration of opinion on the part of the individual  who communicated it  a thunderbolt  had it fallen at the feet of the  young soldier  could not have startled or paralyzed him more  he was  actually struck dumb by it here was the chalice dashed from his lips  at last  he turned away in despair  but as he was for duty  he was  constrained to smother the tumultuous feelings within his breast  when  alone  however  and pacing his lonely round with his musket on his  shoulder  he had time to measure  with sufficient calmness and accuracy   the length  breadth and depth of the great misfortunes that had befallen  him  there was but one course left open to him  he had sought to  purchase his discharge and leave the service  without the taint of  desertion attaching to his name amongst any of his comrades  although he  felt that he was not morally bound to remain in the service of england   for a single moment longer than it served his own private ends   desertion  then  was the only course left open to him  and he was  determined to follow it  upon the first fitting opportunity  another  reason why he would rather have been discharged in the ordinary manner  from the service  if he once deserted he should never again  with any  degree of security  visit any portion of the british dominions  and  as canada lay so close beside the united states  he would gladly have  avoided the inconvenience of being shut out from it  as o brien and more  than one of his friends resided there  however  there was now no help  for it  to england he should never return  and so he disposed of the  matter in his own bosom  when relieved of duty  then  and with his  purpose fixed firmly in his heart  he once again visited the harp   where he found tom and greaves lamenting over the intelligence of his  misfortune  and to whom  in a moment of anxiety and excitement  he  disclosed his determination to quit the service  and gain the shores  of the neighboring republic the first favorable moment that presented  itself  tom appeared somewhat agitated if not alarmed  at so serious  a disclosure  made with such apparent unconcern  and it was only when  barry remembered the hint of the morning  which o brien gave him as he  was about proceeding to the garrison  that he  himself  felt that he had  perhaps been too incautious and precipitate before a person who  after  all  was but a stranger to him  although apparently a kindly one  the  cat being out of the bag  however  there was now no help for it  and  as greaves seemed to enter warmly into the project  and even offered to  share his purse with nicholas  if there was any necessity for it  the  matter was allowed to rest as it was  and suspicion of greaves  if any  remained in the breast of either the soldier or tom  was driven into the  background  and constrained to remain in abeyance for the time being     when barry again returned to his quarters  he freely discussed his  disappointment among his comrades  and declared his determination to  lay the matter before the commander in chief  averring  with great  earnestness  that he had always done his duty  and that he was not  accountable for the state of the country  and should not be called upon  to suffer for a condition of things outside and beyond his control  and  which he was in no manner instrumental in bringing about  his argument  seemed plausible enough  but then what  at any time  his argument  when  it ran counter to the desires or intentions of his commanding officer   therefore  the matter  after having been subjected to due discussion   was allowed to fall asleep in the usual stereotyped style  although as  may be supposed  there were one or two breasts  at least  that were kept  alive and active by it  nicholas  believing that any intelligence of his  embarrassment on the subject would but perplex and pain kate  determined  not to write to her regarding it  but to be the first to bear her the  news himself  as already observed  she had written to him to procure  his discharge at the earliest possible moment  and now to learn that  his freedom was jeopardized for an indefinite period  involving  in  addition  his return to england first  would be a renewal of her old  agony  this he was determined to spare her  so  to those of his company  in whom he could confide  and who were themselves ripe for any project  that would tend to their total disseverment from the flag they so  detested  he cautiously communicated his intentions  finding  in return   that more than one of them were on the eve of trying their fortune in  the same manner  soon  then  a sturdy little band had determined to  leave the fort  whatever night barry should pitch upon  premising  of  course  that it should be some one on which he would be on duty  and at  a favorable point     this much arranged  greaves and tom were made acquainted with the whole  particulars of the plot  the former entering  to all appearance  heart  and soul into it  and furthering it in every manner within the limits  of his power  in fact  greaves was actually behaving in a manner which  staggered some suspicions still entertained by tom  notwithstanding the  letter to which reference has already been made  for he agreed to assist  in forwarding the escape of one of nicholas  company that had deserted  sometime previously  and was still concealed in the outskirts of the  town  in a place known to barry only  and where he was hemmed in by  detectives from his regiment that were continually traversing the city  in colored clothes  or stationed as look outs at certain points in its  vicinity  barry was most anxious that this poor fellow should not be  left behind  and as greaves promised to procure a disguise for him and  have him conveyed secretly to tom s on the night that the project of  leaving the fort was to be put into execution  barry  at the request of  greaves  penned a note  which he hastily sealed with a love device well  known to the deserter  and which he had himself received at the hands of  the beautiful girl of his heart  the note ran thus          place the fullest confidence in the bearer  follow his directions    implicitly  your fate hangs in the balance  he will lead you to    where we shall meet  in great haste   c         nicholas barry      this note he handed to greaves  who immediately consigned it to his  pocket book  and set forth  as he alleged  to reconoitre the hiding  place of the soldier  and make such arrangements in his behalf as the  necessities of the case required     as the brief missive just quoted was written in o brien s  and in the  presence of tom himself  when greaves left the premises  the host with  some uneasiness observed        i don t know how it is  nick  but somehow or other i cannot divest  myself of sartain lurkin suspicions which i have of that man  although  there is not a single irish nationalist in the city that would not offer  him his hand and a glass afther seein the letther that i saw  however   you will remimber that the first night he came i didn t warm to him   as i tould you  notwithstandin that i had to give up the next mornin   still  and withal he appears to be actin fair  although i can t make out  exactly what he s about here  any way  in for a pinny in for a pound   so we must make the best of it  but  if i find that he is playin  foul  well  god almighty help him  and that s all i ll say  however   three nights from this will tell the whole story  and if you all make  good your escape  you may take my word for it  i ll make a clane breast  of it to him and ask his pardon into the bargain  i think with you that  it was wise not to write to kate about your throuble and disappointment   or apprise her of your intintion  as it would only agonize the poor  craytshure  but should you be foiled and taken  what a dreadful thing  it would be for her to hear instead of the intelligence of your freedom   that you were in the depths of a dungeon from which you might have no  manes of escape for years      barry absolutely shuddered at the possibility of such a  denouement  to  the scheme that now absorbed his whole mind and soul  although sensible  of the risk he ran  he never paused to regard the peculiar features of  the case as presented by his friend  but now that they loomed up before  him in such bold and fearful relief  he almost shrank from pushing  farther the dangerous project he had undertaken  yet  there was no other  channel through which he could hope to become speedily the husband of  the woman he loved  while  if he abandoned it  he might probably be  separated from her forever  as he felt convinced  that should an ocean  roll once more between them  she would not long survive the calamity  in  a moment  then  the faintness of his heart had passed away  and in  its stead came the firm resolve to prosecute his design to the death   feeling that imprisonment for any term of years on the shores trodden  by the being he adored  was preferable to freedom  such as it was  in a  land cut off from her by the trackless desert of the great deep     re assured once more  then  he continued cautiously the preparations  for his departure  attending to his duties with his usual assiduity  and  still murmuring at the decision of the colonel  neither he nor tom   of course  ever approached the hiding place of the refugee already  mentioned  although they managed to hear from him occasionally  and  to keep his spirits up  had either  by day or night  ventured near  his retreat  they could scarcely have escaped notice  the one from his  soldier s uniform and the other from his remarkable height and personal  appearance  they were  therefore  with all their misgivings  relieved of  their embarrassment in this relation  by the generous offer of greaves   who  as it seemed  had abundance of means at his command to further any  project that he might think proper to undertake relative to the escape  of the deserter  or those who had now determined to join him     in this way  then  matters stood on the very evening which was to close  in the night selected by the intending fugitives  to put their designs  into execution  everything was ready  and as the clock struck twelve and  the streets of the city were partially deserted  a cab rumbled up to  the door of the harp  and greaves and a stranger  muffled to the eyes   stepping from it  entered the establishment and passed through the bar  into tom s little parlor  greaves had kept his faith  the stranger was  the deserter           chapter ix       as might be presumed  from what we have already said regarding kate  mccarthy  from the moment she took up her abode with her relatives at  buffalo  she resumed her industrious habits  and set to work  in real  earnest  to add something to whatever young barry had realized from his  own abilities and steady conduct on both sides of the atlantic  for   since his arrival in canada  he had plied his pen amongst his comrades   and in other quarters  copying papers and instructing the children of  the soldiers where he was stationed  she consequently soon found her  little store increased  and her time fully occupied  in music and the  earlier branches of english  she had several young pupils  while  for some of the fancy millinery stores of the city  she occasionally  employed her needle on some of those delicate and exquisite ornaments of  female dress which are at once so expensive and attractive  her labors  were  of course  cheered through constant intercourse by letter with  barry  and so the time rolled on up to the very point when nicholas  first applied for his discharge  it may be considered strange  that  barry had not left the service on his first arrival in canada  but   then  let it be understood  that neither he nor kate had yet acquired  sufficient means with which to begin the world  while both were steadily  accumulating a little  slowly but safely  and when  besides  he felt  assured  that having the means at his command  he could  at any moment   procure his discharge  we have already said  that owing to his proud  and unyielding nature  he was not a favorite with his officers  and that  such being the case  he never  rose above the ranks  but  then  after  all  the most of his superiors had  at times  recourse to his pen and  excellent education in various matters connected with the regiment   requiting him for his services handsomely enough  but still at enmity  with his irish blood  and what they feared was  his anti british  tendencies  such inducements as these  although accompanied with  drawbacks  moved him to remain in the service for a longer period than  he should have done under other circumstances  and reconciled his lover  to an absence which she believed could be terminated at any moment  and  so time sped with her  until the eve of the very day  on the night of  which barry and his comrades were to leave the fort  when returning  towards her home in the direction of black bock  from the city  just  as it began to get dusk  she was met by an over dressed stranger  who  accosting her in a most respectful manner  begged to know if she could  direct him to the residence of miss kate mccarthy     after recovering her surprise  and casting a searching glance at her  interrogator  she replied  that she was  herself  miss mccarthy  and  begged to know what was his business with her  the man appeared to  hesitate  as if not crediting her assertion  and proceeded to say  that  he had a message for miss mccarthy  but that he was led to believe that  that lady was a much older person than the one whom he now addressed      possibly   returned kate   there is some other lady of my name here   but if such be the case  i am totally unaware of it  however   she  continued   as i expect no message from any person of my acquaintance   doubtless i am not the person you seek   and bowing slightly to the  stranger  she turned to pursue her way in the direction of her home      i beg your pardon for attempting to delay you   rejoined the stranger    but after all  you may be the lady i seek  if you are   he went on to  say   you will be apt to recognize this token   holding something in his  hand  which he now thrust out towards her     in an instant  her whole manner altered  her cheeks flushed  and a  strange light burned in her eyes  as she exclaimed hurriedly  and while  greatly agitated      yes  i am the person  let us walk towards the house  it is but a short  distance from where we stand      in a few moments  they were both engaged in the most earnest  conversation  and evidently entering into some stipulation that was to  be carried out without delay  on nearing her residence  however  the  stranger expressed his opinion  that it were better that he should  return to the city at once  and make some arrangements in connection  with the subject of their conversation  whatever that was  enforcing  upon her  in the meantime  the most profound secrecy  and the strange  necessity  above all things  of not informing any of her friends or  relations of the project upon which they had decided      twelve o clock  at the lower ferry  then   observed the stranger  as he  turned his face towards the city      twelve o clock   she returned   no fear  i shall be awaiting you      when she entered the house  with a view to concealing her emotions and  making some secret preparations for the accomplishment of the sudden  project foreshadowed by the words of the stranger  she hastily gained  her chamber  when alone  she gazed confused yet enraptured on the  unexpected talisman that had been given her  and which she still held  firmly in her grasp  soon  however  becoming more calm  she set about  making such arrangements for her midnight tryst as she conceived  necessary  upon the completion of which  she penned a few lines to her  kind relatives  begging them to make no inquiries after her  as she was  safe  although  for reasons afterwards to be explained  she was obliged  to leave their roof by stealth  and for the moment in utter darkness as  to her destination  she assured them  nevertheless  that although her  conduct was for the present suspicious and inexplicable  she was free  from any taint of wrong  and was only obeying a voice that would soon  justify to the fullest  and before them personally  the step she was  now about to take  this note was left upon her bed room table  where she  knew it would be discovered  so  after declining to join the family at  tea  on the plea of slight indisposition  she filled a traveling satchel  with what necessaries she thought she might require for the few days she  presumed she should be absent  and extinguishing her lamp at the hour  she usually retired to rest  awaited  alone and in silence  for the  clock to strike eleven  at which time she knew the family would have all  sought their couch and be sunk in slumber     from her chamber window she perceived that the lights soon began to  disappear from the casements of the few dwellings that were in the  immediate vicinity of her habitation  and that the quiet of repose  was stealing over the neighborhood  busied with her own thoughts   and anxious for the future  the time for her departure drew nigh more  rapidly than she had anticipated  so  when the last stroke of eleven had  died away through the house  she  having previously attired herself  for her journey  and secured  about her person  whatever money she  possessed  took up her satchel  and cautiously descending the stairs   soon emerged out into the gloomy night  hastily bending her footsteps  towards the place of rendezvouz     here  besides encountering the individual already introduced to the  reader  who was waiting for her  she having had to travel a considerable  distance  and it being now close on midnight  she found a second party  stationed by the side of a good sized boat  into which all three stepped  upon her arrival  the two strangers seizing the oars and striking boldly  out for the canadian side of the river  although rapid the current at  the point of their crossing  so admirably did they manage their craft  and lustily did they pull  they did not deviate much from the light on  the opposite shore  which seemed to gleam from some cottage window  and  which they took as a beacon and guide to their course  in the space  of about half an hour  they landed at the point they expected to make   where they found a team waiting  with a lantern so ingeniously fixed in  the wagon as to be discernible from the american side of the river only   this being the light by which the two boatmen had steered     as they all stepped ashore  kate had a full opportunity of scrutinizing  the appearance of the second stranger  who aided her in crossing the  river  he was a short  thick set  heavy man  of a most forbidding  aspect  with a huge mouth and a broad  flat nose  without a bridge  he  wore a blue flannel shirt and a heavy  short over coat and slouched hat   and was  taking him all and all  about as villainous a looking specimen  of humanity as one could well meet in a day s walk  nor was the driver  of the wagon into which she now was lifted  a very decided improvement  in this relation  he  also  was a most suspicions looking fellow   although civil enough in his way  kate felt relieved  however  when her  earliest acquaintance of the evening took his seat beside her  and  when she perceived the man with the blue shirt re entering the boat and  pushing off for the american shore once again     the driver now having adjusted himself in his place in front of kate  and her polite companion  the whip was laid to the horses  and the party  moved briskly along the bank of the river  until they struck into a road  which evidently led into the interior of the country  this road they  pursued at a slow pace until the first gray streaks of dawn were visible  in the eastern horizon  kate s companion  from time to time  making  such commonplace observations as the necessity of the case required  she  supposing that the presence of the driver prevented him from offering  her any farther explanation on the subject of her singular adventure   just as surrounding objects were becoming more distinct  they pulled up  before an isolated building  in what appeared to be a country place  and  in which  early as it was  there was some person already astir  as was  evident from the light which shone from one of the windows     here they all alighted and were received at the door of the dwelling by  a middle aged woman  with a strip of red silk bound round her head and  drawn down over one of her eyes  she was dressed in a plain but neat  manner  and exhibited sufficient traits of feminine beauty to recommend  her to either sex  the driver was evidently her husband  and no very  affectionate one either  if the coarse  cold manner in which he received  her welcome could be taken as any indication on this head  however  as  kate was cold and weary  she gladly accepted an invitation to alight and  enter the building  where she found a large fire blazing and crackling  upon the hearth  in an apartment that was used as a dining room and  kitchen  although the house was a large one and clearly contained many  apartments  when seated by the fire  and while the driver was seeing to  his horses  her companion  who also seated himself by the warm  blaze  informed her that  for the present  she was at the end of her  journey  that the driver  his wife and a grown up niece or daughter   were the only inhabitants of the house  and that the place was selected  as her retreat for the time being  for reasons that would doubtless be  explained to her in due time  although surprised and mystified at all  she had already experienced  she  of course  had not one word to say in  opposition to the disposition that had been made of her  for had she  not in her bosom the guarantee that all was right  so  professing her  willingness to remain in her temporary abode until the period for her  release arrived  and promising to be as patient as possible  under the  circumstances  she begged the woman of the house to show her to her  room  as she needed a few hours rest  to which request her hostess  readily acceded  having first  though in vain  endeavored to prevail  upon her to take some refreshments after her journey     the room to which kate was shown was far from a despicable one  and  possessed many articles of furniture infinitely superior to those in the  department she had first entered  the floor was carpeted  and the chairs  and tables of quite a superior quality  the bed  also  seemed invitingly  clean and comfortable  while some excellent books were to be found in a  small  neat case  standing in one corner of the apartment  on the table  there burned a handsome lamp  and a fire blazed cheerfully in a small   open stove  as though her arrival had been expected and well cared for   when her hostess left her  she examined her chamber door and windows   and found the latter quite secure  while in the lock of the former was  a key  one turn of which would cut her off completely from any intrusion  whatever  seating herself beside her lamp  she reviewed rapidly the  events of the night  and finding no solution for them  she slowly  undressed  and consigning herself to the care of heaven  was soon lost  in a calm and refreshing slumber  from which she did not awake until the  sun had nearly attained his meridian glory     when she opened her eyes and collected her scattered senses  she hastily  arose  and dressing herself  rang a small bell that lay on her table   and which her hostess desired she should use when she required any  attendance  immediately a gentle tap was heard at her chamber door   upon opening which  a young girl  about sixteen years of age  presented  herself with a pitcher of fresh water  begging to know  as she placed it  on the wash stand  at what period she should bring up breakfast  setting  about opening the windows as she spoke  and otherwise busying herself in  arranging the room  there was something in the appearance of this young  creature  that at once enlisted the sympathy and kindly feelings of  kate  her features were strangely handsome and prepossessing  and her  form of the very finest proportions  her hands  although rough with hard  work  were  nevertheless  small and delicately shaped  while her feet   notwithstanding that they were encased in a pair of over large slippers   were obviously very beautiful  she was tall for her age  and apparently  better educated than her seeming condition in life might warrant  but  what was most peculiar about her  was an air of sadness  that seemed  native to her expressive countenance  and which pervaded her smiles  even  with a strange  subduing power  that nearly allied them to gentle  tears  her voice  too  was singularly sweet  low and melodious  while  her whole demeanor was so tinged with what might be termed some lone   hidden sorrow  that kate felt drawn towards her in a manner the most  unaccountable  in answer to a query put to her  she said she was not  as  was generally supposed  the daughter of the owners of the establishment   but their niece  as she believed  and that she had now been residing  in the locality for over five years  that her uncle did a great deal of  teaming  and was often from home  and that  in his absence  she and her  aunt took care of a small patch of ground that lay at the back of the  house  she was almost glad  she said  that the lady had come to stay  sometime with them  and hoped that she would allow her to often sit by  her and read during the times her uncle would be away  as it might tend  to beguile many a weary hour  that is  provided the lady would have to  remain any length of time with them     there was something in all this which seemed to move kate strangely  the  expression  almost glad  sounded curiously in her ears  and awakened  in her feelings of a no very pleasurable character  however  she  determined  upon so slight an acquaintance  not to push her inquiries  further just then  and by way of forming a friendly compact with her  attendant  assured her  that so long as she remained in the house  she  should always be happy to have her as a companion whenever she could be  spared from her domestic duties  and further  that it would afford her  the greatest possible pleasure to sit and listen to her  whenever she  could find a moment s time to either read for her or while away a few  minutes in friendly conversation  this condescension seemed to light up  the face of the interesting young creature with a flush of gratitude  the most ardent  and with a lighter step than that with which she had  entered the chamber  she tripped away  for the purpose of bringing up  the breakfast to which she had already referred     when martha  as kate s new acquaintance was called  again entered the  apartment  she was accompanied by her aunt  who was dressed just as she  had been the night before  with the exception that the strip of red  silk had been replaced by a purple band of the same material  as the  breakfast  which was excellent for a country place  was being placed  upon the table  kate perceived that one side of the woman s face was  discolored  and being moved to make some inquiries regarding the cause   was informed  that while breaking up some kindling wood  a splinter  had accidentally struck her face  this went to satisfy her  of course   although she thought the large  black patch which fell down along the  cheek was singularly dark and wide to be traceable to the small splinter  that the woman asserted to be the cause of it  a strange look from  martha  too  aroused a suspicion that the origin of the disfigurement  was not that named  so here the matter rested for the present     during her repast  she learned from martha  who remained with her  that  the name of the people of the house was wilson  that they were english   and that the person who had arrived in company with her uncle  who was  also english  was called stephen smith  but where he resided she was  unable to say  this she knew  however  that he made occasional visits to  the family  and was sometimes accompanied by a very ill looking man  who  remained a day or two  after having left some boxes or cases in charge  of her uncle  who subsequently disposed of them in some manner unknown  to her      but   she continued   i don t like these men  they always come in the  night  and go away in the night  and are ever whispering  you must not   however   she went on to say   mention this to either my aunt or my  uncle  for  if they should know i had said so much  they would doubtless  be very angry with me       oh   returned kate   you may rely upon it  that whatever you may choose  to say in relation to the men in question  or anything else  shall  remain in my bosom  for to betray any confidence of the kind  would  in  my eyes  be criminal in the last degree       what brought you here  then   what brought you here   ejaculated  martha  in an anxious  nervous tone   there must be something  wrong   some treachery  or i am sure a lady so good and pure as you seem  to be  would never cross this threshold      kate  becoming instantly alarmed  broke off suddenly in her repast  and  begged the young girl  for heaven s sake  to be more explicit      i really don t know what more to say than i have already said   replied  the girl   but  as i feel drawn towards you by some invisible power   short as our acquaintance has been  i will say  that i fear my uncle s  associates are lawless men  and believe that my aunt knows it  and  regrets it  too  but a few nights ago  when smith came here to make  arrangements about your arrival  as i suppose  i heard high words  between my relatives after his departure  and  the next morning  found  my aunt s face just as you have seen it  but we dare not say much in  opposition to any proposition that my uncle might choose to make in any  connection  so violent and brutal is his temper at times  for my own  part  however   she proceeded   so soon as i can escape from such  thraldom and associations  i shall try and make my own way in the world   for my impression is  my uncle has some idea of a union between me and  the detestable creature  smith  who accompanied you here last night  and  who  after an hour s rest  was again driven off by my uncle  doubtless  to whatever point he came from      this intelligence  as may be supposed  caused poor kate the greatest  possible anxiety  but what had she to fear so long as she took the  talisman for her guide  here there could be no mistake  anyway  for had  she not it in her bosom  and was it not from  him   still  that there  was something perfectly mysterious about the whole affair  she was quite  ready to admit  but as she had received the strictest injunctions from  smith not to permit herself to be seen for the present in the vicinity  of the place  or outside the dwelling  she determined to obey one to  whom no small power in her case had unquestionably been delegated by her  lover     during the day martha and kate were frequently together  the poor young  girl disclosing her history scrap by scrap  until at last kate learned  that she was in reality an orphan  that both her parents died when she  was yet quite young  that her aunt  who was possessed of an excellent  education  had been twice married  once to her own mother s brother  and  subsequently to the man whom she now called uncle  that her own parents  had been irish  and that on their death  her real uncle became her  guardian and true friend until his death  when  on this second   unfortunate marriage  the affairs of the family becoming hopelessly  embarrassed  she and her relatives embarked for america  taking up their  abode first in toronto  and subsequently in the place where they now  resided  in addition  she stated that her opportunities of education  had been good  and that  somehow or other  since she had crossed the  atlantic  she managed to keep a few choice books about her  and avail  herself of the assistance of her aunt  whenever they could  in the  absence of her uncle  devote an hour to study or the perusal of some new  work     the small clearing  on the verge of which the house occupied by the  wilsons stood  was surrounded with woods  and no other habitation was  to be found in its immediate vicinity  from the morose disposition and  suspicious character of the proprietor himself  but few of the neighbors  were on visiting terms with the family  so that they might be said  to lead a completely sequestered life  from time to time only  an  occasional visit was paid him by some one who stood in need of the  services of his team  and thus his standing in the neighborhood was that  of a suspected or banned man  the general impression being  that he  was neither more nor less than a dangerous and daring smuggler  who was  constantly engaged in the interests of unprincipled merchants on both  sides of the lines  this idea obtained footing from the circumstance  that he had been observed returning late one night from the frontier  with his wagon laden down with suspicious looking boxes and bales   and from the further fact  that his absences from home were frequently  lengthy and mysterious  no one knowing the precise nature of his  business  or the points to which his journeys were made so often     the clearing  itself  was under good cultivation  the spring crops  giving fine promise of an abundant harvest  a short distance from the  house flowed a beautiful brook  whose murmurs occasionally reached the  ears of the inmates  while the thickening foliage of the surrounding  groves  as they might be termed  gave shelter to various birds  amongst  which might now be heard  at early morn and throughout the day  the  clear  round notes of the robin      the robin    what on earth has  we should like to know  bewitched  ornithologists to designate the great  coarse  tuneless bird  that  visits us in the earliest dawn of spring  in this far off america   the  robin   neither in throat nor plumage is it even a thirty first cousin  of the sweet  timid  little  brown bunch of melody that haunts the  hawthorn hedges of ireland and the sister island  when they are in  bloom  or seeks a crumb at the open casement  when winter ruffles all  its russet plumes  and sets his chill  white seal on all its stores  we  have been often struck with the great dissimilarity between these two  namesakes of the feathered kingdom  for never on these transatlantic  shores have we heard what might be termed a domestic bird sing a song  so sweet as that poured beneath our window in the soft blue haze of an  irish summer evening  by the genuine robin red breast  as he sang the  daylight down the west  through a sky flushed and flecked with azure   crimson and gold  to such extreme intensity  that the poet or painter  might  at the moment  half indulge in the idea  that the sun had fallen  into curious ruins upon the verge of the horizon  oh  the silver thread  of such a song  as it flashed and scintillated from that trembling  throat  never shall we forget it  or the land in which it first wound  itself around our heart     but this  we know  is inclined to be sentimental  and as we now have  to do with stern realities  we shall resume the chain of our story  by saying  that after her first day s residence with the wilsons  and  finding that the uncle of martha had no intelligence for her on his  return home on the evening or night succeeding the one of her arrival   she expressed her great anxiety to martha  who now devoted every moment  she could spare from her other duties  to the pleasing task of rendering  her solitude as agreeable as possible     on the morning of the second day after her arrival she ventured to  ask wilson if he had any idea of when she was to be relieved from her  embarrassing position  in reply to her interrogatory he assured her   that he was quite unable to give her any information on the subject  but  was led to believe that she should not be long a prisoner  as he termed  it  all he could say in relation to the matter was  that some person   with whose name even he was unacquainted  had secured  through a third  party  his services as her host  and engaged the apartment she occupied   and attendance  etc  in addition to this  he observed  carelessly  that  he was responsible for her safety until the arrival of those who  had delegated to him the right to watch over her and shield her from  observation until the proper moment arrived     to all this kate made no reply  the thought having just struck her  that  nicholas had perhaps learned of some intended design upon her by lauder   and that he took this method of transporting her to some point  unknown to that person  until he himself could offer her his full and  unembarrassed protection  yet she wondered why it was that he had left  her in such dreadful uncertainty  and did not write her explicitly  upon the subject again  she was perplexed at the idea that he was in no  position to learn anything of the plots or plans of her rejected suitor   if he entertained any  so that  upon the whole  she was in no very  comfortable state of mind when she rejoined martha whom she had left in  her chamber  and whom she now induced to make up a bed upon a sofa and  consent to sleep in her apartment during her stay     martha  on her part  moved by this token of friendship  and while  sitting up late on the very night of the conversation with wilson   became mysteriously nervous and  through various vague hints and  insinuations  so far alarmed kate at last  that the poor girl implored  her new acquaintance to tell her frankly if she knew anything that bore  upon her ease  or the reasons for her being so singularly circumstanced     to this solicitation martha made no direct reply  but rising cautiously   she stepped lightly towards the chamber door  and opening it softly  put out her head into the passage and listened for a few moments  then  gently closing the door  she again noiselessly retraced her steps   and drawing her seat close beside that of kate  began thus  in a low   trembling voice  in which fear and agitation were distinctly traceable      oh  miss mccarthy  horrible as the disclosure is  i believe that   instead of a smuggler  which my aunt and i long supposed him to be  my  uncle is a robber  or leagued with robbers  this  for the first time   came to our knowledge last night  after his return from wherever he had  been  we had been always accustomed to his bringing here  during the  night  mysterious packages  but as he informed us that they were goods  for merchants who  as he asserted  resided at some distance  we took him  at his word  and when he removed the goods again were  of course  under  the firm impression that he carried them to their owners  however  as  i have observed  on returning last night  when my aunt and i were  assisting him to remove a heavy case from his wagon  while carrying it  into the stable to place it under the hay beneath which he invariably  concealed such things  my aunt and i perceived that  this time  it was  a large trunk that he had brought  and that the lock had given way   disclosing gleams within it  as though it contained some bright objects   he did not notice the circumstance of the fastening having failed  and  we did not call his attention to the fact  but permitted him to shake  the hay over it as usual  subsequently  however  my aunt and i referred  to the matter  when she  taking advantage of my uncle s sound slumbers   he having retired to rest before her  went out again and  re lighting  the stable lantern  removed the covering from the lid of the great  trunk  and raising it  perceived that it contained many valuable  articles of silver and dress  but all evidently old  and huddled  together in a manner the most confused  this almost paralysed the poor  woman  and as i subsequently inspected the package  on her retiring for  the night  i arrived at the conclusion which she had  as she informed  me  herself previously adopted  namely  that the goods were stolen  and  that smith was in some way mixed up with the robbery      now  indeed  kate felt her situation alarming in the truest sense of  the term  and sat looking at her companion in speechless horror and  amazement  mystery upon mystery it was  but as the dangers that appeared  to surround her  though gloomy  were indistinct  she once more had  recourse to her panacea of the token  and seeking her couch with a  fervent prayer on her lip  was soon  like her young friend on the sofa   lost in uneasy slumbers           chapter x       it was on the night of sunday the   th of may        that barry and his  comrades were to attempt their escape from the fort  and  as already  seen  it was on the same night that the deserter was conveyed in a cab  to the harp  by greaves  two o clock in the morning was the time decided  upon  and a rendezvous having been appointed  our hero  who was on  guard  saw  without challenging them  six figures steal by him into  the darkness and immediately disappear  no sooner had the last of them  vanished  than he placed his musket bolt upright in his sentry box   and the next moment was lost also in the gloom  and in the direction in  which the figures had melted from his vision  soon he reached the side  of the river  where he found tom with a boat  beside which stood his  six companions  on recognizing him  they all leaped into the boat  and   although the moon was in the heavens  sheltered by the dark overhanging  clouds that fortunately filled the sky  they dropped down the river  and  landing tom at a point previously decided upon  they all wrung his hand  in silence  and once more put forth into the gloom  heading their craft  towards the american shore  under the guidance of a pilot who knew every  island and turn in the channel  and who joined them at the spot where  o brien bid them farewell  with muffled oars and in the most profound  silence  they moved along until they arrived at a turn in the channel   where they were instructed to bend to their work by the stranger who  held the tiller  when  taking heart from their good fortune  for so far   they made their willing craft almost leap out of the water  as they gave  a long pull  a strong pull  and a pull altogether     as day was beginning to shape the world around them  they found  themselves nearing the american shore  and now perceiving themselves  beyond the reach of danger and out of the jurisdiction of the flag they  had so long and so cordially detested  they rested on their oars  and  giving three hearty cheers for the land they were fast approaching   again set to with a will  and soon found themselves beneath the stars  and stripes of the glorious republic before which all the nations of the  earth now bow  however reluctantly  on leaping ashore  they discovered  a short distance from the water a small village to which  on securing  their boat  they all posted  and having gained a neat little tavern  the  shutters of which were just being opened  they explained their situation  to the proprietor  and ordered breakfast  determined to rest themselves  for a period  and deliberate upon their future movements  although the  destination of barry had  of course  long been decided upon     on hearing that they were deserters from the british army  and that   without an exception  they were all irishmen  who had come to the united  states with a view to aiding in any project that had for its object the  humiliation of england  and the freedom of ireland  the landlord  who  was a six footer from tipperary  one of the cummingses  gave  a yell  out of him  that brought his wife and children in  deshabille  to the  bar room door  proceeded by a boy of all work  who evidently shared  their alarm and surprise to the fullest extent  but when  instead of a  bar room disturbance  they perceived the master of the premises shaking  hands over and over again with the new arrivals  and bidding them  welcome to the land of the free  they soon disappeared from the hall  and regained their chambers  from which they had been so unceremoniously  summoned  cummings was literally in his glory  and instantly had his  counter be littered with glasses  bottles and decanters  while  with  genuine hospitality  he made the fugitives partake more than once of  some one of the beverages that he had placed before them  ere long  a smoking  hot breakfast was in readiness for them  prepared by the  mistress of the house   herself a comely irishwoman  with a set of teeth  that you d almost let bite you  they were so white and sunny  and a  handsome  fair face  with a  cead mille failte  in every line and dimple  of it  already the poor adventurers began to feel the exhilarating  effects of freedom  and  as soon as they had satisfied their appetites   each set about changing his soldier s coat for a rough  plain one   which had been provided by o brien and his friends  and which they found  awaiting them when they first entered the boat     as barry  who was regarded as chief of the little party  avowed his  intention of pushing on direct for buffalo  the others  who had no fixed  point in view  determined to join him  so  when they had taken a few  hours repose  they parted from their kind host and hostess  who would  not permit them to pay a single shilling for anything they had drank or  eaten since they entered the friendly hostel  during the time they were  waiting at the railway station  they heard various rumors as to the  intended invasion of the province they had but just left  and from  numerous significant hints which they had received  they were fully  convinced that some important movement was on foot  which would soon  develope itself in bolder outline  on entering the cars that were to  take them west  they found the subject of fenianism freely discussed   and in many cases with a friendliness that showed there was  in some  instances at least  a feeling hostile to england among the american  people  as they pursued their journey and received other accessions  to their numbers as travellers  they found that this aversion was both  widely spread and deeply rooted  so that by the time they reached their  destination  they were fully satisfied that the people of america  and  those of the adjoining english colony  could never become true friends  so long as the latter adheared to the standard of great britain  or  remained part and parcel of the british empire  the antagonism of  institutions  the infamous conduct of england during the late civil war   and the fixed impression of every true american  that the canadas  belong of right to the great people who now rule the continent  made it  strikingly apparant that england had but a precarious foot hold upon the  shores of the new world     on the arrival of the train at black rock  barry  who had been  previously informed as to the precise locality in which the relatives of  kate were to be found  stepped off the cars  informing his comrades  that he would join them in the city during the day  with but little  difficulty he found the dwelling of his friends  and entering it  was  received with open arms  and was instantly asked as to where he left  kate  for a moment he did not comprehend the question  but when by  degrees he heard the fearful disclosure  that she had secretly left the  house  by night  about a week previously  he fell into a chair  almost  fainting  while the greatest consternation seized all those about him   slowly  and with their hearts sinking within them  they recounted the  circumstance of the note that had been written and left for them on  her bedroom table  and the fact of her having taken some of her wearing  apparel with her  but as to where she had gone  or with whom  they  were in the most profound darkness  no one had called at the house   no  previous intimation had been given them by her as to her intentions   and  in so far as they were concerned  all was darkness  lauder  they  knew  had been in the vicinity of the rock  but then  of course  he  could have had no hand in the strange transaction  as her detestation  of him precluded  as they thought  the possibility of his exercising the  slightest influence over any of her actions  however  she was gone  and  now  as it appeared  was the victim of some horrible plot or mistake  beyond the reach of any elucidation  for the present at least     never was a strong man so bowed to the dust as the poor young fellow who  now found all his hopes so rudely and unexpectedly dashed to the earth   with a face pale as death he shook throughout every limb in a manner  fearful to behold  in vain he looked from one face to another for some  explanation of the dreadful calamity that had befallen him  all was  dark and blank and silent around him  even conjecture was paralysed  so  completely was the disappearance of his betrothed enveloped in mystery   as a preliminary step  to gain even the feeblest information of her   he did not know how  or when or where to move  could he get even  the slightest glimpse of any link in the chain  he could set about  unravelling the tangled and gloomy skein  but as it was  he was as  helpless as a child  secure in her fidelity  however  and trusting to  providence  crushed as he was  his young heart  after the first blow   began to rise within him  and collecting himself  he set about making  such enquiries in the neighborhood as he thought were likely to throw  some light upon the subject  in this he was warmly aided by the alarmed  wife of his friend  who learned that on the very evening of the night of  her disappearance  after having given her last music lesson in the  house of one of her pupils  she was seen in company with a man  who  was recognized as no very respectable character  by one of the hands  employed in the rolling mills  who happened to catch a glimpse of them  in conversation as he was returning from his work  the name of this  latter individual having been ascertained  barry at once visited the  mills and heard  to his consternation  that the suspicious person seen  in company with kate on the evening referred to  was neither more nor  less than the kid  previously introduced to the reader  as one of the  keepers of the low gambling house already mentioned  where we first met  him and his partner of the blue shirt  alluded to also as a burglar and  robber     this much ascertained  nicholas prevailed upon the workman to accompany  him to the den in question  into which they accidentally dropped as it  were  the person they sought was  as usual  about the premises  but from  him barry could gain no information whatever  beyond the circumstance   that he did remember  about a week ago  accosting a lady near black  bock  having taken the liberty of enquiring of her  whether a certain  person whom he was anxious to find resided in the neighborhood      i know that s a lie   said the workman  when he and nicholas had gained  the street once more   for as i happened to come upon them just as they  were separating  i heard the lady say  before she perceived me  and as i  was turning a corner of the road   i ll not fail to be there   or words  to that effect      to nicholas this was more perplexing than ever  although he now arrived  at the conclusion  that kate was the victim of some infamous and  deep laid plot  and that lauder was at the bottom of it  but here again  he was embarrassed by the circumstance  that he had never  so far as he  knew  seen her rejected suitor  nor was he known to any of his friends  at the rock  from the fact that they had left toronto before his arrival  there  and that  notwithstanding his visits to buffalo  he had never  crossed their path  all  then  that nicholas had to stand upon was the  circumstance that she had actually been seen in conversation with the  kid  and that that worthy had evidently misrepresented the tenor of that  conversation  whatever it might have been     the next day after his arrival  barry  with a heart sore and dark  enough  went in search of his comrades  informing such of them as he  thought proper to admit to his confidence  of the dreadful condition of  his affairs and mind  while sympathising with him sincerely  however   and offering him all the assistance in their power  they seemed absorbed  with some new subject of importance which appeared to engross no  ordinary share of their attention  since their arrival  they had learned  that it was a fact and beyond all doubt  that the fenians were gathering  along the frontier for the purpose of making a descent upon canada and  securing a foothold upon its shores  with a view to making it the  basis of operations against england in their attempt to secure the  independence of ireland  one and all they had determined to join the  expedition as volunteers  and nicholas  who entertained a lurking  suspicion that kate had crossed the american frontier under some  mysterious impulse or influence  half made up his mind to make one of  the invading army also  this suspicion was based upon the fact of kate s  having no friends or relatives in the states  save those at the rock   while she had several in canada in the direction of which she might  have been attracted by letters or representations now a mystery to him   however  he felt assured that  under any circumstance  she was not to be  found in buffalo or its vicinity  so  moved by both love and patriotism   before the evening had set in  he came to the conclusion to join his  comrades in the approaching struggle     this resolution once taken  he made instant application to some of the  fenian authorities of the city  stating the circumstance of his recent  arrival  and quickly found himself surrounded by a host of friends who  were ready to share their last mouthful or dollar with him  during this  juncture  the irish spirit of buffalo  strongly impregnated with the  generous national sentiment of america  was discernible upon every side   the groups of patriots quietly at first arriving from almost every  point of the compass  were received with open arms and the sincerest  hospitality by those who had an interest in the cause of freedom and the  humiliation of the tyrant england  there were  of course  a few british  sympathisers among the people and press who  ignoring their allegiance  to the union  or the principles for which the heroes of the revolution  laid down their lives  threw their voice and influence into the scale on  the side of england  but they were in a hopeless minority  as the great  heart of the nation beat steadily in the interests of liberty  and  inspired its sons with all the confidence necessary to the most complete  success     to decide  with barry  was to act  consequently  now that he had made  up his mind to join the expedition  he at once acquainted his friends  at the rock  and gave them such information and instructions relative to  kate as he thought desirable  intimating to them  at the same time  that  he was of the fixed impression that she had  by some means or other   been lured into canada  although a telegram  in reply to one dispatched  to toronto  informed his friends that she had not visited that city  since she left it  upon further inquiry  however  regarding the kid   he learned that that respectable personage  together with his worthy  coadjutor  black jack  were in the habit of paying frequent visits to  canada on the sly  it being thought that they were employed by persons  who were engaged in smuggling  this information he gained while  walking near the breakwater with a new acquaintance well versed in city  notorieties  and who  at the moment  happened to espy a boat known to  belong to the doubtful firm of jack and the kid  lying drawn up on the  shore     this craft  of course  engaged the attention of our hero  as belonging   in part  to the individual who seemed to be mixed up in some mysterious  manner with the fate of his beloved  consequently  he stepped over to it  and casting a glance of scrutiny at the interior  saw something sparkle  among a little sand  that had accumulated at the bottom near one of the  stretchers  picking it up  he found that it was a handsome button that  had apparently dropped from the dress of some lady  this he examined  with the most intense eagerness  when the thought struck him that it  was very like some buttons that belonged to a dress occasionally worn by  kate  of this  however  he was not sufficiently certain  so  thrusting  it into his pocket  he turned away  more perplexed than ever with the  mystery that surrounded him  hurrying to the rock with the waif as  soon as he could  he submitted it to his friends  when it was at once  recognized as being similar to a set of buttons worn by kate  and which  belonged to a dress that  it was believed  she wore on the night of her  disappearance  corroborative as this evidence was  it availed him but  little for the time being  although it strengthened his resolve to move  with the army of invasion  being convinced that his betrothed had  by  some foul means  been spirited across the borders  and all through the  machinations of her rejected suitor  lauder     and now how he cursed the procrastination that had kept him from  applying for his discharge long since  when he might have procured it  without any difficulty  and have placed her he loved beyond the power  of any villain  again  he was no longer free to search for her in the  province  for he was under the ban of military law there  and  unless  supported by a sufficient number of bayonets  could not stem the torrent  that should soon overwhelm him if he re entered the territories of the  queen and was discovered  yet  even death were preferable to the state  of mind in which he now found himself  he therefore at once set to work  to prepare himself for the coming contest  in the hope that when once  across the borders  if even amid the din of war  he might gain some clue  to the fate of all that he now cared to live for     as may be supposed  the service of such men as nicholas and his comrades  were  at a moment so critical  accepted with alacrity by the military  authorities of the fenian organization of the city  amongst the various  sterling patriots in power here  both he and his comrades were instantly  taken by the hand and placed in positions where their knowledge of arms  could be made most serviceable to the grand cause in which they had  resolved to embark  they were all irish  and of that stamp that never  loses color  how fierce soever the scorching fires to which they might  be subjected  under a special provision  and at barry s request   they were attached to the same company  while he  from his evident  superiority in education and address  as well as from his thorough  knowledge of drill and military tactics  was presented  upon joining  the organization  with a captain s commission  in the hurry and bustle  attending the note of preparation  he found some slight relief from  the great and overshadowing trouble that darkened all around him  and  finding how necessary it was to keep both mind and body employed  if he  was to retain either health or energy to aid him in any of the important  projects that now loomed before him  he gave no place to useless  repinings  but busily engaged with the necessities of his new avocation   found the hours slipping by which intervened between the period when  he swore the true fealty of his soul to the flag of his love  and  that which was to see him a hostile invader upon the shores he had so  recently left     as the men steadily poured into the city for a short period before the  invasion  and filled the streets and suburbs in groups of various sizes   it became a matter of general conversation and surprise that  in bodies  so peculiarly situated  and under such seemingly slight restraint  many  of them being far distant from their homes  not a single individual  was to be found who suffered in the slightest degree from even the  appearance of intoxication  look where you might  there was nothing but  the utmost sobriety and good behaviour  although the men were  for the  most part  young  and many of them just from the bloodiest fields of the  south  there hung about them an air of serious decorum that argued  well for the mission in which they were about to engage  in addition   notwithstanding that  in some cases  they were badly housed and  provisioned  a murmur never escaped their lips  nor could the most  bitter of their enemies point to a single act where the law was violated  by any of them  or show that even to the value of one mouthful of bread  had been appropriated to their use without being paid for honestly  or  given to them freely by those who felt for their position  this is so  well known that  even at the period at which we write  upwards of two  years after the occurrence of these scenes  not a solitary fact has come  to light reflecting in any degree upon the honesty  sobriety and good  conduct of these noble patriots  many of whom had left home penniless   to wage war against a power that had almost every resource at its  command  and which they knew they should meet under circumstances that  could not fail to be disadvantageous to them     and here we may observe  history does not record a more daring or  chivalrous project than that entertained by the brave fellows who made  the night of thursday the   st of may        memorable in the annals of  this continent  as well as in those of ireland  although laboring under  embarrassments from the most fearful mistakes and criminal neglect of an  individual to whom the grand project of the redemption of ireland  from the yoke of the oppressor was  in its strictly military aspect   entrusted in this country  although badly provisioned  uniformed  and equipped  although perplexed with mysterious  contradictory and  imperfect orders  and although  at the very moment of their destiny   left without the leader whom they were led to expect should command  them  they never lost heart for a moment  feeling that heaven would  raise up amongst them a chief not only competent to meet the emergency  of the moment  but one in whom they should be able to place the fullest  and most enthusiastic confidence     and heaven did not disappoint their noble and confiding aspirations   for  when all looked dark and dreary to the more uneasy of their  numbers  the gallant o neill  crowned with the laurels which he had  so nobly won during the war that had then just closed  and true to the  genius of his ancient name and house  stepped in upon the stage  and  grasping the drooping standard of the irish republic  held it aloft   and  fired with the spirit of the  red hand  of yore  raised the war cry  of his race  before which many a saxon tyrant and slave had trembled in  the days long past           chapter xi       when philip greaves received the note from barry  to the deserter who  was secreted in the suburbs of the city  he proceeded  towards evening   to the point where the soldier lay concealed  and to which he had been  directed with unerring accuracy  on reaching the house in which the  fugitive was said to be hidden  he found but an old woman  who seemed  neither alarmed nor surprised at his arrival  upon whispering a word  in her ear  however  a look of intelligence stole into her eyes  and  putting on her bonnet and cloak  in the deep dusk  she motioned him to  follow her  having closed and locked to door behind her  after leading  him but a short distance  among a number of small though clean huts   she gained one in which the family were seated at their plain evening  repast  as they entered the dwelling  he perceived that there was one  vacant seat at the table  from which some person had evidently arisen  hastily and disappeared from the apartment in the course of a few  moments  however  and on the head of the family having been called  aside by the old woman  philip was greeted with a hearty welcome  and  instantly led into a little back room  where he found the person whom  he sought  gazing about him with a distrustful if not an alarmed air   to this individual he showed barry s note  which he had previously  abstracted from the envelope  requesting him  as he perused it  to  return it to him again  as he wished to destroy it himself  lest  by  accident  it should fall into other hands  and as he desired to say to  nicholas that he was personally cognizant of the fact of its being put  out of the way  to this request the deserter readily acceded  as he  would have to any other of a reasonable character  so delighted was he  to receive the assurance that the hour of his deliverance drew nigh   here  then  were the particulars of the plan of his escape settled upon   he was to remain still concealed  until greaves called for him with  a cab  but was to hold himself ready to quit his hiding place at a  moment s notice     these preliminaries being arranged  philip left the house and speedily  proceeded to a neighboring hotel  where he procured a private room  and   calling for pen  ink and paper  at once addressed himself to writing  a letter  various were the rubbings of hands and sinister smiles which  punctuated this epistle  until at last  on its being finished  he  carefully folded it  and taking from his pocket book a sealed envelope   one end of which had been previously opened with great care  and the  superscription completely removed by a cunning process  he took from  another compartment of his book a small note and introduced it into the  envelope  adroitly closing the apperture with a little mucilage  so as  to completely conceal the incision that had been made  and obliterate  every evidence of the envelope s having been tampered with  this done   he slowly  and with apparent great caution as to the conformation of the  letters  directed it  and when he found the ink to be completely dried   enclosed the whole in the letter that he had just written  placing it   in turn  in a larger envelope which he hastily directed to some party   from whom he apparently cared but little to conceal his hand writing   this accomplished  he called for some brandy  and after paying liberally  for it and the use of the room  directed his steps towards a stationer s  shop where he purchased a postage stamp which he attached to his letter   here  also  he heard the subject of the threatened invasion of the  province discussed in all its bearings and probable results  and here   too  the bitter murmurs of discontent regarding the criminal conduct of  the individual to whom the whole interests of the country were entrusted  by the people and the crown  and who was said to have been already for  weeks in a condition of mind and body absolutely loathsome  not wishing   however  to delay the mailing of his letter  he soon found himself  wending his way to the post office  where  with his own hand  he  consigned the missive to the care of her majesty the queen  by putting  it in the apperture that opened into the letter box from the street  the  office being already closed  on this  he retraced his steps towards  the harp  where he so managed to thrust himself in among the struggling  suspicions of o brien  as to almost gain the full confidence of that  generous patriot and banish the last doubt from his breast      well   said tom  when he found a fitting opportunity   how did you find  the poor fellow       willing enough to leave the province   whispered philip   if he could  only manage to get away  but i think that will be easily arranged now   as the storm about his desertion has blown over        on the night after that of to morrow  then   returned tom   they will  make the attimpt  and as i can get a man to help them who knows every  turn and crank of the river  i have hopes of their success  besides it  will be nick s night for guard  and there s somethin in that  you know   as they can get out at the point where he stands  without much throuble  to themselves or anyone else  however   he observed farther   i hope no  one will let the cat out of the bag  as it would be a cryin sin to  have the poor fellows  nabbed  at the very moment when they fancied  themselves about to brathe the purest air that ever floated benathe the  canopy of heaven       there s no fear of that   replied greaves   for you and i only know of  their intentions  although i feel that you are not exactly at home with  me yet  for all your friendly conduct and information  but recollect   that i ll perform my part of the contract  and it is for you and them to  do the rest      this speech made tom feel a little awkward  and he was about to make a  suitable reply  when he was happily relieved by some parties who dropped  in  to command the attention he so willingly accorded at the moment     that greaves puzzled and perplexed him there could be no doubt  but at  no period could that individual elicit from him any information  if  he possessed such  in relation to fenianism  he  of course  knew that  philip learned from barry that there were many soldiers in the fort who  sympathised warmly with ireland  but this was as far as he was informed  in the matter  it was obvious  however  that for some reason or other   he was anxious to fathom the depths of the actual organization  if such  existed in or about the city  but in every attempt he was foiled  for   notwithstanding his most subtle attacks  he was met at each turn by a  spirit of reticence which baffled all his ingenuity and led him to the  conclusion that  after all  there were perhaps but slight grounds for  believing that the brotherhood had any very extensive footing in the  colony     tom sometimes reasoned  that his solicitude on this head was prompted by  patriotic motives  and then  again  the idea used to creep in upon him  that he sought this information for sinister purposes  and thus the  worthy host  trembling in the balance between the two impressions   kicked the beam on the side of prudence  and if he knew anything of  the movements and intentions of the organization  kept it to himself   although the letter in the possession of greaves might  were he less  cautious  have drawn from him some serious information  for tom o brien  was  at that moment  the centre of a fenian circle  with three hundred  armed men at his command  ready to join the invaders the instant they  entered the province and planted their standard near him upon british  soil  this being the case  he was well aware of the intentions of the  brotherhood in the united states  and thus it was  that when he found  barry could not procure his discharge before the invaders were upon  them  he instantly endorsed the project of his desertion  well knowing  that  should he fail to escape before the hour of the movement arrived   he should be called to take the field against his countrymen and against  ireland  and  perhaps  under circumstances that might preclude the  possibility of his acting otherwise than as their enemy  nor did he  relax in his watchfulness and caution when greaves even brought the  deserter to the harp in redemption of his word  or  more remarkable  still  when he learned  on the morning succeeding the night of their  escape from the fort  that seven soldiers of the regiment had bid  their commanding officer an unexpected and unceremonious adieu  and  notwithstanding that the garrison was all but alive with sentries and  guards patroling every avenue which led from it  made good their escape  to the american shore  where they were now beyond the reach of the  canadian or imperial authorities     no sooner had philip ascertained that the party had made good their  escape  than he himself prepared to bid good bye to the harp  o brien  was not at all surprised at this sudden resolution  as greaves had  professed to be daily transacting business  which he asserted might  be brought to a close at any moment  and so he had been transacting  business  for he might have been seen occasionally entering  by stealth   a certain dwelling in the outskirts of the city where fenianism and all  irish nationalists had their deadliest enemy  but  as already intimated   this enemy had been rendered powerless by the wine cup for some time  past  so that if there had been any matter of importance to transact  between them  it would have been useless to have even approached it   still philip called and called  but to no purpose  so finding that  he had pressing matters in another direction to claim his immediate  attention  he left the mystified functionary in disgust  casting  a glance at the numerous unopened dispatches on his table  and  congratulating canada on the possession of such a creditable and  efficient  leading officer     shaking hands with tom  then  after having honestly liquidated his bill   our mysterious friend soon found himself on board a train bound direct  for toronto  where he arrived in due course  amid hosts of rumors  and  military movements which were being accomplished in that reckless and  inefficient haste  that went to prove a screw loose somewhere  here he  found himself on the evening of the   th  and being obliged to remain  in the city all the next day  he started the following morning for the  west  when he learned  while journeying onwards  that the fenian forces  were massed at buffalo and along the american frontier  and that a  descent upon fort erie was sure to take place within a very few hours   although he had intended to reach his destination before night  he  was delayed at the various stations  by rumors which tended to make it  important for the train not to proceed in haste  it having been alleged   more than once  that the fenian army was already in the province  and  burning and destroying all before it  in turn  however  each of these  rumors was contradicted  and so the cars proceeded until another was  encountered  in this way the morning of the first of june overtook  him before he had yet reached the point for which he was bound  now   however  he ascertained that the province was  without any manner of  doubt  invaded by the army of the irish republic  and that even then the   sunburst  was flying over the village of fort erie     this intelligence seemed to confound him  and to have exceeded anything  that he could have anticipated  he hod fancied that  notwithstanding all  the rumors he had heard within the last few months  there was no real  intention on the part of the irish nationalists of the united states to  actually invade the province  and believed the reports of their  having congregated upon the american frontier as either unfounded or  tremendously exaggerated  now  nevertheless  they were within a very  few miles of him  and might be upon him and the neighborhood he was  approaching  at any moment     there was something in this latter conviction that appeared to move him  greatly as he stepped off the train at port colborne  where he found the  inhabitants in a state of the direst alarm  being a stranger  and unable  or unwilling to account very clearly for his sudden presence here  and  at a juncture when suspicion was so rife and every new comer subjected  to the closest scrutiny  he was put under surveillance and not permitted  to leave the village  as he was about to do  until he had explained his  business to the authorities  chafing with disappointment and anger  he  was taken into custody and confined in one of the rooms of his  hotel  until a magistrate could be found to look into his case  here   notwithstanding his protestations and willingness to prove that he was a  loyal british subject and one of importance too  he was detained nearly  the whole day  tormented by the uncomfortable misgiving that perhaps   after all his generalship  nicholas barry might again be in the province  and at a point  too  where he should be able to frustrate all the plans  he had laid so deeply and executed for so far with the utmost secrecy  and success  at last  however  a magistrate was found and a private  investigation of his case granted  the examination was brief  for  scarcely had that functionary been closeted five minutes with him   before he was set at liberty and again stepped forth a free man     so utterly helpless were the people of the section of the country in  which he now was  that they must have fallen before any considerable  force of the invaders  had such entered the province  the greatest  distrust obtained among themselves  there being a strong body of irish  and irish sympathisers in their midst  who scarcely cared to hide their  sentiments  and although there was an element in the little town that  was truly loyal to the crown  yet it is still a matter of doubt as to  its having been in the ascendant  in so far as numbers were concerned   true  that if the census of the place had been taken at the moment  and  the tendencies of every man registered according to a public statement   extracted from his own lips  england should have carried the day by an  overwhelming majority  as  on the same basis  she should at this present  hour throughout the whole of the new dominion  but had one glimpse of a  victorious irish army been caught in the distance  the case would have  been widely different  indeed  and those who were constrained  through  the force of circumstances  to fall into line with the paid  official  squad who ruled the roast for the time being  would soon hoist their  true colors and step out beneath the folds of that glorious banner of  green and gold before which  with all her boasting armaments  the  tyrant power of england now trembles to its very base  and so it will be  throughout the colony at large  whenever the irish nationalists  or any  other people inimical to england  enter it with a view to tearing down  the skull and cross bones of st  george  and ultimately replacing it  with the proud and invincible banner of the united states of america   not a single doubt obtains in well informed quarters on this head  so  that the tyrant england cannot fail to be swept ultimately from this  continent  never to lift her dishonored head upon its free  historic  shores again     and what wonder that the thinking portion of the people of canada  men  who have its material prosperity and its happiness at heart  should  long for a union with this republic  with which their interests are so  intimately identified  and upon which they are almost solely dependant  for a market and that good will that is not only necessary to their  peace  but to their very existence  shut out from the ocean  that great  highway of nations  for six months of the year  they are  almost daily   at the mercy of the united states for any description of commercial  intercourse  or exchange of thought  in relation to the material  condition of the continent or their own probable future  lying a frozen  strip against the north pole  with all their available lands settled  if  we are to credit the assertions made by their own statesmen  were this  great republic to close its doors against them  they should be obviously  cut off  in a measure  from all civilization  and dwarfed both mentally  and physically into the most contemptible dimensions  as it is  they are  depending upon america for every refining and practical influence that  warms their partial life  or gives any value whatever to their social  status  american literature  tastes  habits  inventions and even foibles  color all their internal intercourse  although the fact does not seem  apparent to those who are interested in perpetuating british rule  amongst them  and is denied by others from motives of envy or vanity   add to this the circumstance that their government is the most wretched  that could possibly be found among a people professing to be free   scarce a single department of it but is stained with fraud of the  vilest description to the very lips  and neither more nor less than an  instrument of public plunder in the hands of corrupt officials  even  while we write  and for years back  a charge lies in the department of  the minister of finance  against the present premier of the dominion   accusing that unscrupulous individual of conspiring with a whisky  dealer   while he himself was first minister of the crown   to defraud  the revenue  a charge made by the present assistant commissioner of  customs and excise  whom this same premier has been obliged to retain  in office to the present hour  with a view to saving himself from  disclosures calculated to drive him from office in disgrace  so dreadful  have been the circumstances of this case  that when an offer was made  subsequently  through the public press  to produce bank  official and  mercantile evidence that the government functionary who preferred this  frightful accusation was dishonest and incompetent  and that he had  purloined public documents and destroyed them with a view to concealing  his crimes  still this premier dared not summon him to trial  although   times without number  he gave assurances  as did the then inspector  general  that the culprit should be brought before the proper tribunal   and justice done in the premises  but why need we complain  when canada  takes the matter so coolly  for will it be believed  that these two  worthies  both the accused and the accuser  both disfigured by the most  damning accusations  are still in the pay of the canadian people  and  have been so ever since the circumstances of their official character  were laid through the daily press before the world  not a single move  has yet been made in the direction of justice  nor an inquiry instituted  as to the truth or falsehood of these frightful charges  the premier  still carries the filthy load upon his shoulders  while his subordinate   of the stolen bank receipts and false report  laughs in his sleeve at  the rod that he holds over his naked shoulders     nor is this more than an individual case amongst others of a similar  class  what of the tens of thousands of the people s money given   without the sanction of parliament  to the grand trunk railway in the  interest of english stockholders  and the postal subsidies handed over  to the same line  in excess of the tender made by the managing director  for the carrying of her majesty s mails  was not the government liberal  with the hard earnings of their poor dupes throughout the land  when  they virtually informed the authorities of the grand trunk that they  were altogether too modest in their estimates  and that the country  ought not to take advantage of such nice young men  but give them more  than they asked for performing the service mentioned  glorious  wasn t  it  we might also allude to the manner in which sir john a  taxed  the struggling industry of the province  millions to build up his pet  parliament houses at the back of god speed  buildings that almost rival  those of england  and refer also to the delightful manner in which the  crown lands were dealt with by another member of this happy family   citing the case of the wallace mine claim  in which the commissioner  managed to dispose  at a mere nominal figure  of a portion of the public  domain by private sale among a few of his friends  including a gentleman  presumed to be his own agent  and that  too  in the face of a law which  made it imperative upon the government to advertise all lands in the   canada gazette  before they were put upon the market  for appearance  sake  the lands were advertised in the  gazette   but when a purchaser  dropped in to make inquiries  it leaked out that they had been all  disposed of previously  in this way the business of the people has been  conducted for years  and what is the result  to day they are without  immigration  trade or commerce  to day there is no public confidence  existing in any portion of the dominion  for the government seem to  grasp the purse strings with one hand while they hold a drawn sword in  the other  there is no security to be found in any corner of the state   and no projects  formed for the future of its people  to be sure   certain parties prate and jabber about the volunteer service and  national defenses  but what have they to defend  if their frontier were  bristling to morrow with forts and bayonets  all they could hope to  accomplish would be the shutting out of american liberty and national  prosperity from the people  this must be self evident to any individual  who is at all conversant with the true nature of the case  or cognizant  of the fact  that there cannot possibly be any hope for canada so long  as she holds herself aloof from the great social and political compact  of this union  upon the pulses of which  in her present helpless and  isolated position  she will always have to dance attendance and pay the  piper besides  either the sunlight or the shadow of the republic must  fall on her without intermission  if she choose the former  well and  good  let her cut herself free of the despotic tyrant that now holds  her in cunning thrall  and step into the broad effulgence of american  freedom  or if she will it  until circumstances of themselves  precipitate her into the arms of the commonwealth with less grace than  she might otherwise have fallen into them  let her feel the blighting  influence of the cold clouds that cannot fail to envelope her and  paralyze all her energies in the interim  there is no need of mincing  the matter  canada beneath the skull and cross bones of st  george  must  ever remain a poor  puny starveling  while under the proud and ample  folds of the glorious flag of this mighty republic  she should at once  become great  powerful and prosperous  as yet another star added to the  refulgent galaxy that now rides high amid the noontide of nations           chapter xii       one grand evidence of the deep rooted sentiment that actuates fenianism  in the great irish american heart  is to be found in the fact  that at  the time of the pittsburgh convention  the organization was in debt   and that within the brief space intervening between that period and the  invasion of canada  the brotherhood armed and equipped thousands upon  thousands of their number  and still had not expended the last dollar  in their treasury  this is  of itself  a most significant fact  and one  that goes far to exalt the irish element on this continent in the eyes  of both soldiers  citizens and statesmen  the abiding faith of our  people in the justice of their cause  and the fixed conviction that it  shall one day triumph  enable them to deal with reverses and opposition  in a manner at once intelligent  dignified and philosophic  they know  that repeated failures have been the crucible in which the holiest and  the most successful projects have been tried in all ages  and  like that  of the spider of bruce  the heart never fails within them  amongst them   too  were found upon the eve of their descent upon the province  as  well as long previous to it  men of undoubted patriotism  genius and  chivalry  and at no point was this more obvious than at buffalo  we say   more obvious  for we know that scarce a city  town or village in the  state  and far and wide outside it  but contained just us good men and  true as were possessed by buffalo  but we refer to it thus particularly   as it is more immediately connected with our tale  we could mention many  names as sterling in every relation as those we now introduce  but none   we apprehend  more intimately blended with the actual descent of the  brave o neill upon canada  save the handful of heroes who joined him  in that proud and daring expedition  and none which  in the hour of  the sorest need of the organization  sacrificed more for the sake of  ireland     when the moment was considered ripe for the movement  then  the eyes of  the fenian authorities were turned towards buffalo  and other points  on the frontier lying close upon the canadian borders  in this city   francis b  gallagher  esq   and five or six others were regarded as  marked personages towards which a peculiar portion of the movement  should gravitate before finally crossing the lines  these gentlemen   from their independent circumstances  excellent social standing and  undoubted patriotism  were regarded as pillars of strength upon which  the expedition might properly lean for a moment  and adjust itself  before attempting to cross the rubicon and enter the country of the  enemy  there were more  also  in this city  who evinced a spirit of the  truest love of ireland upon that occasion  as upon all previous once   and who assisted in forwarding the grand objects of the organization  to the utmost stretch of their abilities  but as their names are too  numerous to mention here  and as they had their counterpart  as they  have to day  in various localities throughout the union  we shall merely  note the circumstance of their existence  as to the brotherhood in  its military aspect here  no portion of the state or union was better  represented in this connection  or more competent to distinguish itself  upon the field  its civil relations  also  were equally creditable  mr   gallagher  as the period for action approached  becoming active  anxious  and restless  devoting his time assiduously to the affairs of the  brotherhood  and constantly communicating with headquarters on some  point of importance  and thus affairs stood when the first draft of  men arrived in the city under senator bannon  of louisville  ky   and  senator fitzgerald  of cincinnati  and when the movement on canada might  be said to have fairly commenced     soon  however  it began to be discovered that  although buffalo  and  other places  were alive to their duty and ready to contribute their  quota to the expedition  there was a screw loose somewhere  and on the  evening of the thirty first of may  it was ascertained that  although  numbers of volunteers had arrived from various points  through the  unfortunate neglect or incapacity of the then secretary of war  there  was no one to command them  this was a dreadful state of affairs indeed   and one which admits of no palliation  it was expected that general  lynch  or some other distinguished officer  would take charge of the  expedition from this point  but that gallant and experienced soldier   owing to the receipt of incorrect orders  did not arrive in time to  assume the command  up to this point  and for some time previously   matters had been conducted in a manner so careless by the war  department  that the mere casual observer might reasonably presume some  parties connected with it courted failure  arms and ammunition had been  despatched to the frontier without due precaution  and to parties to  whom they ought not have been transmitted  for various reasons  again   the massing of forces at the various points of debarkation was neither  compact nor simultaneous   a circumstance which occasioned so much  delay  that the american government could not possibly close their eyes  to the fact of the invasion  without compromising themselves before  the world  had one simultaneous and compact movement characterized the  expedition  the american authorities would never have interfered with  it  but when it was rubbed under their nose for days  through the  blundering or criminality of those who undertook to direct it from the  war department  what was to have been expected other than is now known  to have occurred     in addition to this  no transport had been actually secured for the  troops that had arrived at buffalo  and the dilemma was intensified  to the extremest pitch  what ship owner  in the face of such bungling   would run the risk of placing any of his vessels at the disposal of a  party so uncomfortably situated  that was a question which presented  itself at the last moment  and which was more easily put than answered     when all was dark and uncertain  however  and when the heart of many  began to fail  in stepped the gallant o neill upon the platform   offering to command the expedition  he had arrived previously from  nashville  tenn   with his contingent  and felt how dreadful the  position in which the project was placed  a council of war was held   at which captain hynes was present  and as this latter gentleman had  delegated authority from gen  sweeney  colonel o neill  now general  was  at once placed in command  so far so good  but how were the troops to  get across the river  the interrogatory  as already observed  was a  perplexing one  but it was instantly solved by mr  gallagher and one or  two other gentlemen  who voluntarily  and at the imminent risk of every  dollar they possessed  pledged all they were worth in the world  and  procured the necessary means for crossing the river  and landing the  first instalment of the army of the irish republic upon british soil     the number of men assembled at buffalo on the night already mentioned  was about eight hundred   being detachments from the following  regiments     th infantry  colonel john o neill    th infantry  colonel  owen stan    th infantry  lieutenant colonel grace   th infantry   colonel john hoy  and two companies from indiana  under captain  haggerty  but the number of men that could be gotten together when the  expedition crossed did not exceed six hundred     an authentic report of this brief but glorious campaign will be found at  the close of this work  we introduce it as historical information  from  a most unerring source  the subject  it will be perceived  is treated  in the most impartial and unimpassioned manner  dealing simply in dry  details  and in that curt  soldier like matter of fact style  which aims  at nothing like effect  and seeks only to recount circumstances as they  occurred  and that  too  in the briefest possible manner     scarcely had the last boat  with the invading expedition  pushed off  from the american shore  on the night of the   st of may  already  mentioned  when another craft  pulled by two men  its only occupants   followed in the wake of the receding troops  dropping a little further  down the river  as it neared the canadian side  from their dress and  appearance  the rowers might have been recognized by many a buffalonian   as black jack and the kid  who were evidently bent upon dogging the  invaders  and  while keeping at a safe distance  dealing in such plunder  on their outskirts as might swell their own villainous coffers  while  the criminality should attach to the fenians  this course was prompted  on their part by a sort of blind  bull dog adherence to everything  english  and a hope of picking up in the red trail of the campaign such  valuables as would increase their already large though ill gotten store     on reaching the canadian shore  both these worthies  who had but a few  nights previously conveyed kate across the niagara  set out for the  village of fort erie  which lay about four miles up the river  and which  they did not wish to approach directly from the american side  but creep  towards in the rear of the moving mass     under no circumstances does the human wolf exhibit itself to such  monstrous intensity as under those of war  not the wolf in the uniform  of the soldier  for  let him be as blood thirsty as he may  he buys  on  the field  to some extent at least  the right to be savage  the current  coin in which he deals is human gore  and in this relation he freely  exchanges with his antagonist the circulating medium  and gives or  takes  as the necessities of the moment may demand  he stands a nine pin  on the great bowling alley of the field  and takes his chance of being  knocked down in common with his opponent  who occupies a precisely  similar position  he offers life for life  and  lamentable as the  doctrine may be  he seems licensed to plunder  and  if needs be  kill   here  of course  we speak of the mere hireling  who has no higher object  before him than that of simple gain  who is actuated solely by a sordid  love of gold  whose soul and body are as purchasable as a pound of beef  in the shambles  and who is moved by the wretched pulses of mammon only   such an one  although low in the scale of humanity  and unworthy  of being mentioned in the same breath with the glorious patriot who  unsheathes his sword for father land  liberty and heaven  is an angel  of light compared with the lynx eyed  dastardly prowler  who  when the  heart of his quarry has been stilled by some other hand  gropes  gloved  with clotted sore  among the mangled remains for the booty he never  earned  or who  when the thunder of the field  or the onward course of  a victorious army lays waste the fair land  takes advantage of the dread  and confusion of the inhabitants  and gorges himself with plunder  as  though he were a victor to whom should belong the spoils  such wreckers  of the dead are the ghouls of our race  and never had they more faithful  representatives than the two villains who  in due course  mingled with  the invaders in the village  anxious to commence their depredations  before even a single shot was fired     barry  as already intimated  joined the expedition  and was now numbered  among the invaders  of course he perceived that with such a mere handful  of men  nothing could be effected in the province  but  then  he  never supposed for a moment  that they were other than the simple  advance guard of a numerous following close upon their rear  in  addition  it was anticipated that the landing of troops upon the  canadian shore would be effected simultaneously along the frontier at  different points  this was the settled conviction of o neill  and of his  officers also  as the scheme formed a leading feature of the  programme of the campaign  but here the fates were against them  for  transportation  as we are led to believe  was not secured effectively  at any point save buffalo  in fact  this city appears to have acquitted  itself with regard to the invasion  in a manner that reflects the  highest credit upon the fenian authorities of the district  for even  when the expedition  on finding that the american government had  interfered with the transport of reinforcements  had considered it  prudent to return  the means of reaching the american shore were placed  at its command by the patriotic gentlemen already alluded to  while   farther still  when the united states authorities were seizing the arms  of the brotherhood in every direction  buffalo  through the admirable  management of these persons  contrived to keep its quota intact     during the morning of the landing  nicholas happened to get a glimpse  of the kid and big dark companion in the village  and the circumstance  awoke strong hopes in his bosom in relation to gaining some intelligence  of kate  from all he had heard  and from having found the trinket in  their boat  he felt convinced that either one or the other of these  scoundrels knew something of her  he  therefore  kept track of them  until a fitting opportunity  when he accosted the kid  as a sort of  half acquaintance  and  by way of attempting to surprise him into a  confession of some knowledge of kate  produced the silver chased button  already referred to  and asked him if he knew the name of the lady that  had recently dropped it in his boat  for a moment the villain  who was   of course  none other than the stephen smith that was in the habit  of visiting the wilsons  seemed taken aback  but instantly recovering  himself  replied  that his boat was so often hired by fishing parties   it would be difficult to tell the name of the lady from whose dress it  might have dropped  that was   provided it had dropped from a lady s  dress  at all      although the thrust was adroitly parried  nicholas  who was on the  qui  vive   noticed his momentary confusion  and determined to keep his eye  upon him  in the hope that something might soon turn up that would throw  the villain more completely into his power  and enable him to extract  from him the intelligence which he still felt satisfied was in his  possession  with this end in view  he set one of his comrades  who had  escaped from the fort with him  to watch with the utmost caution  and secrecy every manoeuvre of the wretch and his companion  fully  satisfied  as he was  that both the rascals were determined to follow in  the wake of the army  for purposes already mentioned     the conduct of the invaders at fort erie was of such general excellence   that the inhabitants of that place speak of them  up to the  present hour  in terms of such admiration as to excite the  jealous animadversions of many of the canadian people themselves   notwithstanding that the village and its vicinity lay helplessly at  their disposal  and was  for the moment  theirs by right of conquest   they entered it rather in the character of guests than in that of  masters  although the usages of war placed all that it contained at  their feet  they never appropriated to their use even one solitary loaf  of bread or glass of ale without having first paid for it  as to their  generosity and chivalry in this connection  let us quote from the work  of major george t  denison  jun r  commanding  the governor general s  body guard   upper canada  author of  manual and outpost duties     observations on the best defensive force for canada   c    an officer  who took part in the campaign against the fenians  and who cannot be  charged with partiality to the invaders  in this work  published in  june        by rollo   adam  toronto  and entitled  the fenian raid on  fort erie  with an account of the battle of ridgeway   the author   page     observes  first  as to the disastrous result of the collision  between both armies  to the canadians        the loss of this fight was the loss of the whole expedition  the two  commanding officers were wandering about the country  the main body of  the men captured or lying wounded about the village  the captain of the  artillery struck down with the loss of a leg  and the tug almost denuded  of men  and the few left so hampered with a lot of useless prisoners  as  to be unable to undertake anything      and again  after having complimented the invaders on some instances of  personal bravery  he remarks  page         before closing this chapter  i must mention that  from all accounts   the fenians  except in so far as they were wrong in invading a peaceful  country  in carrying on an unjustifiable war  behaved remarkably well  to the inhabitants  i spent three weeks in fort erie  and conversed with  dozens of the people of the place  and was astonished at the universal  testimony borne by them to their unvarying good conduct  they have been  called plunderers  robbers and marauders  yet  no matter how unwilling  we may be to admit it  the positive fact remains  that they stole but  few valuables  that they destroyed  comparatively speaking  little or  nothing  and that they committed no outrages upon the inhabitants  but  treated everyone with unvarying courtesy  on taking a number of the  welland battery and the naval company prisoners  they treated them  with the greatest kindness  putting the officers under their parole  and returning to them their side arms  taking them down to the wharf on  their departure  and releasing them  bidding them adieu with expressions  of good will       another incident   he goes on to say  same page   occurred  worth  mentioning  a number of them went to a widow lady s house  near fort  erie  and asked her for something to eat  they were about going into the  kitchen to sit down  and she told them she would not let them in   they  laughingly replied   very well  ma am  we ll do here very well  it is a  very nice yard   and accordingly they sat down on the grass and ate the  bread and butter and milk she gave them  another squad in the same  way took breakfast there  in the evening a man came  ragged and tired   looking for something to eat  seeing a loaf of bread on the table he  took it up  the lady said   that is the last loaf i have   the man  looked at her and said slowly   is that the last loaf of bread that you  have  then i ll not take it   and laid it on the window sill  seeing  this  she asked him to take half  after pressing it upon him  he at  length took a portion of it  this story is undoubtly true  as i obtained  it from the lady herself  with whom i am intimately acquainted       it perhaps   he continues in the next paragraph  page      does  not come with a good grace from a canadian to give any credit to the  fenians  who  without any ground of complaint against us  invade our  country and cause the loss of valuable lives among us  but as a truthful  narrator of facts  i must give them credit on the only ground on which  they can claim it      this is honest and soldierly on the part of major denison  but should  these pages chance to meet his eye  he will find his theory untenable in  relation to the immunity of canada from the consequences of any acts for  which england may seemingly be responsible only  the war of      was  not a war against canada  but against great britain  and yet canada was  invaded by the americans and made the principal theatre of the  conflict  how multifarious soever  or widely scattered its colonies or  dependencies  every nation is a unit  and consequently amenable as well  in detail as in the aggregate  for any offence committed against public  justice or humanity  when you quarrel with a man  you don t quarrel in  particular with his eye  his foot  or his nose  although you may punish  him as a whole by inflicting injury upon all or any of these organs  and  thus it is in the case under consideration  the new dominion is the foot  or the eye or the nose of john bull  and as such  any enemy of england  is justifiable in maiming him in any or all of these parts  this is  the hard logic of the point  and if canada wishes to escape its  consequences  she must demonstrate to the irish people  or to any other  who may be at enmity with england  that she is neither part nor parcel  of the british empire  how ridiculous the plea set up by canada  that  because she was not forsooth an active individual agent of gross tyranny  and injustice towards ireland  she ought to be exempt from any of the  consequences arising to the real culprit in the case  the same argument  might be urged with as much reason  by half the population of england  herself  who are just as innocent in this respect as the people of  canada  they having never been consciously concerned in any oppression  of ireland  either individually or collectively  but they are the  friends  allies and abettors of the government which has perpetrated  such crimes in relation to ireland   nay  more  they create and sustain  the agencies through which these wrongs are committed  and in this  they are joined heart  hand and soul  by the people of canada or the  representatives of that people  canada  then  having sworn allegiance to  the crown of great britain  is constructively  as well as virtually   as much an enemy of ireland as england is  the firm  comprising great  britain and all its colonies and dependencies throughout the world  is  known as john bull   co   and the distinctive sign of the house  in all  its ramifications  is the union jack or some adaptation of the red  cross of st  george to local predilections  as in ordinary mercantile  transactions  a debt incurred by any branch of the establishment  involves the responsibility of the whole  and can be levied for  in london or hokitika  this is the true state of the case  and any  individual who would advance a doctrine contrary to it  is either a  simpleton or a knave     black jack and his companion were astonished to find such order reign in  the midst of an invading army  and to perceive that the inhabitants  of the village were not subjected to instant plunder  if not fire and  sword  by the troops now in possession of the place  they had come over  in the hope of being able to make some bold strokes in the wake of the  soldiery  and the confusion that they had fancied should obtain among  the people  but finding that they were foiled in this direction  they  cast their eyes about them to see what was best to be done under the  circumstances      i ll be blowed   growled jack  as they both rambled in the outskirts  of the village the morning of their arrival   if this ain t a go  honly  fancy  kid  vot a set of spoonies these  ere fellows har  not to be goin  it like the hinglish in hindia  or in the peninsoola under the duke  i   eard a fellow as vos there say  that they used to steal hoff at night  and  av hodd sport and leave none to tell the tale in the mornin   glorious  vosn t it  and then ven they gathered hup the svag  they  made it hall right vith the sentries and sometimes vith the hofficers  themselves       jack  i ll never make anything of you   returned the kid   your  language is so vulgar  and your address altogether so ungentlemanlike   that you at once peach on yourself  for anybody  with even half an eye   that either sees you or hears you speak  would take you for the villain  you unquestionably are       oh  bless ee  but you re a sveet cove   rejoined jack   and no vun  vould suppose for a moment that you cut sal gordon s throat  the night  you coaxed her hoff to marry her  just because you took a fancy to a  couple of five pun notes she had in her trash bag that she refused to  give hup afore the knot vos tied       come  come   winced the kid   no more of that  but let us see if we  can t do a little business here  or  at least  before we return  which  i venture to say we shall manage if we keep in the wake of these fellows  without arousing the suspicions of any of them       yes  yes   said jack   but vot hif ve should run foul of the henemy and  be taken hup as belongin to these  ere chaps  hif so be they re beaten   as i hope they vill       i tell you what  there s but one chap among them all that ll keep  his eye on us   replied the kid   and that s the fellow who thought to  surprise me into a confession  by suddenly producing a button that  i  apprehend  dropped off the dress of the lady that we  recently ran over  here for our new employer  i have found out his name  and learned that  he was engaged to be married to this same beauty  who is now safely  caged at wilson s  where she ll soon be apt to learn that she s in about  as nice a fix as ever she was in during her life  but   he continued   i  don t know what to make of that martha  all i can do or say  whenever i  happen to be at the house  has no other effect than that of apparently  making her more and more opposed to her uncle s wishes  until i am  convinced shell never be mine  willingly at least  and after all  i love  the girl well enough  although i feel i should kill her before she was  mine a month      thus baffled and circumscribed  these two scoundrels prowled about the  village until near ten o clock  when the troops moved down the river  about four miles  and went into camp at newbiggin s farm  at this period  the gallant o neill was in great uncertainty  here he was in an enemy s  country with but a handful of men  and in utter darkness as to what was  going on at other points  already  at buffalo  he had a taste of the  manner in which the war department had conducted the expedition to  that point  and was  of course  afraid that the inefficiency of that  department would make itself apparent in more relations than one  in  the ability  activity and devotion of president roberts  vice president  gibbons and the senate  he had the fullest confidence  but col  roberts  did not take it upon himself to dictate to a department that was in  charge of what was believed to be an old and experienced military  officer  and one on whose judgment and practical skill he placed the  fullest reliance  the position was a desperate one  but o neill was  determined to maintain his ground on british soil  until satisfied that  failure had obtained elsewhere  and that there was no probability of his  being reinforced  he had long burned for an opportunity of meeting the  enemies of the land of his birth in open fight  and now  although all  around looked dark and uncertain  he was determined to join issue with  any force that was brought against him  his men for the most part  too   shared this sentiment  true  that a few cowardly hounds had deserted his  standard almost as soon as it had been unfurled on the enemy s  shore  but then these were of that miserable breed that always attach  themselves to expeditions of this sort without measuring their motives  or the strength of their principles  however  be this as it may  they  have forever forfeited their claims to the name of irishmen  if such  they were  while the very recollection will be painful to many  that so  dastardly and worthless a crew tainted  even for a single moment  the  pure atmosphere in which such men breathed as the following  not to  speak of the noble rank and file whose names we are unable  for obvious  reasons  to give here  and who  like them  led by the gallant o neill   immortalized themselves on the field of ridgeway      officers of the i r a   present at ridgeway        lieutenant

should ever appear that we have done so  it will be a  source of great pain to us  although we can plead in apology that every  effort was made on our part to procure a complete list     seeing that there was not much to be made out of fort erie  the two  comrades  black jack and the kid  moved cautiously in the rear of the  troops as they fell down the river  their intention being to remain  concealed in the vicinity of any point at which an engagement might take  place  and then trust to chance for an opportunity of rifling the dead  or picking up whatever spoils happened to drop in their way  while  deliberating upon this creditable resolve  about noon  as they had made  a detour and pushed ahead of the troops  who were going into camp  their  attention was arrested by the noise of some vehicle coming up a side  road across which they were wending their way  in the course of a few  moments they discovered that it was the wagon of wilson  driven by that  worthy  in the direction of the village of waterloo  he evidently not  having  as yet  heard of the province being invaded  immediately a  conference took place between the three friends  when it was agreed that  wilson s wagon should be concealed in a wooded hollow close by  and that  it should be made the receptacle of whatever plunder might be  secured during the struggle that they all felt must soon take place   consequently  the team was turned aside  and  after being unhitched  was  secured in a close clump of trees  that was not likely to be visited by  any persons in the vicinity  and more particularly so  when the country  was now being alarmed throughout  and people were securing themselves in  their habitations     after this being arranged  and the horses fed and watered  the party  again sallied forth towards the main road  with a view to getting  as near as was safe to the camp of the invaders  and gleaning some  information as to their future movements  they had been hovering about  in this way for some time  when they came to a point where two roads  met  and where they perceived two wagons in which were a number of  people  all standing and reconoitering something  in alarm or surprise   through a field glass  which they were passing from one to the other   at a glance the trio saw that these persons were canadians  and  fearing  nothing  they made instantly towards them  and as though in ignorance of  what had taken place  made inquiries as to what they were inspecting     while engaged in conversation upon this point  and learning that those  in the wagons were observing a body of armed men who were moving at some  distance from them  but whom they could not identify as either friends  or foes  the whole party perceived an officer riding towards them with  the greatest apparent coolness and confidence  on coming up  he informed  them that the body of men in the distance were some volunteers who were  not very well acquainted with the roads about there  and that he would  feel obliged if they would just drive down and give the commanding  officer whatever information was in their power upon the subject of the  best route to be taken to a certain point  naming it  to this request  they all gladly acceded  the kid and jack not daring to say a word  and  not one of them suspecting anything from the peculiar uniform of the  officer  from the fact that they were not aware the hat indicated that  he did not belong to any canadian force  believing  as they did  that  the uniforms of the volunteers were of various descriptions  when   however  they arrived at the point where the men were stationed  they  quickly found out their mistake  and  to their utter consternation  were  all made prisoners  wilson and his two companions included  the body  that made this capture was a reconnoitering force commanded by col  john  hoy  and no sooner was it made  than the prisoners and the two wagons  were at once forwarded under an escort to o neill s camp  where  on the  kid and black jack being recognized as belonging to buffalo  they were  released at once  the others being held for a short period with a view  to gaining some information from them  relative to the movements or  whereabouts of the enemy  of which  as it subsequently turned out  they  knew nothing whatever     this introduction to the camp was considered fortunate by the kid and  his comrade  who now  on being acknowledged by some of the men who knew  nothing of their real character  seemed anxious to remain under the  protection of the irish flag until  as they stated  they could effect  their escape across the river  as they now averred that  should they  attempt to regain buffalo alone  they could not fail to fall into the  hands of the canadian forces  who  it was rumored  were gathering on  every side of the fenian army  with the design of surrounding it and  cutting off its retreat  this all seemed natural and reasonable enough   and more particularly as the two villains asserted that they were on  their way to chippewa on business of importance  but should now get back  to their home as soon as practicable  they not having had any idea that  the invasion was about to take place  and having crossed to the canadian  side early the evening before  that finding they could not get any one  to recross the river with them  as things stood  they thought it better  to keep in the wake of the army until they had reached some point where  they could effect a crossing  not wishing to entrust themselves to the  people of fort erie  after the troops had evacuated that place  as they  felt certain that the inhabitants regarded them as fenians  and would  treat them as such if an opportunity was afforded them to do so     during the day nothing of interest transpired  until towards evening   when barry  with two of his old comrades and four others of his company   who were thoroughly acquainted with the locality  were despatched  from the camp  as were similar squads in other directions  to make  reconnoissances of the enemy  if they were anywhere near the main body  of the army  after proceeding cautiously for a couple of miles  and  pausing  from time to time  to reconnoitre  on gaining the verge of a  small piece of wooded land  they suddenly found themselves almost face  to face with ten or twelve armed soldiers  in british uniform  who  seemed to be an outpost lying in wait among some pine shrubs  on the  opposite side of a narrow ravine  fortunately for our hero  he was  the first to discover the red coats  upon whom the sun was pouring its  declining rays  revealing them to the green coats  while at the same  time it dazzled and obscured their vision  from the fact that the  light flashed full in their faces  while it fell on the backs of their  advancing adversaries  a few hundred yards towards the upper end of the  ravine  there was a small patch of wood  through which barry instantly  determined to move towards the point occupied by the enemy  hoping to  be able to surprise them before they were aware of his proximity  this  manoeuvre was accomplished rapidly  and with the utmost caution  but as  an open space yet intervened between him and them  when he had gained  the verge of the grove  he determined to remain under cover  with a view  to ascertaining the strength of the force he might have to cope with   not knowing but it was larger than it seemed to be from the opposite  side of the glen     here  however  he had scarcely halted when he was discovered by the  enemy  who took alarm  but  after a moment s pause  during which a good  deal of coolness was observed amongst their ranks  they deliberately  poured a volley into the grove where he and his little band stood under  shelter  although discernible among the trees  no sooner had the music  of the bullets ceased  and as a full view was had of the force of the  enemy  than the fenians dashed across the open space already mentioned   and charged in a spirited manner  although received by the foe with  the utmost intrepidity  and an evident intention to work some mischief  before they retired from the spot  barry  however  instructed his little  band not to fire until within a few yards of their antagonists  who were  now coolly reloading  so  before the redcoats were again prepared to  give another volley  one simultaneous crash of the fenian rifles threw  them into momentary confusion  and  the next instant  both parties were  closely engaged in a life and death struggle     the fire of the fenians had made sad havoc amongst the small force   which was now cut down to the proportions of that of their own  still  those that remained never swerved an inch  but joined with their  adversaries  hip and thigh  there was but one volley fired on  either side  and  now that the shrubbery was so thick and withal so  inconveniently high  both parties had recourse to their side arms to  decide the day  hand to hand  and desperately they fought  without much  indication of the mortal strife  save the low groan of the dying and the  thick breathing of those who struggled upon the green sward among the  roots of the young pines that so thickly studded the place  already had  barry silenced forever the pulses of more than one of his antagonists   when their leader  a powerful man of about thirty five  made a sudden  bound towards him  after having in turn brought his own assailant to  the ground  and instantly both their swords were crossed  as they stood   alone  in an open space of a few feet square  while the deadly conflict  still half silently raged around them among the three or four who now  survived to battle for their respective flags     barry  although but a private soldier when in the british service  was  regarded as one of the best swordsmen in his regiment  in fact  he was  that sort of person who took delight in excelling in every military  exercise  so that his task masters should have no grounds for wounding  his feelings or his pride in any matter connected with the discipline  of a soldier  so skillful was he in this connection  that the moment  he caught sight of the manner in which his enemy grasped his weapon   he looked for but one issue touching the encounter  and that was  the  probable destruction of both  he felt that he had an antagonist before  him worthy the occasion  and braced himself for the work with all the  energy of his being  swift as lightning  both weapons flashed in the  sunlight  and the next instant lay pressing uneasily against each other  in mid air  forming a shifting and glittering arch of death  beneath  which either its crimson or emerald pillar was soon to fall in  ensanguined ruins  not a word was spoken on either side  each believing  that his hour or that of the other had come  the conflict in the  surrounding shrubbery had already almost ceased  brief as the period  was  the remaining few of the enemy were vanquished and soon had fled   pursued by a victorious two or three  being scarcely themselves more  than that number  having suffered severely  although they fought with  great bravery  it was the seven hundred years of hate and the red blood  of ireland  that decided the conquest for so far in favor of the green   and now  face to face  with lips compressed and glaring eye  stood the  two representatives of the individual antagonisms  which had been pitted  against each other for ages  and which never can breathe in peace the  same vital air  as if understanding  thoroughly  the power  agility and  skill of his antagonist  the opponent of barry  who was an englishman by  birth  and had been in the british service  never sought for a moment to  gain any advantage of the ground  in this relation  he seemed satisfied  to fight his adversary on equal terms  being well aware that a single  move might be fatal  inasmuch as it could not fail to distract his  attention to some extent from his watchful enemy  the sward sloped  down rapidly to the ravine  so that he who occupied the most elevated  position would have his adversary at an advantage  but  although this  conviction was impressed upon the minds of both  neither seemed anxious  to avail himself of it  and thus they stood upon equal terms  in every  way antagonists worthy of each other  in height  the englishman had it  somewhat in his favor  but  then  not above an inch or so  while barry   in agility and compactness  seemed to be vastly his superior  and such  they were  when the first thrust and parry told that the work had begun   this was immediately succeeded by a furious clashing  that evidenced a  rising tempest of anger in the breast of either  or both  and which gave  promise of being speedily followed by some fatal stroke that was sure to  terminate the encounter  during this ominous flurry  barry stood on  the defensive  coolly eyeing his brave adversary  and watching for the  unguarded moment when he could either kill or disarm him  but this was  not so easily found  as the englishman was every inch a soldier and a  superb swordsman  and barry knew it well     notwithstanding the violence of the attack  so adroitly was it met   and so firmly was it withstood  that our hero never gave way a hair s  breadth of ground  or suffered a single scratch  and now only  in  reality  the murderous conflict commenced  the englishman perceiving  that our hero was not to be moved or thrown off his guard for an  instant  became more fully satisfied that he had a dangerous antagonist  to deal with  and so commenced to be himself more cautions and guarded   seeing that mere personal strength availed him but little  he fell  back on his admirable swordsmanship and fought with coolness the most  undaunted  barry now  in turn  became the assailant  and pressing his  antagonist with great skill and courage  gave him a slight flesh wound   followed rapidly by another in the sword arm  from which the blood began  to flow copiously  perceiving that the conflict must be decided at once   as he should soon become faint from loss of blood  once more the red  coat became the assailing party  but this time  as he was pressing our  hero  but somewhat more feebly than before  his foot caught beneath  the tough  fibrous roots of one of the pine shrubs by which they were  surrounded  and the next instant he was thrown headlong towards barry   while his sword flew out of his hand far beyond his reach     the fight was over  and fortunate it was for the prostrate soldier that  it was brought to so singular a determination  for  from the manner  in which he was bleeding  if from nothing else  the day was sure to be  decided in barry s favor  regaining his feet  as soon as possible  he  looked aghast for a moment  as if expecting his death blow  but found  his antagonist not only presenting him his sword  but begging him not to  continue the conflict  as from his wound he was in no situation to keep  it up longer with any show of success      by my faith   he replied in return   i believe  under any  circumstances  the fates were against me  so  understanding what is due  to a brave man  keep my sword and find me some water  as i begin to feel  a little shakey about the knees      just at the foot of the slope  and but a few yards distant  there was a  brook  to which our hero now led his prisoner  and where  after bathing  his temples and bandaging his wound with a handkerchief  he left him for  a moment to look after those who might need his aid more urgently  hard  by  he found  after all  that but one of his party was killed  although  two others  who managed to creep in amongst the shrubbery  were severely  wounded  not knowing how the contest was going  and seeing themselves  completely  hors de combat   they waited in silence the result  fearing  to call out  lest the enemy might be upon them and despatch them  the  red coats suffered most severely  six of their number having been killed  outright  strange to say  however  that there appeared to have been none  of them simply wounded  for  although groans were heard to proceed from  the point where they lay  they must have been uttered in their death  agonies  so mortal was the damage dealt them     when this much was ascertained  barry was deliberating as to what had  become of the remaining three of his party  when they returned to the  scene of conflict  weary with a fruitless chase  these men instantly  took up their comrades and bore them down to the brook  where they  were refreshed with a cooling draught  barry  finding that it would be  dangerous for them to remain to bury the dead  as the noise of their  rifles might have attracted the attention of some other body of the  enemy that might possibly be somewhere in the vicinity of the ravine   determined to retrace his steps at once  his two wounded companions   like his prisoner  were able to walk slowly towards the camp  so   collecting the enemy s dead into one place  and covering them with  branches of evergreens  they took up the body of their fallen comrade  and  placing it on a litter hastily formed of boughs gathered on the  spot  slowly wended their way with it towards the point occupied by  the main body of the army  barry and his prisoner moving in the same  direction  some distance in the rear           chapter xiii       in the morning that greaves visited the fort in canada  garrisoned by  barry s regiment  it will be remembered that he had a brief interview  with the colonel  momentary as it was  however  it was sufficient to  prevent barry from getting his discharge  for the colonel was then and  there apprised that our hero sought to leave the army for the purpose  only of joining the anticipated fenian invasion  giving it the  advantage of his military skill  and aiding it with his knowledge of the  fortifications that the invaders might attempt to posses themselves of   on being persuaded  through a glance at a certain document placed in  his hands  that greaves was to be trusted  he at once decided as to the  course that he himself ought to pursue  and the reader has already seen  the result  strange as it may appear for the present  it was greaves   object to induce barry to desert  and thereby shut himself out from ever  revisiting the british dominions again  he felt that it would be better   too  that he should not be taken while in the act of deserting  as his  punishment could be but light  owing to the circumstance  that he had  endeavored  though in vain  to obtain his discharge honorably  so he  determined to aid his escape from the fort  and secure his outlawry  beyond any possibility of mistake  why he was prompted to an act so  gratuitous and so apparently undeserved  remains for future explanation   but  at present  all we have to do with is the simple fact  that owing  to his mysterious machinations  our young hero was driven to the step he  had taken     it is  we perceive  a fact  that o brien was correct in his first  estimate of greaves  as that smooth tongued traitor was the notorious  spy in the pay of the english government  sent out to canada with a view  to learning the particulars of the power and intentions of fenianism in  the provinces  as well as in the adjoining republic  in this connection   he had such papers in his possession as recommended him to the canadian  minister who gave him  on his arrival in the city where we first  encountered him  such assistance and direction as his maudlin state of  mind could afford  he recommended him to the confidence of many persons  in the upper part of the province  where he had been staying for some  time previous to his appearance at the harp  among these was the hon  j   r       of toronto  a patrick s day son of the sod  who has often nailed  ireland to the cross for place and power  and who regards every body  as his  dear friend  who can help him up the ladder  a man with no more  human flesh about his bones or heart within him  than is possessed by  the veriest skeleton that has ever served the purposes of a college of  surgeons  after having reposed for a whole generation in the silence of  the grave  oh  how we long for the day when we shall meet such miserable  judases face to face  and spit upon them before the nations  and how  willing we are to admit that we should rather tomorrow shake the manly  hand of the english joe sheard of toronto  open enemy and all as he is   than touch the vile  clammy paw of such repulsive creatures as compose  the snake like breed of which this same paltry and sordid trimmer is a  true representative  of course  greaves and he understood each other at  once  they were both traitors alike  only that the former was lavish of  money in attaining his nefarious ends  while the latter would crawl to  whatever goal he had in view  through any description of filth provided  it would obviate the necessity of relaxing his gripe upon his ill gotten  gain  it is to such men as he  that ireland owes all her misfortunes   and that the people of canada owe the curse of the great embarrassments  that now sorely beset them  for so far  not a single irishman who has  ever been prominently identified with the government of canada  if  we are at all able to judge  has possessed a spark of honest or true  patriotism  from first to last  every man jack of them has fleeced the  poor canucks unmercifully  and played the toady to england in the most  fulsome and sickening manner  even the best of them were rotten to the  core  and but mere adventurers  look at the case of the  hyena   as he  was called in his prime  one day we find him out at the elbows peddling  samples of wine around the province  and the next  wallowing in wealth  through his point levi and other gouges at the expense of the people   until  at last  he became sufficiently corrupt for england to send him  to take charge of her interests in one of her dependencies  where  as  it is asserted  he  from time to time  is carried from boating parties   etc   to his palatial residence dead drunk  in open daylight  but  why spend a single breath in referring to such miserable specimens of  humanity  the world knows what they are  and canada ought to have some  slight acquaintance with them  as they built her into the worthless  grand trunk at a ruinous figure  and  like her present  leading   political juggler  sir john a   fleeced her in every direction that a  collop could be cut out of her     it was amongst such tricksters  english  irish and scotch  that greaves   for the most part  moved secretly from the moment of his arrival in the  province up to the date at which we find him at port colborne  he was   however  surprised to learn that men so high in power  and that had been  so high in power  really knew so little of the great impending movement  which overshadowed the provinces and bid fair to wrest them from the  hands of england  but few papers in upper canada appeared to know  anything of what was really going on in this relation  besides the   globe   of toronto  nearly all the others  like the leader of the  government and his satellites  seemed to be at sea upon the subject   this fact greaves took care to mention in the dispatches which he sent  home to ireland  from time to time  giving it as his opinion  that the  prime minister of canada was a dangerous man to entrust with any large  interests  civil or military     how the spy had become possessed of the letter or paper which so  staggered o brien  is easily accounted for  one of the organization in  ireland  named greaves  who had been purchased by the government while  on a mission of trust  and who had sworn his way into the brotherhood  with a view to making merchandise of it  gave up his credentials for a  certain sum  and thus it was that they had fallen into the hands of  the castle of dublin and subsequently into those of the spy  cunning as  o brien was  the spy read his connection with the organization through  exhibiting this document to him on the morning succeeding the night of  our first introduction to the harp  for he perceived  at once  that were  o brien not  is some way  identified with the brotherhood  he would have  been unable to recognize the meaning of certain expressions contained in  the paper  which  as already observed  seemed to impress him so suddenly  and so forcibly     now  however  that the provinces were actually invaded  greaves  as we  shall yet continue to call him  found that his mission had suddenly been  brought to a close  as the cat was out of the bag  however  he instantly  turned his undivided attention to some private matters of his own  and  which  after all  was the only thing that induced him to move so rapidly  west  after the escape of barry and his comrades from the fort  but with  all his deeply laid schemes  he began to feel a strange presentiment  that he had overreached himself  and that  notwithstanding the  supposition that he had shut out our hero from canada for all time to  come  it was more than likely he was in the province again  and that   too  as an invader  and but a very short distance from the village in  which he now found himself  this surmise maddened him  for reasons to be  disclosed in due course  and  as if urged by some unseen power  he  was determined to make his way towards the camp of the invaders  well  knowing that had barry joined it  he would vouch for his friendliness   while  had he not re entered the province  he himself could make his way  among the brotherhood as a friend  by the same means that he had stepped  into the good graces  or rather escaped the detection  of o brien     early on the morning of the second of june  then  he set out from port  colborne  with a force under the command of lieut  col  booker  anxious  to witness  and if necessary  take part in the first encounter between  the invaders and the provincial troops  how did he know  perhaps a  chance bullet fired by himself might find its billet in the heart of  barry  had the latter joined the fenians  and if it did  then all would  be right  and his triumph secured  still he had his misgivings as to  the success of the canadians  notwithstanding their reputed superior  numbers  and the presence of the regulars to strengthen and inspirit the  volunteers  he saw that all was uncertainty and confusion  col  peacock   of the   th regulars  chief in command of the united forces  was at   sixes and sevens  with the commanding officer of the volunteers  while  general napier  commanding the regular troops in the whole of upper  canada  was so perplexed with rumors of invasion at various points  as  to be absolutely lost in a maze of bewilderment  and utterly incapable  of meeting the crisis in a soldierly and intelligent manner     thus the confusion ran amongst the canadians  when col  booker  on the  morning just alluded to  set out with his command from port colborne   to attack the irish republican forces  encamped at newbiggin s farm  and  with the further intention of forming a junction with the regulars under  col  peacock  coming from chippewa  the invaders being absolutely hemmed  in on all sides  as a steamer with a field battery occupied the river in  their rear  with a view to cutting off their retreat  when they were  as  it was expected they should be  defeated by the large number of forces  that were being steadily brought down upon them     arriving at the village of ridgeway  the troops left the cars and  proceeded cautiously in the direction of stevensville  at or near which  point they hoped to form the junction with col  peacock  who was on his  way from chippewa  where he had bivouacked the night before  the village  of ridgeway is on the line of the grand trunk railway  which connects  it with port colborne on lake erie on the one side  and fort erie on  the same lake  at the mouth of the niagara river  on the other  it is  situated about eleven miles from the former place  and something like  eight from the latter  leaving the extreme points distant from each  other about nineteen miles  at this little place  then  lieut  col   booker found himself  in command of a force which has been variously  estimated at from twelve to eighteen hundred men  composed of the crack  volunteers of the country  and  as a general thing  commanded by brave  and experienced officers  it has  however  been asserted by some that  there were not more than one thousand british engaged at ridgeway  but  we fear that this is under the mark  and are inclined to believe  that   at an honest computation  their force amounted to between thirteen  and fourteen hundred  this we give on what we consider to be reliable  authority  and can  at once  presume that the division under col  booker  stood something more than three to one against the invaders  as the  handful under the gallant o neill did not exceed four hundred on the  actual field of ridgeway     stevensville lies in the direction of chippewa  on a wagon road  branching off at right angles from the grand trunk at ridgeway village   and here it was that col  peacock ordered col  booker to meet him  with  the men under his command  with the design of forming a junction and  attacking o neill with a combined force of volunteers and regulars  amounting to between two and three thousand men  this junction o neill  was determined to defeat  and did defeat it   but let us not anticipate     when greaves stepped from the cars at ridgeway  the first man he  encountered was the kid  and  strange as it may appear  a sign of  recognition passed between them instantaneously  in a few moments they  managed to extricate themselves from the crowds that thronged the place   and move off to an unfrequented spot  where they could converse unheard  and unobserved  here they were soon engaged on a subject which seemed  to excite greaves to the highest pitch  and elicit from him sundry  ejaculations of surprise mixed with anger  becoming cooler  however  he  led his companion into a spot even more sequestered  and then fell into  a low and earnest conversation with him  in which the name of barry  might be heard pronounced with a deadly  hissing vehemence  indicative  of the most frightful passion and hate  all this time the kid remained  quite calm  answering the interrogatories of his employer  for such  greaves appeared to be  until  at last  the plot or contract  whatever  it was  was completed  and the parties had again bent their steps to the  railway station by different paths     had the gallant o neill two thousand men at his command on the morning  of the  d of june        with the certainty of reinforcements   canada  would  ere this  have been part and parcel of the united states  and  ireland an independent republic   modeled after that of the american  union  no officer was better calculated to accomplish the overthrow  of british power in the dominion  than he  a thorough and practiced  soldier  a man of great personal courage and daring  and above all   a genuine celt  fired with the hereditary hatred of england so  characteristic of his name and race  he was in himself a host  with two  thousand men  composed of such stuff as he commanded at ridgeway  he  could have swept the road before him to toronto  for there can be no  doubt that his numbers would have been largely augmented on the way by  irish nationalists and american sympathisers  who then  as now  pine for  annexation  in addition  when it became once known  that a victorious  army of the republic of ireland was marching on toronto  a demonstration  favorable to the invaders would have been made in that city  or  such indications of friendship evinced by the irish portion of the  inhabitants  as would paralyze the energies of all those within its  borders who were determined to stand by the flag of the tyrant  this  we  are certain  would have been the real result of a march upon that city   for  all that thousands upon thousands of the people of canada  who are  now muzzled by the government  require at any moment to range them on  the side of ireland  is the assurance of success on the part of any  invader  whether irish or american  who makes a descent upon their  shores  what a dreadful calamity  then  it was  that the war department  of the irish republic had fallen into such careless or incompetent  hands  and that some man was not at its head who could have managed  to have thrown upon canadian soil  at fort erie and one or two other  points  a force to act separately or in conjunction with sufficient  effect to completely paralyse all opposition in western canada  among an  already excited and incongruous host  who could have been easily swept  before a compact handful of troops fired by a spirit so lofty and a  resolve so unconquerable as that which actuated the brave little band of  patriots who have made the  d day of june        famous in the annals of  the irish race on this continent and on the other side of the atlantic     let it be thoroughly understood  that although the fortress of quebec  is considered the gibraltar of this continent  it is in the midst of  an irish and french population absolutely hostile to british rule  the  french  like the children of ireland  never were and never can be loyal  to england  and there are but few men in lower canada to day  who would  not rather see the american flag floating over cape diamond at the  present moment  than the blood stained standard which proclaims it in  the grasp of a tyrant  from this we infer  that had toronto  kingston  and montreal fallen into the hands of the invaders  quebec could not  fail to soon follow  and then for the fitting out of irish republican  privateers that would requite all the depredations of the alabama  ten fold  and cripple the commerce of england  as she had destroyed that  of the united states during the last war  general o neill had all this  in his eye  and was ready to push the case to the mouth of the st   lawrence  and there commence active operations against the merchant  service of the common enemy of both ireland and america  sweeping it  from the high seas  and striking the tyrant in her counting house  as  one of her most vulnerable points  there could have been no difficulty  in managing all this  had a sufficient force been thrown into the  province at the time already mentioned  nor can it be attended with much  difficulty at any moment  provided the right men are placed at the head  of the fenian war department  canada is doomed  whomsoever her conqueror  may be  so the sooner her people experience the change which is sure  to overtake her  the sooner shall she be restored to internal peace   prosperity and security  from all of which she is now excluded  and  must remain so  as long as she continues part and parcel of the british  empire     as by this time  the invading army had been in the province for a  portion of two days and two nights  the country generally was pretty  well excited  but particularly in and about the section where the  invaders had taken up their position  as well as along the line of col   peacock s march  still there did not appear any very marked disposition  on the part of the actual settlers in these quarters to take a decided  part in stemming the invasion  it appears to us  that it was simply the  government that moved through agencies  in this connection  which  could not well disregard or resist their commands  rather than any  antagonistic  out spoken sentiment of the people  that had developed  itself into active hostility against the fenian forces  be this as it  may  the numbers hastily brought against the invaders were large in  comparison with their own rank and file  and had they been actuated by a  spirit similar to that which made a host of each individual fenian  the  fortunes of the day could not have failed to have been otherwise than  they subsequently turned out to be  again  let it be understood  that  the majority of the little band who withstood the tempest shock at  ridgeway  were fresh from the fields of the south and used to the song  of the bullet and the roar of artillery  as the great bulk of the army  of the irish republic in america is to day  while even the british  regulars who were marching on ridgeway were  with all their pretensions   but feather bed soldiers who were totally out of practice of the real  field  and had for many a day exhibited their pluck and discipline at  general reviews or sham battles only  this we hold to weigh heavily on  the side of the irish national forces  and to decide in their favor  in  advance  in any fight with treble their number of such an enemy  that  is  we are of the fixed impression  that any hundred picked men from the  force now under the gallant o neill  will beat  in open fight  any  three hundred of the british army brought against them  all things being  equal  with the exception of numbers  and why   simply because in  one case the belligerents would be fighting for the traditions and  independence of the land of their love  while in the other they would   as a general  thing  be fighting for about six pence a day     as soon as colonel booker and his command took the road towards  stevensville  greaves  who was as daring as a man could be  and who  was besides well acquainted with military tactics  procured a rifle  a  soldiers jacket  cap and accoutrements  and started forth in the wake  of the volunteers  with the rear guard of which he soon came up  the  accoutrements he wore belonged to one of the volunteers who  like many  of the men under colonel peacock  took suddenly ill as they approached  the fenian lines  and fell out of the ranks  fortunately for the spy  he  found in this guard the very comrade of the man who was left behind at  the village  and having received permission from the officer in charge   fell into the ranks with him and held on his way  as though he were an  ordinary member of the force     on the other hand  the kid  on parting with greaves  took his way in  the direction in which he knew the invaders were slowly and cautiously  moving  in order to get between booker and peacock  and defeat one  command before it could form a juncture with the other  on approaching  their lines  the steady tramp of which he could hear  he fell rapidly in  the rear  where  true to their instincts  he found black jack and wilson  following in the team of the latter at a respectable distance  and  anxiously waiting for the first volley that should give intimation that  an engagement had commenced      by        exclaimed wilson  as his acquaintance jumped into the wagon    this is coming to rather close quarters       if so be   replied jack   as there vos henny har tillery in the vay  it  might urt the missuses jam pots  seein as  ow we can t be much hover a  mile from them  from this  ere place       scarcely that   returned the kid   and what s more  from the course  the fenians are taking  they must soon be into it against three or four  times their number  and serve them right  but what luck have you had  during the night   he continued  turning to jack   although i suspect  there was not much chance in the direction in which you spent it       call this a hinvasion   retorted jack   vy these coves  av only a  come hover to show their good breedin and spend their money amongst the  canadians  instead of doin the decent thing like as ow it vos done in  hindia and the peninsoola  veh the real harmy cut  burned and plundered  hall afore  em   and carried hoff  from old and young  bags of the most  precious svag  this is disgustin  honly fancy the fellows a behavin as  if they vos on knight herranty of the hancient times  instead of givin  a cove a chance of to do a little business among the walluables of fort  erie  or hany hother place in the wicinity  i tell  ee what  kid  i m  sorry as vee hever comed hover  that i be  and i vish i vos veil back  again behind my hown counter       don t be down hearted   replied the kid   for there will be fun  somewhere soon  when these invaders will have to fall back on fort erie   where there may be a muss  or else the canadians will have to retreat  towards the village i have but recently left  so that in either case  there may yet be a chance to throw something into the bottom of the  wagon  and then in our turn fall back on friend wilson s  here      in this way the conversation was continued  while the horses moved  slowly along the road taken by the invaders  and at such a distance  from the rear of the force  as not to be visible to any of the soldiers   until  just as the three companions we re passing through a patch of  woods about a quarter of a mile from the rear guard of the invaders   they were suddenly startled by the report of firearms in the direction  of the troops  just ahead of them  this report was followed by another   and yet another  and now by one continuous volley  the famous battle of  ridgeway had commenced           chapter xiv       kate mccarthy  after having heard the disclosure of martha  regarding  the character of her uncle  and the dangerous and nefarious practices  in which he and smith  or the kid  were engaged  arrived  by degrees  at  the conclusion  that she was the victim of some horrible and mysterious  plot  in which nicholas  too  was involved unconsciously  this idea  having taken full possession of her  she immediately communicated it to  her friend  who also seemed to share her apprehension  of course  she  had no means of accounting for the existence of the talisman upon which   at the time she received it  she could have staked her life  but  now   it was too plain  that even about this there was something strange and  unsatisfactory  because  from her frequent inspection of it  although  it had evidently come from the hand of nicholas  it appeared to have  not been so clearly intended for her  as she could have desired  yet  for whom else could it have been designed  this was the question  and  it necessarily remained unanswered  while the conviction still obtained   that  notwithstanding there was enough in the mysterious token to  justify the course she had taken  she was nevertheless in most dangerous  toils  with the existence of which her lover was totally unacquainted     this once settled in her mind  her first impulse was to flee the house  immediately  but  on second consideration  she felt it were better to  await results  as she was certain that martha was her true friend  and  believed that no actual violence would be offered to her while  under wilson s roof  were she to effect her escape she had neither  acquaintance nor guide to direct her steps  and was totally uninformed  as to the character and people of the locality in which she found  herself  again  wilson had no doubt  placed eyes upon her that would  arrest her footsteps  or so embarrass her that she should again fall  into the hands from which she sought to escape  the region around her   as she now learned  was addicted to smuggling  and so marked was this  truth  that a house of entertainment in the neighborhood was called the  smuggler s home  where  it was said  bold and reckless men were to be  found constantly  there was one thing  however  she was determined upon   and that was to procure  if possible  some weapon of defence in case any  attempt were made to further jeopardize her person or liberty  and in  this she was promptly aided by her young friend     she had now been nearly a week from home  and yet not an additional word  or line had arrived from her lover  it was fortunate  however  that in  her present perilous condition she had one in whom she could confide   and whom she knew sympathised with her  this was a solace to her  as it  enabled her from time to time  to ease her burdened heart of the heavy  load that pressed upon it  and converse upon the probable designs of  those into whose toils she hod been betrayed  smith  she was well aware   knew all the circumstances of her case  but he was in the employment of  her persecutor or persecutors  and nothing  she was certain  was to be  gleaned from him  however  as he had some design on the hand of martha   the thought struck her that if opportunity served  her young friend  might be able to extract from him even a hint as to the real state of  her case  and this idea she at once communicated to her  martha  on her  part  expressed herself willing to befriend her to the utmost of her  power  but still evinced a repugnance to be under any obligation to  smith  or enter into relations with him that could aim at anything like  confidence between them  yet she confessed herself ready to sacrifice  her feelings as far as she could properly do so  for the purpose of  fathoming the plot that surrounded her companion  but  then  where was  smith to begin with  and when was it probable that he should again  make his appearance in that locality  these were points more easily  entertained than disposed of  and thus matters stood when circumstances  threw in their way the very individual they both desired to see     when the kid  jack and wilson were liberated on the evening of the  day on which they had been captured with others  and sent into the  headquarters of gen  o neill  it was decided that the first named of  these worthies should proceed at once to wilson s  and apprise the  family of the presence of a hostile army  and the necessity of keeping  close and barricading the house in case the tide of war should roll  in that direction  the habitation  as already mentioned  stood in an  isolated spot surrounded with woods  and the proprietor was of the  impression  that it would escape notice or molestation  from the fact  that the fenians seemed to eschew everything that savored  in even  the slightest degree  of the destruction of private property or of  gratuitous pillage  besides  he perceived that for the purpose of  meeting some of the necessities of the invaders  a few horses had been  already impressed into their service  and felt  consequently  that were  his discovered on the road leading to his home  they could not fail to  share the same fate  he therefore  as just intimated  begged the kid to  make the best of his way to limestone ridge  beside which his domicile  stood  to this request the kid willingly acceded  as it would afford him  another opportunity of seeing martha  so  when evening was about to set  in  he commenced his journey     earlier in the day  the brave captain o donohue  of the   th  white out  on a foraging party towards chippewa  came up with some outposts of the  enemy  who  noticing his dauntless bearing  and the steady  onward tramp  of his handful of men  fled at his approach without firing a single  shot     when passing out of the camp to the main road  the kid learned that the  whole force was to move off at about ten o clock in the direction  of chippewa  it being the intention of the commander  as previously  observed  to get between the body of regulars about proceeding from that  point  and that of the volunteers  to move forward  and form a junction  with them  from port colborne  intending to attack and defeat the one  before the other came up  at this time o neill s troops did not  as  is confidently asserted  number as many as five hundred men  while the  force of the enemy surrounding him on every side  was estimated at an  aggregate of some thousands  this he well knew  but he had invaded the  territories of the ancient and implacable antagonist of his country and  his name  and he was determined to make another thermopylae of any pass  in which he happened to meet the foe  no matter how overwhelming their  numbers     this intelligence impressed the kid with the idea that a battle might  possibly take place somewhere in the vicinity of stevensville or  ridgeway  as he knew that the leader of the irish republican army  or  forlorn hope  as so small a body of men might be termed  would attempt  to intercept a junction of the enemy somewhere near one or the other  of these points  as both lay on the line between chippewa and port  colborne  taking the sodom road and the grand trunk railway as the  surest and speediest route between both these latter places  so pushing  forward  with speed that never slackened  just at the period that  o neill was about to break camp  under the pretence of attacking  chippewa  mr  stephen smith arrived at wilson s door  and after a polite  double knock was admitted by the mistress of that suspicious dwelling     martha was soon apprised of his arrival  and while her companion  trembled throughout every limb with anxiety for the fate of the  important enquiries which she had kindly consented to make  she hastily  left the apartment where both had been long seated  conversing upon  their future and the chances of escape from such a den  on perceiving  the kid  although her very soul revolted against the touch of his  cold  clammy hand  she seemed to welcome him with more than ordinary  cordiality  she was  of course  both surprised and alarmed at the  intelligence of the invasion  and the proximity of the two armies  for   as yet  not a whisper of it had reached her  so secluded the place  he  spoke of the necessity of putting the house in a state of defence  so as  to be ready to meet any contingency  although  as he himself averred  he  did not apprehend the slightest danger so long as the inmates remained  within their doors  in case the din of battle was heard in the vicinity   as it was  however  the windows were well secured  and the heavy  oaken  front door was capable of being rendered all but invulnerable by a huge  iron bar that could be speedily thrown across it into two deep grooves  in the posts     all this having been seen to  some trifling inquiry was made as to their  lodger  when mrs  wilson  understanding previously the intention of  martha  and sympathizing with the case of poor kate  left the apartment   as if on some ordinary household affair  martha now set about gaining  the information she sought  but with all her art  could only ascertain  from her suitor  that kate was in the power of an individual who  for  some reason unknown to him  had betrayed her into canada  and consigned  her  for a time at least  to the place where she was now domiciled      and were you a party to the abduction of this innocent creature    exclaimed martha  the blood mounting to her cheeks in real anger and  disgust      oh  it was all in the way of business   replied the other   and  perceiving that it would result in the most pleasant companionship for  one i so admire  i had the less scruples in furthering the design of a  good employer      let it be understood that this villain had not even the most remote idea  of the pure nature and true character of martha  having seen her but a  few times  he subjected her moral worth to the standard of that of her  uncle  and thought  consequently  that the disclosure he now made would  enhance him in her estimation  in this he was mistaken  for  no sooner  had he made her thoroughly cognizant of the fact that he was not an  innocent  but a willing  instrument in the abduction of poor kate  than  she sprang to her feet  and with a glance the most withering  and full  of unconquerable hate and aversion  without a single other word  left  the apartment and ascended to that of her friend     no sooner had she disappeared than an expression the most demoniacal  stole over the countenance of smith  the very devil sat on his brow   while his eyes turned absolutely green in their sockets  his thin  pale  lips glistened again  as he drew them across his sharp  white teeth   in an attempt to smile  looking stealthily about him  while a curious  expression  still more horrible  replaced the one already described  he  hastily drew a long knife from a sheath concealed beneath his vest  and  regarded it for a moment in the light of the lamp before him  he knew  that every hope of obtaining the hand of martha was lost  and forever   and now for a terrible revenge      they are helpless and alone   he muttered  slowly rising to his feet    there is wealth  too  somewhere here  and should i silence them all  it  will be mine  and their death will be laid at the door of the invaders   besides   he growled   no suspicion can rest upon me  as i am the known  friend of wilson and the family  nobody saw me come  no person shall  see me leave  i shall fire the house after having rifled it  and conceal  whatever i may obtain  in some convenient spot until the affair has  blown over  jack and wilson know too much of me  i am tired of them  if  needs be  i shall silence them also  i have rare work before me  barry  must die  but what shall i profit by killing him if i kill this woman  also  who cares  the devil is working with me  and now for it  to the  foot of the stairs  then  where  as they descend  they shall fall one by  one without a groan until the rare bird of a prisoner is left alone in  her room  then for some wild sport and the final blow      having muttered all this to himself  the demon in human shape   extinguishing the lamp  sprang forward in the direction of the stairs   to await the first who happened to descend  but scarcely had he assumed  his post of death  before the large oaken door was thrust rudely open  and two strapping young fellows  armed with a revolver and a dirk  each  rushed into the apartment  and alarmed all the party up stairs by  calling aloud for a light  the gleam from the hearth being feeble and  uncertain     instantly the knife of smith was returned to its sheath  while he  stepped forward  saying that he had just accidently extinguished the  lamp in the absence of mrs  wilson and martha  who had run up stairs to  acquaint a lady friend with the intelligence that he had but that moment  brought her from mr  wilson  regarding the invasion of the province and  the proximity  as he had no doubt  of the fenian and canadian forces      that is just the mission we have come on ourselves   returned one of  the new comers   as we were apprised that mr  wilson was from home  and  thought that his family would like to know of the dangers that possibly  surrounded them      the manly voice of the speaker soon brought martha and her aunt down  stairs  and the lamp being speedily relighted  the former advanced  towards the speaker and taking his extended hand  with a bright eye and  a flushed cheek  heard all he had to say on the subject which occasioned  his unceremonious visit      one of us will stay with you   he continued  while she thanked him for  his goodness   until mr  wilson arrives  and although he is not over  social in his habits  i am sure he will not misconstrue the anxiety we  feel for the safety of his family       thank you  thank you  mr  evans   returned martha   we shall feel so  grateful for your protection  and as to my uncle  i am satisfied he  cannot be otherwise than obliged to you for this great kindness       you stay then  harry   observed the other stranger   for i shall move  on to ridgeway  as i want to hear what s afloat there  there are  troops  i know  at port colborne  and they ought to be apprised of  the whereabouts of the enemy  and so should the inhabitants of this  neighborhood  mr  graham  the collector of fort erie  has  i am  informed  proceeded with information of the enemy to port colborne   but still there is not yet anything known of their precise location  so  contradictory are the rumors  not only as to where they are encamped   but in relation to their numbers       i can satisfy you as to both these circumstances   broke in the kid   with a voice as bland as if murder had not visited his heart for an age    for i heard this evening that they were encamped about four hundred  strong at newbiggin s farm  four or five miles down the river from  fort erie  and that they intended to move on towards chippewa about  ten o clock  branching off in the direction of ridgeway  in the hope of  meeting the troops coming from port colborne  and defeating them before  they formed a junction with those expected from chippewa       as my cousin harry will sit up with the family for the remainder of  the night  then  perhaps you would not mind walking as far as ridgeway    replied the young fellow who had last spoken   as we are sure to have  news there  from the fact of the village being on the line of the grand  trunk      seeing that his murderous plot was for the time defeated  the kid made  no objection to this request  feeling that the darkness and the night   as well as any whirl of excitement or debauch  were more in accordance  with the infernal tone of his spirit  than the conversation of two  beings  martha and evans  whom his keen eye at once discovered to be  lovers  so bidding the family good night  and not waiting to partake of  the refreshments offered him after his journey from the fenian camp   he sallied forth with his new acquaintance on the road leading to the  village      henry   said martha  when the sound of their receding footsteps had  died in the distance   do you know anything of the man smith who has  just left us  for you seemed to eye him very intently from the moment  the lamp was relighted until the door closed behind him this moment   we know now  and have often suspected  him to be a villain  but  circumstances over which we had no control  that is  my aunt and  myself  have thrown us occasionally into the society of the wretch  whom  we both loathe and detest      this interrogatory was put in the absence of mrs  wilson  who had again  sought the apartment of kate to tell her all that had just transpired   it seemed to embarrass the young man for a moment  but recovering  himself  he frankly replied       i have seen that man frequently in buffalo  not long since  he was  pointed out to me as a most dangerous character who was under the  surveillance of the police  and  as you may be well assured  i was  astounded to find him here and at such an hour       oh   returned martha   he has been here often  henry  and what i  now fear is  that my uncle is leagued with him  not only in the most  frightfully dishonest practices  but in the abduction  at the instance  of some other villain  of a good and pure young creature who  a few  nights ago  was brought here by them under the pretense that it was  the wish of her lover that she should accompany them where this wretch  would  a pretense that disguised itself under a veritable token procured  in some way from her betrothed  and evidently used without his sanction  or knowledge       i believe your uncle to be a bad man  martha   returned evans   but the  fault is not yours  and besides  there is not a single drop of his blood  in your veins  i am convinced  also  that your aunt knows it  and that  it is that which so wastes her away and destroys the whole sunshine of  her life  i have long felt it  and were it not for the dread of paining  you through exposure  i should ere this have directed the attention  of the authorities to some circumstances affecting his character and  honesty  that came under my own notice  for  martha  dear  but a few  hours since  as i may say  i was an accidental witness of an incident  which more than confirms all the suspicions that have so long rested on  him       i know  i know   interrupted martha  while she hid her face in her  hands and wept in bitter agony   but go on       when   resumed evans   two or three nights ago  believing wilson to  be from home  for i shall no longer call him your uncle  he being  in  truth  no relation whatever of yours   i stole up from our place to say  a few words to you and urge you to quit this house and become my wife   i was astonished to see a light in the stable as i crept by it  and  looking into one of the windows  i perceived this man leaning over a  large case filled with valuables that had evidently been stolen by  him  or by some of his accomplices  who had entrusted them to his safe  keeping until the noise of the robbery had blown over  i saw this  i  saw with my own eyes  and now that you are aware of it  can you longer  remain beneath this roof       it is true  alas  too true   sobbed martha   for i myself saw the very  same case  and then it was  that for the first time  a full sense of  his horrible vocation fell upon me and the poor woman that he calls his  wife  of course  henry  i shall quit this place  and forever  but until  this horrible din is over  and the poor creature up stairs placed in  some safe hands  i shall bear my terrible lot as best i can       rightly spoken  dear martha   returned henry  kissing off her tears    and i trust that this lady of whom you speak  will prove herself worthy  your kindness and esteem       no fear of that  dear henry   returned the maiden   my heart tells me  that she is as good as she is beautiful  and i know  not only from her  own lips  but from what has transpired this very night  that she is the  victim of some foul plot yet to be punished and explained       and where has she come from  and what is her name   rejoined henry   evidently becoming interested in the fate of our heroine      her home is in buffalo   replied martha   and her name is kate  m carthy       by heaven   exclaimed evans  leaping to his feet as if the house were  falling   where is she  where is she  lead me to her at once            chapter xv       had general o neill not entertained strong hopes he should be  re inforced  knowing  as he did  that a large body of fenian troops were  scattered along the american frontier  under the command of brave and  true men  he would have broken camp with a sad heart on the night of  the first  no man in existence was more thoroughly aware than he  that    though brave as lions  the force at his command was altogether too  small to effect anything permanent upon the soil of the enemy  the  most he hoped to achieve  was a footing  until his command had acquired  sufficient strength to enable him to move upon some of the important  towns of the upper province  of the dangers and perils that surrounded  him he was fully aware  but he knew  also  that  now that he had crossed  the rubicon  how fatal it would be to the prestige of the cause of  ireland  to retreat again to the american shore without measuring  swords with the foe  no matter what their numbers  and  if needs be   illustrating  with a handful of men  the spirit resolve and bravery  which  long previously  fostered by the noble roberts and gibbons  etc    fired the whole organization on this great continent  and placed the  ultimate independence of ireland beyond any possible contingency   o neill was just the man to make this impression  and to seize upon  every circumstance calculated to aid him in the attempt  fresh from the  fields of the south  where his sword and name were a watchword and a  tower of strength when danger was to be met in the gap  he was used to  war in all its phases  while the fierce leaven of his patriotism and the  mighty promptings of his ancient name  now that he had made a descent  upon the enemy of his country and his race  rendered him almost  invincible  though small his band  he knew that each man who had  accompanied him thus far was a host in himself  and ennobled by a spirit  identical with that which prompted him in the main  and now the hour had  arrived when he should show the enemy and the world that numbers were  as nothing in the sight of the god of battles  besides  he felt it  as a  mere matter of generalship  incumbent upon him to maintain  if possible   a foothold or rallying point for whatever reinforcements might follow  him  as well as keep open the line of communication with the shores he  had but just left  in short  critically as he was placed  and regarding  his little host as the vanguard of freedom  he determined to sacrifice  himself and them to a man  if necessary  in maintaining his ground until  thoroughly satisfied of the truth of his fears that president roberts   deceived  like the organization generally  in the capacity of the  secretary of war  was no longer able to send reinforcements or further  a movement calculated to sweep the province from sandwich to quebec  in  this way matters stood with him on the night that he left his camp at  newbiggin s farm  he was aware that two large bodies of the enemy s  troops were marching upon him from two opposite points  and that to  permit them to form a junction would be to court utter annihilation  as  before observed  then  he set out at the hour already named  with a view  to getting between them and defeating the one before the other came up   in his sublime enthusiasm he invested each individual of his command  with the purposes and attributes of a hero  and felt that a body so  constituted  so compact and so easily handled  could be slung with  fearful effect against almost any number of men who had no heart in the  fight  save that which was engendered by an uneasy and uncomfortable  sentiment of badly founded loyalty to the flag of a tyrant  or that  degrading spirit of hireling hostility  which changed its force  and direction  in accordance with the amount of gold offered by the  subsidizing party     moved by impulses so noble and disinterested  the whole camp now marched  away in the direction of chippewa  burning the bridges behind them  to  a point some five or six miles distant  where the reconnoitering party   under the command of col  hoy  had been ordered to wait until the main  body of the troops came up  and to the left of which gen  o neill hoped  to intercept some one of the two hostile forces that were  as he was  perfectly convinced  moving against him from opposite points of the  compass     in the rear of the moving camp followed black jack and wilson  at a very  respectful distance  they being comfortably seated in the wagon of the  latter  that had been brought cautiously from its hiding place  when the  steady tramp of the rear guard of the army had died away      what a pity it is   said wilson  as the team crawled slowly along    that we have no chance to take the number of a few of those self same  invaders from behind a tree or log  for i find the english blood  beginning to stir within me       vot s to be gained by it   returned black jack   seein as  ow there s  no use in cuttin a vizzen or scuttlin a nob  unless there s some svag  at the end on it  for my own part   he continued   i d rather that ve  should try our luck among some of the farmers or gentry about here   although i m certain they re purty vide avake seem as vot s afoot just  now       yes  yes   returned the other   that s all well enough in its way  but  as we can t hope to accomplish much until there s a fight between the  invaders and the invaded  i should like  if an opportunity turned up   to thin out a few of those green jackets while we hid the horses hard by  and waited the result of the conflict       vell  vell   replied jack   there vouldn t be much  arm in tryin our   and in that vay  as ven ve got a chance ve might step into the ranks of  the hinglish and give them a lift  ven  if needs be  ve could slip out  again and take our luck in the trail of the fight  pickin hup votever  might drop in the vay      about midnight the troops came up with col  hoy s party  and after  marching a considerable distance and then taking a couple of hours rest   the whole force made a cautious detour towards the direct line leading  from ridgeway to chippewa  o neill being satisfied that he had already  intercepted the junction of the british  and should be able to engage  and defeat either one party or the other before they could both unite     in this way the night was passed  every precaution being taken to guard  against ambush or surprise  until morning became well advanced  and  the invaders  after having emerged from a swamp through which they had  marched  found themselves within three or four miles of ridgeway     it was at this point and period that the kid  after leaving greaves   had come up with  or rather encountered  the wagon with black jack and  wilson  who  as usual  kept moving slowly in the rear of the troops and  sniffing  like blood hounds or vultures  their prey in the distance     as observed in a previous chapter  the two worthies had scarcely  welcomed their companion or seen him comfortably seated beside them   before they were all aroused by the report of fire arms  apparently  ahead of the main body of the troops  which  as near as they could  calculate  was about half a mile in advance  it was at this moment that  the brave col  starr  who commanded the advance  got the first glimpse  of the outposts of the enemy  which he at once charged and drove in  like so many sheep  and this was the music heard by wilson and his  companions  shortly afterwards  the main body of the enemy  commanded by  lieut  col  booker  from port colborne  were discovered  and the battle  was opened by a speedy and judicious disposition of the fenian forces   and the hasty throwing up of a rail barricade from behind which some of  the boys in green commenced their work of destruction  while others of  them kept the british skirmishers in hand in the woods hard by  and in a  manner the most cool and artistic     any person who gets a view of major dennison s map  in the work already  mentioned  representing the disposition of the two antagonistic forces  at ridgeway  will at once be struck with the overwhelming numbers of  that under the command of col  booker  compared with the compactness  and fewness of the troops commanded by general o neill  in this chart  we have the whole field studded  on the british side  with highlanders   york rifles  trinity college companies  university rifles  the queen s  own and the   th field battery  etc   while on the side of the army of  the irish republic  as the diagram shows  we have but a handful of  men  without artillery  and with but very few mounted officers  the  circumstances under which the forces met  were favorable to col  booker   also  for not only had the british the advantage of a great superiority  in numbers  stores and equipments  but they were engaged at their own  doors  in the midst of a passive or friendly element  and with unlimited  supplies and resources at their command  while  on the contrary  the  men under general o neill were but poorly equipped  without supplies or  proper ammunition  their bullets having  in some instances  to be  pared on the field with a knife before they fitted the bore of their  rifles  and were in the midst of an enemy s country  surrounded on  all sides by hostile battalions  and with but a slight hope of being  reinforced before the enemy came down in overwhelming numbers upon them   this was a critical position  and well calculated to dismay any man less  bold and courageous than o neill  but frightful as it was  he saw the  necessity of accepting the situation  he remembered having  on the  battle fields of the south  with but twenty men  defeated two hundred of  a force under hamilton  and run them in helpless disorder for a  distance of thirteen miles  killing five of them with his own hand  he  remembered  in addition  having  with a command of but fifty  charged   on the same fields  in defence of the american union  two different  regiments of the enemy  routed them  and recaptured the officers  and guns of the republic that had been previously taken by them  and  remembering all this  his heart rose within him  and he felt that with  his little band of spartans  few as they were in number  he could work  a double miracle when he met the tyrant of his name  his country and his  race face to face  and so he did not stoop to measure the forces that  were surrounding him  well knowing that  if all came to all  and that   if it were necessary for him to fall back upon the american shore   he could cut his way through them  as he was inclined to regard their  numbers as but simple encumbrances to themselves  feeling  as he  did  that they could be neither disciplined nor actuated by any proud  impulses such as fired his own troops and his own bosom     buoyed with this spirit  and moved by the conviction that the eyes of  the world were upon him  the first glimpse of the enemy was as one of  sunshine to him  and as he looked around him and saw his brave officers  and men towering and immoveable as cliffs in the presence of the angry  deep  the strange fire so noticeable sometimes in his eye  blazed forth  as though his soul went out in flame through each glaring orb  and the  work of death had begun     the battle of ridgeway was commenced by skirmishers who were posted  on both sides  among the woods and orchards with which that locality  abounds  and although for some short period but little life was lost on  the part of either the british or the fenians  the daring of the latter  had evidently confused and  in a degree  paralyzed the former from the  first  in the woods  they gave the highlanders a dreadful overhauling   and when pressed by numbers they steadily fell back upon the main body   with advantage to themselves and with loss to their opponents  when  once aware of their position  and the great odds against them  in the  incredible space of ten minutes  they threw up a breastwork of rails   from behind which they now began to deal the most deadly havoc amongst  the enemy  the men engaged in more exposed positions  performed absolute  miracles of valor  and charged the foe in the face of the most galling  fire  until they actually touched their bayonets  and then poured in the  murderous volley that shattered their ranks and strewed the field with  their wounded and dying  as we learn from major denison  of the british  forces  the fenian officers were ever in front of their men  cheering  them on to death or victory  and evincing such instances of true bravery  as commanded the admiration of even those against whom they fought   individual acts of the most terrible daring were performed by them   and so generally did the whole of o neil s staff  including his gallant  aid de camp  lieut  rudolph fitzpatrick  as well as all the officers of  the various companies  participate in the dreadful struggle  that  even to this hour no writer has attempted to give any one of them  pre eminence over the other  and so of the rank and file  also  scarce  a single man of them  at one period  but was spattered with the blood  of the enemy  and never did a solitary knot of them give way  for an  instant  before any force that they were ordered to withstand  wherever  they moved the dead and wounded tumbled before them  until  fatigued  by the frightful heat of the weather  they were  from time to time   constrained to pause in their dreadful work     the engagement had continued for about an hour  when the brave lieut   lonergan bit the dust  while a cheer for ireland struggled through the  death rattle in his throat  he fell  a true hero and patriot  and well  was his death avenged  for no sooner had its intelligence spread through  his company  than its members became absolute tigers  and literally  glutted themselves with blood  then it was  that the sun burst carried  through that hot field  from beginning to end  by sergeant john smith   of the  th i r a   company g  might be seen flying where the enemy was  thickest  surrounded by a struggling band  each of which was a host  himself  then it was  that the wild cry of  erin go bragh   smote on  the ear of the foe like a death knell  paralyzed all their energies   and froze the warm current in their heart  at that moment a dozen men in  green were worth a regiment of the material he fought against  and thus  it was  that the enemy determined to mass all their forces against  the gallant o neill  who stood like a rock amid the dreadful conflict   giving his orders with as much coolness as if he were dictating a  letter  and  while the bullets whistled about him like hail  applauding  the noble deeds of his men and officers  the next moment to be whirled  into the dreadful  melee  himself     with the keen  quick eye of a soldier  o neill perceived the intention  of his adversary  who had  now  as he saw clearly  made up his mind to  mass all his force against the fenian troops and flank them  at this  point the boys in green were ordered to fall steadily back and take up  a new position  some distance in the rear of their rail barricade  the  movement was performed in the most masterly manner  while the enemy  continued to extend his wings  both right and left  on perceiving it   however  he construed it  as it was intended he should  into a retreat   and paused for a moment to consider what was best to be done  while  deliberating  however  o neill  who had in vain been for some time  endeavoring to draw out his centre  perceiving that the moment had  arrived  sounded the charge  and  the next instant  the whole compact  body of the invaders  with himself and his officers at their head   were thundering down  with the sweep of the cyclone  upon the weak and  startled centre of the foe  crashing through it like a cavalcade of  thunder bolts  and scattering the whole of the english forces like chaff  before the wind     in the twinkling of an eye the enemy was flying in every direction  before the victorious army of the irish republic  in their ignoble  flight they divested themselves of all the clothing they could decently  spare  and of everything that could tend to impede their progress  the  field was strown with their great coats  knapsacks  rifles  and musical  instruments belonging to their bands  their dead and dying were left  unheeded  and in every direction lay the unmistakable evidences of  their sudden disaster and hopeless defeat  the compactness and dreadful  resolve of the force slung against them by o neill  and the masterly  way in which the bolt was hurled  at once bid defiance to all their  pre conceived ideas of fighting  or of the wonders that could be  attained by a handful of brave men  commanded by a dauntless and  experienced soldier  so  that their rumored attempt at rallying is  supposed to have originated in a desire on the part of their historian   to lessen the disgrace of their defeat in the eyes of the people of  canada  for it is well known  that so hot and heavy was the pursuit   that they not only had no time to rally  but so intent was each one of  them on effecting his own personal safety  that all discipline was at an  end  until the fenians  on perceiving that they were not yet reinforced   felt it advisable  notwithstanding their success  to fall back on fort  erie  for the purpose of keeping their line of communication open with  the american shore     and yet until this disaster had overtaken them  the british troops  fought well  considering the incentives they had to stake their lives on  the field of battle  nor were the queen s own  who suffered so severely  in this tremendous charge  and who fled so panic stricken before it   a whit behind  in courage  some of the companies who appear to have  escaped with less censure from the canadian public  in relation to the  loss of this important field  the queen s own  as we are creditably  informed  came up well to the mark on more than one occasion  and only  gave way before such a charge as that which carried the day at fontenoy   and which was  at the period  absolutely irresistible     barry and his comrades of the canadian fort fought throughout the whole  morning with the most heroic courage  in several hand to hand encounters  he performed prodigies of valor  and once thought he perceived the kid  and black jack  together with wilson whom he saw in their company at  newbiggin s farm  fighting on the english side  in this he was not  mistaken  for these three worthies  on discovering the superior force  of the british  at once concealed their horses and wagon in a sheltered  hollow hard by the field  and making a detour through the woods on the  verge of which they were passing  joined in the engagement  against the  men who had treated them so well but a few hours previously  this they  accomplished immediately after col  starr had driven in the outposts  of the enemy  and when they had ascertained that the english forces  outnumbered the invaders to an extent which  as they supposed  rendered  the success of the latter totally out of the question     while on one occasion  nicholas was engaged with a highlander whom  he was pressing hard  a ball grazed his shoulder  evidently fired  stealthily from behind a neighboring tree  a glance in the direction  revealed the form of the kid retreating from the spot and seeking  shelter behind another  around which were gathered a few of the enemy  who were paying some attention to a wounded officer  this struck him  as strange  but as he had other work in hand  he permitted his cowardly  assailant to escape for the moment  later in the day  however  he caught  yet another sight of him  and was satisfied that he had made a second  deadly attempt upon his life  in this way the matter stood touching  this peculiar case  until the total rout of the forces and their retreat  towards ridgeway village  when barry  left with a few men to look after  the dead and wounded while the main body pursued the fugitives  had yet  another opportunity of testing the kindly intentions of smith  for while  he and four or five others were collecting the dead into one particular  spot beneath a huge elm  in the vicinity of a house near which the  greatest carnage had taken place  another ball whizzed by his ear  and  the next moment the door of the building opened and out rushed half a  dozen men  armed to the teeth  and laying one of his party dead at his  feet with the only bullet that had taken effect out of a volley that  had been fired as they rushed forward to overwhelm him in a hand to hand  struggle     the assailants were now six to five  but barry soon made the numbers  more equal  and the fight becoming desperate  two of his antagonists  closed with him  who appeared to be men of tremendous activity and great  personal courage  what seemed strangest  however  in the whole of  this sudden attack  was  all the party that rushed from the house were  masked  although he was satisfied that one of them  at least  was the  kid  the contest had continued for about eight or ten minutes when one  of his assailants was stretched at his feet by an unseen hand  the other  taking immediate flight  he looked around   a stranger stood by his  side  he was a handsome young man dressed in the plain garb of a farmer   anxious to learn how the rest of his comrades fared  while thanking his  new ally for his timely assistance  he glanced in the direction in which  they fought  all save one was wounded but their antagonists lay beside  them dead or dying  begging the stranger to render him some assistance  in staunching the blood of those who still survived  and removing them  to a shed belonging to the house hard by  he discovered that his fallen  adversary  who lay quite senseless from the blow he had received  now  seemed to be bleeding profusely from some wound inflicted by himself   although until that moment he had not noticed it  his enemy had fought  with a long  keen dagger after he had discharged his rifle and thrown it  away  while the fugitive used one of the ordinary rifle bayonets in his  attack  the superb swordsmanship of their intended victim  however  was  more than a match for them  and would  in all probability have triumphed  of itself had not the contest been broken in upon in the manner already  described     in the course of a very few moments  the sufferers were removed from out  the broiling sun to the shed just mentioned  where they were cared for  as well as circumstances would permit  the stranger passing to and from  the adjoining house with the necessary bandages  water  etc     while removing the masks of two of the assailing party  who appeared to  be mortally wounded  for the purpose of giving them the draft of water  they had so earnestly though feebly implored  as barry suspected  one of  them was the kid  the other was wilson  whose last midnight journey had  evidently been performed  as he was sinking fast  and that  too  without  having gratified his love of plunder in a single instance connected with  the invasion from which he and his two companions had anticipated so  much  outside  beneath a huge elm  lay black jack stone dead  from a  frightful bayonet wound in his throat  his mask had fallen off in his  death struggles  which must have been frightful  judging from the manner  in which his clothes were covered with dust and the way in which the  earth was kicked up all around him  never was a more horrible face  turned in such hideous blindness on the sun  his eyes were staring  wide open  and his huge mouth  fringed with blood stained froth  seemed  stretched in demoniacal laughter at some horrid and unearthly orgy in  which he was about to join  the sight was actually appalling  and barry  turned away from it in utter loathing to minister to those who were yet  within the reach of human aid     although  dangerously wounded  he found that  unlike the same number  of their comrades who lay stretched on the green sward without  his two  companions who had been brought to the earth without being killed  were  not beyond the reach of hope  with their antagonists  however  it was  different  and now that barry perceived the kid  or smith as we shall  now call him  was fast approaching his end  in the great anxiety that  he felt concerning the fate of his beloved  he knelt beside him and  implored him to give him any information that he might possess regarding  her  and so atone  before he crossed the threshold of the grave  for  any wrong that he might have been instrumental in doing her through the  machinations of others     the dying man raised his heavy eyelids for a moment and ere they dropped  again  managed  as if by one last effort  to point towards the prostrate  form of the principal antagonist of our hero  who still lay insensible a  short distance from him  his chest labored wildly for a few seconds  but  before he could ejaculate a single word  a sudden spirt of blood leaped  from his mouth and he was dead  wilson had passed away more slowly and  less perceptibly  from the moment he had been removed to the shed he  spoke but once  and that was when he uttered a feeble cry for water  on  beholding the latter dead  the stranger  who had lent such timely aid  to our hero  regarded the silent form with a curious expression of  countenance  and then turned away towards the house  in the meantime   the man who had for so far lain insensible  began to recover slowly   hitherto  his mask which hid but half his face  leaving his mouth and  chin uncovered  had not been removed  but now  as if in some uneasy  dream  his trembling hand tore it mechanically away  revealing  to the  utter astonishment of barry  the hooked nose and ghastly countenance of  greaves           chapter xvi       had o neill a single troop of cavalry when he broke the british lines at  ridgeway  the  d day of june        would have been the darkest that  had ever occurred in the annals of canada  he would have literally  annihilated all the forces that were brought against him on that field   and struck such terror to the heart of the enemy  as to have still  farther paralysed their volunteer service and destroyed the confidence  of the canadian people in the vaunted invincibility of the arms of  england for many a long day  if not for all time to come  but owing to  circumstances already referred to  he fought under every disadvantage  possible to an invading army  still  as the case stood  his triumph was  not the less brilliant or decisive  he routed the enemy  horse and foot   and had he been in a position to dispose of prisoners  he could have  taken a very large number with scarcely any effort  from the fact   that after the fearful charge that had broken through their lines  they  became completely panic stricken and demoralized  as he pursued the  flying forces towards ridgeway  what he would have given for a few  mounted riflemen or dragoons  but as a signal and glorious defeat was  more his object than the spilling of blood  he now felt  unsustained as  he was  it would be wise to fall back upon fort erie  in the hope that  reinforcements had arrived there  although he was unable to leave even  the smallest handful of a garrison to maintain the foothold he had so  far achieved  seeing there was nothing further to gain but everything to  lose by remaining longer in a position he could not by any possibility  maintain  in view of the hostile forces that he knew would soon be  pouring down upon him from other quarters  he paused on the verge of the  carnage that he might have wrought still further  and addressed himself  to securing the safety of his little band of heroes and occupying some  position on the frontier from whence he could  if hard set  effect his  transit across the river  or take up a final stand  fighting until the  last man fell in his ranks  if necessary to the success of any landings  that he might learn of as having taken place on the canadian shore at  other points  or in view of the intention of the authorities at buffalo  to reinforce him  and enable him to pursue the campaign  so gloriously  opened  with renewed hope and vigor     the news of the disastrous defeat of the british arms spread like  wild fire  throwing the inhabitants in the immediate vicinity of  ridgeway  as well as those of the village itself  into a state of  the most fearful consternation  houses were barricaded and property  concealed in the full anticipation that the conquerors would act upon  the world wide maxim   to the victors belong the spoils   but  as we  have already seen  it was the government and not the peasantry or people  of the country that o neill had come to overthrow  no better evidence  of this could be afforded than that shown by the circumstance  that   although two infamous and relentless robbers  and their scarcely less  culpable acquaintance and friend  wilson  had  for two days and two  nights  followed in the wake of his army  not a single opportunity was  afforded them of joining any portion of his command in a stealthy raid  upon the habitations or any of the people  or of taking an advantage of  the confusion and lawlessness which almost invariably surround the camp  of an invader  from first to last  his troops observed with singular  fidelity  his order that the lives and property of the canadians not  found in arms against him  should be held as most sacred  and in no  instance  although the temptations were various and marked  was this  injunction violated  on this head  major denison himself is most  explicit  and when we have the testimony of an enemy upon the subject   the most exacting incredulity cannot look for more conclusive evidence  in the premises     as already observed  when the rout and confusion of the english  commenced  they fled in all directions  but their main body set off  at  full speed  for ridgeway  through which village  and for a mile beyond  it  they were pursued by the irish forces  as was to be expected  their  wounded and dying strewed the way  while those who were thoroughly  acquainted with the locality made their escape to the shelter of  whatever woods or dwellings were to be found along the line of retreat   without actually bordering upon it  amongst these latter were greaves  and the persons who made such a sudden and deadly attack upon barry  while engaged in looking after the dead and wounded that were found  convenient to the house already referred to  this habitation ought to  have been well known to one of the party at least  for it was neither  more nor less than the residence of wilson  in which kate m carthy and  martha and her aunt had barricaded themselves  in the apartment of the  former  after having secured the outer doors  when they heard the tide  of war rolling towards them  wilson  understanding how the case stood  with them  when he found he could not gain admission  and being sensible  that they could not hear his voice  hastily effected an entrance by a  window in a sort of out kitchen  attached to the rear of the building   and soon admitted his companions  re bolting the door  and running up  stairs to warn the other inmates of the house not to speak or stir  but  remain barricaded as they were  until they heard from him again  this  done  he descended to where his comrades were  and was about to make  some observation  when the kid instantly drew the attention of greaves  to the party who were collecting the dead and wounded hard by  among  whom he at once recognized barry  in the twinkling of an eye  the  countenance of greaves was lit with an expression the most revolting   and turning to his companions he exclaimed in a low  hissing voice       now  my countrymen  we can avenge ourselves in part  at least  for  the disasters of the morning  there stand some of the most active and  dangerous of the army of the invader  and it is for us to take signal  vengeance on them  and not permit a single one of them to escape out of  our hands  we must not risk firing upon them at a distance so great   as should we chance to miss a single shot  they would be sure to slip  beyond our reach  let us rush out upon them then  with such arms as we  have at our command  and after giving them a volley pounce upon them  knife in hand  for they appear quite unconscious of any impending  danger  above all things  do not let that officer escape  he is the  most deadly enemy we have had to encounter to day  let him  at least  be  despatched without fail  and one thousand dollars shall be distributed  amongst you the moment i find him a corpse before my eyes      the kid  jack and wilson understood all this  for the first of the  villains had explained previously to the latter two  that greaves was  interested to an unaccountable extent  in the death of barry  and had   on that very morning  before he left ridgeway  promised him a round  sum if he managed to despatch him in any way  whether by stealth  or  otherwise  this he attempted  as we have already seen  but hitherto  without the desired effect  so that  now  when his game was within his  reach  and where he felt that he should be the gainer  no matter by whom  our hero was laid low  he immediately fell into this second proposition   as did all the others who stood around him     in a few moments  then  wilson procured the masks already noticed  they  being a portion of his stock in trade  and loading the three rifles they  had at their command  the door was stealthily opened and the assault  made  which had resulted in such disaster to themselves     when barry had recovered from the utter surprise occasioned by the  presence of greaves  and overcome the speechless astonishment into which  it had thrown him  he knelt down beside the wounded man  and began to  examine into the extent of his injuries  at first a few flesh wounds  about the shoulders and arms were all that he could discover  and as  these had bled freely  he fancied that the feeble condition of the  wretch  was attributable simply to a loss of blood  and  now  that  his wounds had been staunched  he believed he should gradually recover  strength  so as to be able to offer some explanation of his presence in  that part of the province  as well as of the circumstances in which he  now found himself  on a closer examination  however  and just about half  an inch below the nipple of his left breast  the young soldier perceived  a small discolored wound  evidently made with the point of his own  sword during the struggle that had just terminated  and from which not  a single drop of blood had flowed  outwardly at least  here  without a  doubt  all the danger lay  and as our hero was not versed in injuries   beyond the reach of external applications  all he could do was to bathe  the bitter  little  blue or discolored orifice  the lips of which seemed  to be pressed together in a vicious sort of manner  in some of the  water that had been previously procured at the adjoining house  when the  wounded men were removed from the open field  during this operation  the eyes of greaves were steadily fixed upon him  and when he had again  bathed the wound and adjusted the head of the unfortunate sufferer on a  pillow made of some hay found in one corner of the shed  the lips of the  patient became as it were suddenly unsealed  while the light of a larger  intelligence  rushed full into his eyes  at this period the wounded  companions of our hero were comparatively easy  on the temporary couch  made for them by the stranger  just before he disappeared and entered  the dwelling a second time  so that  for the moment  there was not much  to distract his attention from anything that greaves might vouchsafe to  say  some terrible foreboding having just rushed into his mind  based  upon the dying intimation of smith  that the man who lay thus helpless  and for aught he knew dying before him  was in some way connected with  the fate of his betrothed     scarcely had the conviction seized upon him  when greaves motioned him  to draw nearer  on eagerly complying with the request  he bent his ear  almost to the lips of the sufferer  who breathed with great difficulty   and whose voice was scarcely audible  so weak had he become  as though  by some effort of his indomitable will  however  he managed to collect  all his energies into his tongue and throat  and after whispering  through his compressed and pallid lips the single word  listen   began  slowly as follows      i am edward philip darcy  i have lost  for i know that my hour has  come      at the mention of the name  darcy   barry sprang to his feet  before  him lay the son of the man to whose machinations all kate s poverty and  hardships were clearly traceable  he it was that was now concerned in  the chancery suit  the decision of which was to be replete with such  serious results  as he presumed  to kate  his father had been dead for  some time  and had bequeathed his interest in the case to him  he was  the only person living who could stand in the way of the property it  involved being placed in the hands of its lawful heir  for the claims of  darcy  whatever they might be  expired with this  his only son  and  the last of his name and race  the consideration was startling in  the extreme  but as our hero saw how necessary it was to command his  feelings  and listen to whatever greaves  or darcy  as we shall now  call him  intended to say  he resumed his position and listened  as the  wounded man continued        i worshipped gold and power  and as there was some fear of the suit  of  which you have often heard  being decided against as  on the death of my  father  i stepped into his shoes  as a man who could make himself useful  to the government  and as one  in these troublous times  pre eminently  calculated to dip into the secrets of fenianism at home and abroad  and  apprise the british authorities of its power  aims and objects  as well  as make them acquainted with all its plans and prospects  although i  now surmise i had really to do with the privy council itself  i was  ostensibly employed by an important official connected with the castle  of dublin  who  besides paying me liberally for my services  promised to  influence the court of chancery in my favor  touching the decision now  pending  provided that  after doing all i could to unearth the leaders  and plans of fenianism in ireland  i crossed the atlantic and commenced  operations upon the brotherhood in america  of which the canadian  government seemed unable to say much that was definite  however they  might have apprehended mischief from this quarter  it was known at home   that but little confidence could be placed in the efficiency and honesty  of a cabinet that tolerated a shuffling inebriate at its head  so that  from the contradictory official documents reaching the castle from  canada  through the imperial authorities  it was  i suppose  deemed  advisable to send me out to learn something of the true state of the  case  influenced thus  i set about my work with right good will  and  after doing what i could in ireland  started for this country  with  fenian credentials that  i need not inform you  were obtained through  the treason of one of the organization who had gained admission into  the brotherhood for the simple purpose of betraying it  but who was not  sufficiently deep in its plans and confidence to damage it mortally      but the strongest inducement i had to visit america was the  circumstance of kate mccarthy s having emigrated to that country  and a  desire which i had long felt of gaining her affections and  if possible   making her my wife  for notwithstanding all the promises of the castle   i was fearful that the chancery suit would go against me  a suspicion  heightened by the conviction of my lawyer  i knew  of course  all about  your engagement to her  but being aware of your having entered the army   and of your having  through an adverse fate  been separated from her by  two seas  i thought that i should be able to estrange her feelings and  love from you  and make her mine before you again saw her face  but here  i had deceived myself  she was not to be moved  and i was repulsed at  every point  until  maddened by repeated failures  i determined to  make her mine by force  under the name of edward lauder  i first was  introduced to her  having managed to trace her from quebec to toronto   after rendering good service to the home government in the former city   from the first moment she beheld me  she seemed to entertain an aversion  towards me  and when she became aware of my intentions regarding  herself  and heard my repeated insinuations touching the general  faithlessness and bad character of private soldiers on foreign service   all semblance of cordiality was at an end between us  and soon   perceiving that her friends favored my suit  she left toronto and took  up her abode with some relatives in buffalo      here the wounded man became faint and silent  but nicholas  anxious to  hear all he had to say  bathed his brow and moistened his lips with  the water which still stood in a large wooden vessel by his side  this  seemed to refresh and revive his spirits  so that he soon continued   although with increasing difficulty      i knew that your regiment was stationed in the city where i first  met you  and the thought struck me  that if i could separate you both  forever  by betraying you into some act that would consign you to  a dungeon or penal servitude for life  or else make away with you  secretly  i should have some hope of accomplishing my designs regarding  her  and  in case the chancery suit was decided against me  reap the  full advantages of it after all      with this scheme deep within me  i followed her to buffalo  and there  became acquainted with the two men that i saw fall a short time since   who had engaged with me  for a certain sum  to keep their eyes upon  all her movements whenever i was absent from that city  and obey me in  everything  even to her forcible abduction into canada  if necessary   these men i knew to be desperate characters  so when i made this  arrangement with them  and was well assured that they would carry it  out if needs be  i started at once in your direction to see what  opportunities might there present themselves in furtherance of the  design that now seemed to absorb my whole being      a man like me  easily found out your city whereabouts  and  as you are  already aware  shortly after my arrival i formed your acquaintance and  that of o brien  whom i previously learned to be a relative of miss  mccarthy  to whom  since you had been quartered in the fort  she had  already paid a couple of visits  soon learning your fenian tendencies   and hearing that you had applied for your discharge and expected to  receive it immediately  i determined if possible  to prevent your  becoming a freeman on british soil  and to goad you into desertion   as it was rumored  that your regiment was soon to be called home  and  knowing that you would never accompany it  even though your discharge  were denied you  my object then was  to do  what i actually did do the  morning i accompanied you to the fort  while you were getting ready for  parade i managed to exchange a few words with your commanding officer   showed him my credentials from the castle  and told him that you sought  your discharge only for the purpose of joining a fenian army now  about to invade the province  with the further view of placing them in  possession of all you knew of the weak points of the fort  the theory  worked like a charm   you were denied your discharge  and now i knew you  would desert  in this  however  i was determined to help you  and  at  the same time  cause your betrothed to be lured in some way into canada   and consigned to some safe  out of the way keeping  where no one should  know of her  until i made my appearance as if by accident before her   and where i knew you would not be likely to seek her  from the fact   that once you were a deserter you would be out lawed forever from  british soil      you yourself furnished the means of this abduction in a manner the most  innocent  you will recollect the note sealed with a peculiar device   that you gave me to the deserter concealed in the city in which you were  stationed  telling him to entrust himself wholly  and without question  to whomsoever presented it  this note  after exhibiting it to your  friend  i retained and perceiving that it would answer my purpose  as  it mentioned no names  i enclosed it at once to my agents in buffalo   instructing them to present it to miss mccarthy  and without a moment s  delay  convey her across the river to some secluded spot  where she was  to be held at all hazards  until further orders from me  or until i  was able to visit her myself  my injunctions were obeyed  and all was  well  you had deserted and kate mccarthy was in my power      at this point of the infamous revelation  barry writhed in the most  fearful agony  and was on the eve of strangling the villain that lay  helpless before him  but his good angel  rushing to the rescue  restored  him to reason once more  and while great beads of perspiration stood on  his brow  he endeavored to compose himself to hear the terrible recital  to its close      but   continued darcy   after all my generalship you are master of  the field  and she cannot fail to become the possessor of the property  justly or otherwise so long estranged from her  although i fear it is  already embarrassed with heavy costs       but where is she now   exclaimed barry  as the gasping man finished his  terrible narrative      i know not   whispered the other with an effort   as i had not an  opportunity of paying the stipulated sum to the men who undertook her  abduction  they kept the place of her concealment secret from me until  i should perform my part of the contract  which i could have done this  day  only for the fate that has overtaken us  there is  however  no  doubt of her being in the province  and  likely  somewhere in the very  region where we now are       but   he whispered  with increasing difficulty and spasmodic  interruptions   i feel as if i were suffocating  water  water  oh  god    and with a bound that almost brought him to his feet  he sprang clean  from the ground on which he lay  and the next moment fell back heavily   a corpse     and so perished the four men  who scarce an hour previously were as full  of life and vigor as their hearts were of evil thoughts and designs   there can be no doubt  that they fell through the instrumentality   unconscious as it was  of the very individuals whom they had injured   differing only in their shades of criminality  in other relations   besides the one to which their fate may be mainly attributed  they were  doubtless guilty to an enormous extent  black jack  smith and wilson  were unquestionably old offenders  the two former having the heavy scent  of blood about them  while darcy or the pretended lauder or greaves   whatever his antecedents may have been  showed himself capable of any  atrocity known to the history of crime  the cup of their iniquity  was full  or they had not fallen so signally  thus  how steadily the  avenging angel follows in the footsteps of the wretch who makes war  upon humanity or does continual violence to the divine spark which  in  a greater or less degree  illumes the breast of every human being born  into the world  throughout the whole of their infamous career  these men  were well apprised of the fact  that they were engaged in open rebellion  against god and nature  and thus it was  that they were cut off in their  prime  without one sympathetic tear  to soothe their last moments or  hallow their graves     such were the meditations of barry  as he stood over the inanimate frame  of his implacable foe  but soon awaking from his revery  he felt how  dreadful to know that his beloved was  perhaps at that very moment   suffering in captivity or exposed to dangers consequent upon the  disturbed state of the country at some point  where  now that her  persecutors  who had at least provided for her daily sustenance  were  dead  she might  on this fact becoming known  be subjected to further  injuries  or wrongs that might be irreparable  the thought maddened him   and he was groaning aloud  in the agony of his spirit  when his ears  were arrested with the returning tumult of o neill s forces  after their  having made the second of june        memorable in the annals of canada   and those of irish independence  gazing steadily for a moment on the  terribly distorted features of his fallen enemy  he turned towards the  wide shed door to make some arrangements regarding the removal of his  wounded comrades  when his opportune friend again emerged from the  house  and rejoined him as he was stepping across the threshold      how fares it with your antagonist  now   enquired the stranger as he  cast a hurried glance towards the body of darcy  not knowing that its  spirit had already taken its flight forever      dead   returned barry   they who assailed us but a short time ago are  all gone to their last home  save the man who made his escape on your  arrival and interference  whoever he may be       that s sharp practice   rejoined the other   but in my opinion they  richly deserved what they got  for they fought as murderers and not as  men       would to heaven   returned nicholas   that one of them at least had  escaped the fearful chastisement inflicted upon him  for his death has  enshrouded in darkness a question which presses heavily upon my heart   and one that i have no means of solving  but pray  sir   he continued    do you reside in this vicinity  and if you do  perhaps you would be  kind enough to say  whether you have heard  recently  of the arrival of  a strange lady in this locality  who had been lured from her home and  friends under false pretenses  and who is  as i now have every reason to  believe  in questionable hands       may i ask your name   returned the stranger  without replying to the  question  and eyeing barry from head to foot   and may i  in addition   inquire what is the name of the lady to whom you allude       my name   replied our hero   is nicholas barry  and the name of the  lady is miss kate m carthy       mr  barry   hastily observed the stranger  extending his hand   my name  is henry evans  and my kinswoman  kate m carthy  is well and now in safe  keeping      at the mention of the name  evans  and the assurance that his betrothed  was safe and well  the heart of berry so bounded within him  that after  the blood had poured itself in one mighty torrent through his whole  frame and blazed over his face and brow for a moment  he became as pale  as death  and had not his newly found friend leaped forward and  caught him in his arms  he should have fallen fainting to the ground   recovering himself speedily  however  he leaned against the huge  door post at his side  and  breathing with more regularity  soon became  cool and collected     evans could well understand this sudden emotion  his own heart was  just in the vein to sympathize with it  so  in a moment the subtle  freemasonry of kindred spirits was established between them     who can explain it  here was a brave  young fellow  with the heart of  a lion  who had faced death in various shapes but an hour or so  previously  who had within the brief space of two days engaged hand  to hand in the most dreadful encounters with the enemy  without  experiencing the slightest sense of fear  or condescending to yield a  single inch of ground where he had set down his foot  here  we say  we  see him succumb at once  and rendered as helpless as a child at the mere  mention of a woman  and the assurance of her safety  although not by  any means thoroughly satisfied of her being in anything like imminent  danger  we shall not attempt to analyse the subtle and powerful  influences at work in such mysterious cases  but simply content  ourselves with the observation  that men who are susceptible of such  influences  and who strike at once to the first tap of their drum  are  not notorious for any great deficiency when brought face to face with a  more tangible and terrible enemy  and so thought henry evans as both he  and nicholas sallied forth  the former to report to the gallant o neill   and the latter to re enter the house already so often referred to  where  barry agreed to join him when he had seen the hero of ridgeway           chapter xvii       as remarked in a preceding chapter  kate m carthy had some distant  relatives in the vicinity of fort erie  and  as fortune would have  it  the two strangers who  on the night before the battle of ridgeway   interrupted the murderous designs of smith  belonged to the family with  whom she claimed kindred  one of these  henry evans  who had once met  her in toronto  on hearing from martha of her presence in wilson s house  and the circumstances that surrounded her  instantly requested to be  conducted to her  with a view to reassuring her and offering her the  protection of which he was satisfied she stood so much in need  the  recognition was mutually exciting  and on the part of kate appreciated  with heartfelt gratitude  explanations ensued which placed her friend in  possession of all that was  for the present  necessary for him to know   and it was at once agreed upon  that she should accompany him on the  ensuing morning to the residence of his widowed mother  not far distant   where she was to remain until barry or her friends in buffalo could be  communicated with  as her return to the united states  at a period so  disturbed and critical  was  of course  out of the question  new life  and hope welled up through this arrangement  and the poor girl  who  but a few moments previously believed herself in a position the most  dangerous and difficult  now found herself under the protection of her  own stalwart kinsman     martha  also  was delighted that the being she herself so loved had  made a discovery that not only quieted the painful anticipations and  reflections of her new friend  but gave herself an opportunity of  speedily abandoning forever a roof that had now become loathsome to her   as she had already made up her mind to accompany kate to the house of  old mrs  evans  who  notwithstanding her suspicious associations  loved  her for her own sake  and desired that she should forgo all further  intimacy with her uncle  and become the wife of young henry  in this way  matters stood until the morning of the second of june  henry remaining  throughout the night with the alarmed family  there being nothing to  fear in the direction of his own residence  which lay quite out of the  line of the two armies that were now about to close in mortal strife     the kid and the cousin of henry had  as already shown  gone in the  direction of the village  where  on arriving in due course  they found  the inhabitants in a state of the greatest consternation  as in port  colborne  here  also  was to be observed that spirit of disaffection  towards the british crown which led to the hoisting of the american flag  over a public building at the former place  when it was ascertained  that the province had actually been invaded  as yet  the troops  under lieutenant colonel booker had not arrived  and as there was no  opportunity for smith to ply his vocation  that worthy  emulating the  course pursued by his companion  rested quietly on his oars  until the  cars arrived with the army that was to contest the field of ridgeway  with the soldiers of o neill     on the arrival of this train  smith  as we have already perceived   encountered darcy  and had a conversation with him  the substance of  which is already known to the reader  as well as his subsequent falling  in with wilson and black jack in the immediate rear of the fenian  forces  before the british had proceeded from ridgeway towards chippewa   for the purpose of forming the junction with colonel peacock  the cousin  of evans had returned to wilson s with the intelligence that the command  of booker was about to move along the sodom road  upon which he was  begged  by henry  to start off and inform the widow  his mother  of  the approaching storm  and assure her that he should not take up  arms against the invaders  nor approach the scene of conflict  if the  contending armies joined issue at any point in the neighborhood  these  two young men  although born in canada  were  yet  the sons of irishmen   and felt that it would be criminal in them to raise their hand against  the freedom of the land of their fathers  or in behalf of a government  that had for centuries subjected it to every wrong and insult that could  be heaped upon it  this they felt  and entered into a mutual compact  to remain passive at least  should the tide of the conflict surge their  way  hoping only for the success of the cause of poor  down trodden  erin  without feeling themselves impelled to raise an arm in her  defense against a body of men made up in part of their friends and  acquaintances     this was not genuine patriotism  we know  but  still  under the  circumstances  it had its merits  in addition  it had enough of the real  stuff about it to be capable of being shaped readily  under certain not  unreasonable conditions  into a most useful and active element in the  cause  where a sentiment is not absolutely hostile  but on the contrary  even imbued with some slight degree of friendliness  it is easily  brought into line with the cause towards which it leans  and thus it  is with a vast body of the people of canada  who do not take any active  part in the great question that now so agitates the empire and shakes  the tyrant england to her very foundations  they would like to see  ireland free  but they do not care to come into collision with the  british authorities on the subject  could they lend her a helping hand  in secret and without detection  they would extend it cheerfully  but  they have not the nerve or moral courage to give her three cheers in the  market place  to this numerous class  these two young men belonged  and   singular as it may appear  we count on it for real support in the  final struggle that must take place between us and england upon this  continent  one day or other  we think  also  that in the hands and under  the fostering care of the out and out irish nationalists of canada  who  are ready to mount the scaffold at any moment  this friendly element  could be fostered into a great and irresistible power  for we have been  always of the opinion  that nine tenths of those who have even one   single drop of irish blood in their veins  can  by judicious treatment   be developed into the deadliest enemies of our ancient and implacable  foe  let these people be educated in the history and the wrongs of  ireland  as well as the extent to which england is indebted to that  unfortunate country for an that she now is  let them take the penal  laws for a text book  and the murders and confiscations of elizabeth   cromwell and the georges  for their  reading made easy   and no fear  but they will soon fall into the ranks from which they now  alas  keep  aloof  let them dwell upon the ages of famine  fire and sword to which  we have been subjected by a wretch who in the days of her gross darkness  came begging to our door in her breeches of blue paint and asked us for  an alphabet  while we were yet the day star of european civilization  and christianity  and then they will be enabled to justify in their own  bosoms any act that would tend to her humiliation  and comprehend fully  how bitter and eternal the enmity between us  and how just  whatever  stroke should seal her doom at our hands       seek music in the wolf s fierce howl       or pity in his wood shot eye     when hanger drives him out to prowl      beneath a rayless northern sky       but seek not that we shall forgive      the hand that strikes as to the heart     and yet in mock ry bids us live      to count our stars as they depart       we ve fed the tyrant with our blood         won all her battles   built her throne       established her on land and flood       and sought her glory  next our own       we raised her from her low estate      and plucked her pagan soul from hell     and led her up to heaven s own gate       till she for gold  like judas  fell       and when in one long soulless night      she lay unknown to wealth or fame     we gave her empire   riches  light       and taught her how to spell her name       but  now  ungenerous and unjust       forgetful of our old renown     she bows us to the very dust       but wears our jewels in her crown     this is the sentiment that fires the heart of every true son and  daughter of ireland  and all that is necessary to its general adoption  on the part of those related to us by even the most distant ties of  country  is the constant promulgation throughout the length and breadth  of the new dominion  etc   of sound information regarding the past and  present of our native land  and the true history of english legislation  affecting us     scarcely had the cousin of evans disappeared from wilson s on his  mission to the house of the widow  when the echoing woods in the  vicinity of the place gave evidence of the meeting of the two hostile  forces  the first discharge of the fenian rifles  after col  starr had  driven in the advance posts of the enemy  brought kate to her feet  and  kindled in her eye a flame so intense  while her white teeth glistened  through her parted lips  that she seemed the very personification  of female courage and patriotism  as she listened through her open  casement  and caught the distant cheer of her countrymen  the wild  music of which she thoroughly recognized  her bosom rose and fell with  terrible emotion  while her delicate nostrils were distended in a  sort of passionate ecstasy that might be termed the climax of the most  sublime enthusiasm  once more the saxon and the celt had joined in the  death struggle  and she felt as though she herself ought to be in some  way identified then and there with the conflict  thoroughly appreciating  the mighty issues at stake  she implored heaven  in language the most  fervent  to crown with victory the standard of ireland  and nerve the  arm of o neill in this the hour of his need  and as the moments rolled  by  and the tide of the contest ebbed and flowed upon her ear  her  excitement became so intense  that she begged of henry to venture out  to some point where  without personal danger to himself  he might learn  something of the actual state of the battle and the prospects of her  gallant countrymen     more than an hour had elapsed since the action began  when evans sallied  forth to gratify not only the wishes of his kinswoman  but to satisfy  his own mind as to how affairs stood  he was armed with his revolver  and dirk only  and felt  notwithstanding his former resolve  a strange  inclination to use them on the side of ireland  a cowardly shot   however  he could not fire  and as he knew nothing whatever of military  tactics  he at once dismissed from his mind the idea of participating in  the contest  perceiving that the conflict did not verge towards his own  dwelling  he was determined to keep his eye upon that which he had just  left  and yet venture as near the field where the battle was raging as  a brave man might  once he retraced his steps to inform kate that so  far as he could perceive  both armies were holding their own  returning  again to the edge of a patch of wood close by  here he had remained for  some time endeavoring to form an idea as to the probable issue of the  struggle  and occasionally warned of the perilousness of his position by  the rifle bullets that now and then sang around him  when suddenly  the red cross of st  george was seen to waver  and the next moment the  british lines were broken and scattered like chaff before the gallant  o neill and the victorious charge of his brave handful of heroes     the pulses of evans beat quick with a sort of strange  wild joy  when he  heard the shout of triumph which burst from the ranks of the irish  as  they swept like a whirlwind in the wake of their retreating foes  some  of whom stood at bay but to be instantly overthrown by their pursuers  a  desperate encounter between a knot of both forces took place quite near  to where he stood concealed  and here  also  the enemy bit the dust   although at this precise point  they were not outnumbered  it was here  that barry and his comrades were ordered to look after the dead and  wounded  the point being convenient to wilson s  and discernible from  it  although a clump of trees shut out the house from evans     when wilson saw that the day was lost  as quickly as possible  both he  and his comrades  including darcy and two or three others of a similar  stamp  who joined them in the field  fled and took shelter in his house   unperceived by evans or the victorious irish  from this dwelling   as already described  they sallied forth in a murderous assault upon  nicholas and his party  with what success has been already seen  to  account for evan s opportune appearance at the time of barry s being  sorely pressed  we have only to observe  that he witnessed the attack  without knowing the point from whence it proceeded  or recognizing the  persons who made it  and only hastened to the scene of action when he  perceived that the assailing party was masked and that barry was being  overwhelmed by unequal numbers  having gained the point where the  struggle was being carried on  the butt end of his revolver placed barry  on an equal footing with his antagonists  although as already observed   the young soldier had previously inflicted a mortal wound upon the most  important of his assailants     kate and martha were eye witnesses from their chamber window of the  whole of this supplementary fight  the former little dreaming  that the  officer attacked by the two ruffianly masks  was the man that was  all the world to her  she perceived  however  that he belonged to the  invading army  and such being the case  she viewed the contest with  breathless anxiety  looking every moment for the fatal stroke that was  to lay him low in the dust forever  until the sudden appearance of  henry on the spot  decided the day in his favor  the relief that she  experienced was so unutterable that she burst into tears  and when a few  moments subsequently  she learned from the lips of her kinsman himself  that the irish were every where victorious and the british forces  totally routed and in full retreat upon ridgeway  the intelligence was  too much for her  and she swooned away into the arms of martha  while an  expression of ineffable joy overspread her beautiful face     the death of wilson was broken to his wife as feelingly as might be by  henry  for a moment the poor woman was paralysed  and then gave vent to  a flood of tears of a character so strange  that we shall not pause to  analyse it here  her life had  indeed  been  for so far  a hard one   with him  and now that she had discovered his real character  she  almost felt grateful to heaven for removing him from the world he was  so dishonoring and the heart that he had already broken  yet he had been  her husband  and she remembered that she had loved him once  and here  the woman was touched within her  the die was cast  however  and now  it only devolved upon her to see his remains quietly consigned to their  last resting place  she saw him where he lay  kissed his cold lips and  wept afresh for all his long years of cruelty towards her  and then  turned away to her lonely chamber to which the body was removed  subsequently  martha was horrified only at the slaughter that surrounded  her  and had no place for grief in a bosom where affection for the  husband of her aunt had never existed  all she saw before her was her  beloved henry  alive and safe after the conflict had ceased between the  contending armies  while her heart thrilled with the purest delight  on learning from her lover  that which she was as yet to keep secret   namely  that the officer who had been attacked by the two masks opposite  the house  was the betrothed of kate who had joined the invaders with  the two fold purpose of striking for the freedom of his native land  and  unraveling  if possible  the mystery of her sudden disappearance from  buffalo     when our hero presented himself before the gallant o neill  that  distinguished soldier  who was already aware of the services rendered  by nicholas  complimented him on his bravery and informed him  that he  should now fall back on fort erie with his remaining forces  fearing  momently the approach not only of peacock s army but that of the  numerous other bodies of men that were being concentrated against him  from more than one quarter  orders were therefore given to dispose as  hastily as possible of the dead and wounded  some prisoners that were  taken having been already paroled  among whom was the officer taken by  barry on the preceeding day     when kate opened her eyes to consciousness again  she found herself in  arms other than those of martha  and looking up in a state of startled  amazement encountered the radiant face of nicholas as he pressed her in  ecstasy to his bosom  a cry of joy escaped her lips  as she clung to him  with an embrace as wild as though she feared some adverse fate should  again separate them  and a second time became unconscious  soon   nevertheless  she was revived through restoratives used by martha  but  yet in a state so confused that she could scarcely bring herself to  believe that all was real that was transpiring around her  by degrees   however  she became convinced that it was in reality her lover who  enfolded her to his heart  and all was well  in due time  explanations  were given  when it was determined that she should at once return with  him to her friends in buffalo  under the protection of the victorious  army and in a vehicle that henry volunteered to furnish for the  occasion  and drive in person  the distance to the frontier was but  short  and as henry s cousin had come up from the widow s to learn the  result of the battle  it was agreed that the one should remain in the  house of death with martha and her aunt until the return of the other  from fort erie  and that  in the interim  he should collect such of the  neighbors as were within reach  and have the body of wilson and that of  darcy and the others interred as speedily as possible     this once decided upon  barry possessed himself of such papers and  documents as were on the body of darcy  hoping thereby  to gain some  insight not only into the chancery case  but into the intentions of the  government or their plans in relation to fenianism  to him belonged of  right any information of this character that could be realized from a  dastardly foe who had been vanquished by his sword  but little  however   was gleaned from this source  beyond the fact gathered from a letter  received by darcy from his lawyer a short time previously  announcing  that there was no hope of his winning the suit  as some private opinions  expressed by those who composed the court  went to convey the idea that  the claims of kate mccarthy were of a character not to be set aside or  ignored even under the pressure of the castle  and further  that the  opposing counsel  who was a sterling lawyer and a man of influence  was  pressing the matter so  that a decision favorable to his client could  not fail to be given at no distant day     this was  of course  cheering to our hero  although darcy  just before  his death  had placed him in possession of the contents of the epistle   and prepared him for the intelligence it contained  kate received the  information without evincing any great degree of excitement her mind had  been so perplexed and agitated for the last few days  that her sudden  good fortune  in a pecuniary sense  seemed lost sight of in the other  events that had already transpired  and her unexpected restoration to  her lover  she was certainly surprised at the fate and the machinations  of the pretended lauder  and felt relieved by the conviction that the  murderous and unprincipled wretch who had wrought her and nicholas so  much wrong and hardship  and who had attempted the assassination of her  betrothed  and her own ruin  was no more  this was a great relief to her  overburdened heart  as she now knew  that a man so desperate as he   were he still alive  might manage  even yet  to work them some further  mischief     among the papers belonging to darcy there was found a small memorandum  book or diary  which  although a riddle to barry  is worth noting here   as it contained some entries that may possibly find elucidation outside  the recognition of our hero  one of them was as follows   toronto   april   th        paid to j g  m          for information regarding hib   benev  society   and again   april   d  saw hon  j  r      willing to  do all he can  but wants to be paid for it  mean fellow  whose tenderest  passion is absolutely scrofulous  they say   the other entries related  to mere travelling expenses  etc   and to some transactions which took  place in kingston and other points where darcy had been conducting  his operations in the interest of the english  as well as the canadian  government in addition to this  there was a draft for a considerable  amount  but as it needed the signature of the deceased  it was regarded  as valueless and permitted to remain in the pocket of the dead man  our  hero  however it fared afterwards  feeling a singular repugnance to  possessing himself of any property of this kind  or retaining a single  shilling of the current funds found upon the corpse  these latter were  subsequently devoted to defraying the burial expenses of the deceased   as well as those of his companions     when matters were so far arranged as to permit of the departure of our  hero and heroine  henry was about to leave the premises with a view  to procuring the vehicle that was to carry them to the frontier  when  wilson s team  that was discovered by a neighbor in the place where it  had been concealed  was driven up to the door  this was opportune   as evans  on perceiving the horses and knowing that there was a light  carriage under the shed  determined to put them into requisition at  once  soon  therefore  the three friends were bringing up the rear of  o neill s troops as the latter fell steadily back upon fort erie  with  the intention  as before stated  of learning whether landings had been  made at any other point  or whether there were the slightest hopes of  reinforcements crossing the river from buffalo     kate parted from martha with a warm embrace  and an assurance of lasting  friendship  while on her part  the betrothed of evans promised to visit  our hero and heroine in buffalo at no distant day  and there renew the  intimacy that had begun amid such clouds  although now surrounded with  sunshine  on the departure of our little party  then  barry s wounded  comrades being previously cared for under the instructions of o neill   the bodies of the four accomplices  wilson  darcy  black jack and the  kid  were interred with infinitely more decent observances than their  career in life seemed to warrant  the scruples of nicholas  however   regarding darcy s draft  were not shared by some of those who disposed  of his remains  as it was taken charge of by an individual who fancied  it might  one day  be turned to account by some person authorised to  receive it  of the mask who had escaped from the conflict opposite  wilson s  we may have occasion to speak in some future volume  although  evans surmised him simply some villain who had joined darcy or the kid  for the purposes of murder or plunder  be this as it may  the fugitive  had made good his escape  while those with whom he had acted for the  time being  suffered to the extent of their crimes           chapter xviii       it will be remembered that when the brave o neill and his handful of  troops fell down the river from fort erie on the night of the first of  june  to go into camp at newbiggin s farm  preparations were being made  by the british not only to overpower him with superior numbers but  to cut off his retreat upon the american shore and capture his whole  command  in view of this  troops were being despatched against him from  all points  while the tug robb  black with artillery and men  came round  from dunville and patrolled the niagara river between fort erie and  black creek  under command of capt  l  mccallum  this craft was manned  by the dunville naval brigade and the welland field battery  under capt   r s  king  all armed to the teeth with enfield rifles  on this vessel  there was  we learn  so much mirth when it was found that the fenians  were cut off from the american shore  that the force aboard it assumed  the air of a sort of military pic nic party  they laughed at the dilemma  in which they considered the invaders placed  and landed some of their  men at one point on the river to make a pleasant reconnoisance of the  enemy  and give them a warm reception as they came flying back  towards fort erie before the victorious queen s own or the university  rifles  either corps being considered quite sufficient to snuff out the  little band of patriots who dared to beard the british lion in his den   the wine and the jest passed gaily round  until so secure were they of  their position and the defeat of the invaders  a landing was effected  at fort erie where the skull and cross bones of st  george once again  floated over the village  and assured the inhabitants that they were  not yet lost to wheezy old england  lieut  col  denis was absolutely in  ecstasies and evinced such instances of personal bravery over his brandy  and water  that no one could have imagined  that  in the space of a  couple of hours or so  he should be found in a hay loft  shorn of his  fierce moustachois  and endeavoring to imitate the irish brogue  in the  slouched caubeen and coarse  gray habiliments of some poor  plundered  son of the sod  those who caught a glimpse of the brave commander as he  fled before the dangers that threatened him  report him as presenting  the most ludicrous appearance imaginable  and scarcely worth sending to  his account in a respectable manner  to this disguise alone  we learn   he owed his escape after the second carnage of the british by the irish  troops on the memorable day already named  and on their return from  limestone ridge     when o neill left ridgeway  after pursuing the routed english forces  through and beyond the village  he took the garrison road and  as  already mentioned  fell back on fort erie  here he came upon the welland  field battery and dunville naval brigade just referred to  flushed with  the victory of the morning  he was upon them like a whirlwind  and  in  the twinkling of an eye sent them flying to cover in every direction   his horse being much jaded with the march of the previous night  and the  dreadful fatigues of the battle of the morning  he could scarcely get  him to move a leg when he entered the village  and this circumstance was  near leading to the most fatal results  for  in passing a house in which  a number of the enemy had taken shelter  one of them came to the door   and seeing the animal going at so slow a pace  took deliberate aim with  a rifle  and fired  in the hope of bringing down his rider  the all but  murderous ball displaced the hair just over the right temple of o neill   lodging in a building opposite  the hero escaping all the dangers of the  day  to the amazement of those who had marked him galloping among the  carnage and bullets of the morning  in what might be termed a constant  hand to hand struggle with death  it is sometimes thus with the men who  show the most daring front in battle  and at the call of duty expose  themselves to dangers the most appalling  while such as are more  cautious often fall in their first encounter with the enemy     the british forces at fort erie  from the very nature of things  had the  fenians at great advantage on the return of the latter from ridgeway   the troops under o neill were fatigued and hungry  and after a desperate  battle and a long march  while the english had been resting on their  oars and feasting all day long  or at least for many hours  still   with all these advantages in their favor  they were whipped instantly a  second time  many of them being killed and wounded  captain king of  the welland battery losing a leg upon the occasion  and others being  terribly maimed  in addition  some of them were so terror stricken as to  roll from the bank into the river  and conceal themselves as best they  could  with their heads just over the water  and sheltered by whatever  chanced to float against them or project into the flood  in one case  they fought for a few minutes from behind some cord wood  but from this  they were soon dislodged by the terrible bayonets of their enemies   and scattered like sheep in and about the village  it was here that the  brave colonel michael bailey was dangerously wounded by a rifle ball  from a house where the enemy had already hung out a flag of truce  he  was riding at the head of his men when he was tumbled from his horse   the ball having entered his left breast  damaging the breast bone and  passing out just under his right nipple  the wound was at the time  considered mortal  but the gallant soldier survived it for upwards of a  year  still it was the occasion of his death ultimately  for  from the  hour that he received it  he drooped gradually into his grave  only  for the timely interference of o neill  the house from which this  treacherous shot was fired  like that from which he himself had nigh  received his death  would have been burned to the ground  he saw  of  course  how cowardly the act  to first hang out a flag of truce and then  follow the white emblem with so diabolical an attack  but he perceived   also  that if one building chanced to be fired  fort erie might be  burned to the ground  he therefore quelled the rising tempest at this  foul play  and with his iron will held the whole command in the hollow  of his hand and made those who composed it trample on their feelings  and curb their just anger for the good of the cause  a noble sentiment  emulated by the brave dr  edward donnelly  of pittsburgh  who at the  risk of his life and liberty  remained among the wounded of both parties  and assisted by the humane drs  blanchard and trowbridge  of buffalo   attended upon the sufferers even after the troops had recrossed the  river  and the british had again taken possession of fort erie     if we except the death of the brave lonergan and that of half a dozen  other noble fellows  whose names are unfortunately not at our command at  this moment  and take into consideration the capture by the british of  the christian and chivalrous father mcmahon  who  regardless of his own  personal safety  remained with the dead and dying  after the forces of  o neill had recrossed the river  the victory of ridgeway was completely  unclouded  this patriotic priest and some other friends of ireland are  now suffering for their love of fatherland in an english bastile at  kingston  in the new dominion  but the thought strikes us  the hour of  their redemption draws nigh  subsequently  one or two others  including  the gallant bailey  died from the effects of their wounds upon that  memorable field  but such are the contingencies of war  and such the  fate of some of the truest of our race     when o neill conquered and captured all the british force at fort erie   he at once sent a despatch to buffalo asking for reinforcements and  stating that if it were necessary to the success of any movement that  might be going on at some other point  he would hold fort erie and make  it a slaughter pen to the last man of his command  general lynch having  arrived at buffalo some short time previously  it was decided to send  reinforcements  but on its being found  subsequently  that a sufficient  number to be of real service could not be then sent to the canada side   the idea was abandoned and transportation prepared for the victorious  troops to re cross the river     when the british entered fort erie in the morning  they captured some  fenian stragglers who were  of course  set free on the arrival of  o neill from ridgeway  and now after being themselves captured in turn  they were released on their parole  o neill having no other means of  disposing of them  nicholas was not engaged in this latter affair  as   not anticipating it  he had kept in the rear of the army with kate and  evans  so that now when he came up  he was both ashamed and mortified  that even an engagement so trifling  when compared with that of the  morning  was fought without his having participated in it  however  the  day was doubly won  and as he explained to his gallant commander  the  peculiarity of his position  with a smile and a hearty shake of the  hand  he got permission to re cross the river with his betrothed  this  much accomplished  henry turned his horses and drove down the bank at a  quick pace  until he arrived at the house of a friend who kept a boat   and prevailing on him to take our hero and heroine to the american side  a little below the lower rock  he made his warm  adieux   with a promise  soon to visit buffalo with martha  where  meeting an express desire from  the lips of kate  he agreed that they should be made man and wife  and  so the friends parted for the time being  nicholas and kate  in the  course of an hour  finding themselves under the stars and stripes once  more  and beneath the hospitable roof that had so long sheltered her     here to their utter astonishment they found big tom who had just arrived  from canada  he having been obliged to turn over his establishment  hastily to his trusty friend  burk  and fly the province  as through  some successful espionage  his connection with the brotherhood had been  discovered  from a friendly detective who had learned the true state of  the case and the danger that threatened him  he received the hint that  urged him to make his escape  and which doubtless saved him from the  horrors of a dungeon if not from death  his sister was to follow him as  soon as a sale of his establishment could be effected  and then  as  he said himself   good bye to the tyrant until we meet on the battle  field   he was astounded at the disclosures regarding the pretended  greaves  and all but paralysed at the frightful position from which kate  had so miraculously escaped  when  however  he heard of the glorious  victory of the arms of the irish republic at ridgeway and fort erie   under o neill  he forgot everything else and leaped to his feet with a  cheer that shook the house to its very foundation  in the ecstasy of joy  that seized him  he took everybody near him by the hand ten times over   and added cheer to cheer until it was deemed expedient to recall him to  something like reason  a more genuine display of heartfelt pleasure and  patriotic feeling was never witnessed or experienced by any individual  or indulged in a manner more original or unsophisticated      tell it to me again  nick  tell it to me again   he exclaimed for the  twentieth time   and did you see them run  and how many of them are  kilt  have you a soord or a gun or anythin belongin to them  for if you  have i ll give you tin times the value of it for a keepsake       oh   replied barry  amused at this unusual display on the part of  the sedate and phlegmatic tom   there will be no lack of keepsakes in  buffalo to morrow  for the field was covered with their coats  arms  and  knapsacks  and some of these  i am sure  will be got for a mere song      this seemed to satisfy o brien  who soon flowed into conversation  touching all that had transpired regarding kate and darcy  as well as in  relation to nicholas himself  during the narrative  he referred to  the doubts that he had from the first entertained regarding the spy   although he confessed he was not altogether clear at times upon the  subject     after the fight at fort erie  many of the fenians  understanding that  they were not to be reinforced and that the enemy was about coming down  on them in force and hemming them in on all sides  made the best of  their way across the river  the great bulk of the command  however   stood by o neill  until about midnight  when a large scow attached to  a steam tug approached the canadian shore and took the whole of the  remaining forces on board  laden thus  they steamed out into the middle  of the river  when a    pound shot fired across their bows  from the  tug harrison  belonging to the u s  steamer michigan  brought them  to  doubtless to the extreme delight of acting sailing master morris  who seemed anxious enough to fire the gun and make the capture  although  they would at the moment have stuck to a child hearing the authority  of the united states  it is significant  however  that the  over officiousness of mr  morris has not tended much to his advantage as  he no longer belongs to the united states navy  he having been quite  as unfortunate as a certain district attorney  who  also  endeavored to  impress the government as to his undoubted unfriendliness to the cause  of irish freedom  the lesson may be profitable to government officials  at some future period  and prevent them from exceeding the simple and  unprejudiced bounds of their duty  be this as it may  about two o clock  on the morning of the third of june the scow was brought along side the  michigan and the officers taken on board that vessel and handed over  to the urbane and gentlemanly capt  bryson  its commander  as prisoners  under the authority of the united states  while the men were detained in  the same character aboard the scow     we are unable to trace to any particular source  the cruelty inflicted  upon these latter noble fellows  in keeping them for days in that open  vessel huddled together  and with the rain for a portion of that period   descending upon them in torrents  the disgrace of such a proceeding  has been so often denounced  that we dismiss this part of the subject  without further comment  ultimately  they were all liberated on  their own recognizance  to appear about the middle of the month at  canaudaigua  to answer for a breach of the neutrality laws  and there  the matter ended     now  however  the arms and ammunition belonging to the brotherhood had  been seized at every point except buffalo  in addition  the volunteers  who poured to the frontier from every side found themselves helpless   being without weapons or a commissariat  although the brave general  spear  with but a handful of men  made a descent subsequently upon  the enemy at st  albans  and put them to a most ignominious flight   according to general meade  of the united states army  between  thirty and forty thousand of these brave fellows were furnished with  transportation back to their homes at the expense of the government   while the arms that were seized were subsequently returned to the  authorities of the organization on certain conditions that have been for  so far complied with     thus ended the first invasion of canada under the gallant o neill   who  on his return from the campaign  was made a general and  commander in chief of the army of the irish republic  and who  in  addition  was subsequently elevated  to the position of president of the  fenian organization throughout the world  what his next move may be  we  are unable to say  but this we know  it will be in the right direction  and likely to succeed  he had no doubt been spared on the numerous  battle fields on which he fought so bravely  for some wise purpose  and  this purpose  we feel  is in connection with the freedom of ireland  for  the present  then  we bid him and his noble comrades adieu  hoping the  next time we shall have occasion to refer to them  the power of england  may be broken on this continent  and the green flag of old ireland  floating over the castle of dublin  our hopes of success were never  brighter than they appear to be at this  the moment of our writing   we have an immense army in preparation for the field  and a noble and  self sacrificing senate and band of organizers that may well command  his confidence and that of every irish nationalist in the world  for the  benefit of our readers  we here give the names of the members of both  these bodies  so that they shall be known and cherished throughout  the globe  we might single out from amongst them  that of the able and  patriotic p j  meehan  esq   editor of the  irish american   and bold  it up to the admiration of our countrymen everywhere  but where all have  acted so nobly we shall include all as worthy of praise alike  although  we could point out d  o sullivan  esq   secretary of civil affairs  a l   morrison  esq   of chicago  and a host of others  as eminently entitled  to our love and admiration  while  were we permitted to do so  we could  illumine our pages with the names of thousands of our fair countrywomen  and their beautiful american sisters who have laid their hands to the  good work with all the passion and nobility of their pure and generous  natures  but we must for the present content ourselves with the  following list and its recent modifications  at the seventh national  congress of the fenian brotherhood  which assembled at philadelphia on  tuesday

referred to the recent congress at philadelphia  the  following article from the philadelphia  age  november           will  be interesting to our readers as indicative of the present standing and  prospects of the brotherhood on this continent      one of the great events of thanksgiving day  outside of the festivities  of the home circle and the attendance on public worship  was the grand  demonstration by the irishmen of philadelphia in honor of the assembling  of the fenian congress in this city  this body  which consists of  delegates from all parts of the world  has been holding secret sessions  at the assembly buildings during the week  and important results have  been anticipated by the friends of ireland all over the world      the parade was quite a success  and reflected great credit on the  managers  mr  john brennan was chief marshal  assisted by frank  mcdonald  marshal first division  michael moane  second division  james  carr  third division  john mcatee  fourth division  michael d  kelly   fifth cavalcade  with the following aids  john a  keenan  r j  keenan   andrew wynne  thomas n  stack  capt  f  quinlan      the line commenced moving about half past

camp      there were three regiments of the irish republican army in line  they  numbered fully two thousand men  and were clad in their new uniform  the  three regiments parading were the eighth  ninth and twenty fourth  the  brigade was commanded by col  william clingen  major daniel a  moore   asst  adj t gen      the eighth regiment was commanded by col  p s  tinah  the ninth by col   j  o reilly  and the twenty fourth by col  michael kirwan  the military  was followed by numerous civic societies  there were nineteen circles  of the fenian brotherhood and three hundred delegates to the fenian  congress  besides the charles carroll beneficial society and the  buchanan beneficial society  the civic portion of the parade numbered  about five thousand men  the participants wore dark suits and badges   and pieces of green ribbon tied in the button holes of their coats      in the line of the procession was a handsome chariot drawn by six gray  horses  it was painted green and gold  the platform was covered with  beautiful oilcloth  and on it was placed a large brass bell  supported  on a green framework  this bell was kept tolling over the whole route  of the procession  in the rear of the chariot was a raised platform  on  which sat a beautiful daughter of erin  dressed as a goddess of liberty   holding a beautiful silk banner  she was seated underneath an arch of  gold stars  set on a field of white satin  and the top of the arch was  covered with holly and evergreen  the rear of the arch and the back of  the chariot were covered by a beautiful anchor of hope  made entirely  of flowers  the horses were decked with red  white and blue plumes and  large silk pennants  the whole arrangement made a very fine display  and  elicited much applause along the route      a banner was carried in the line of the civic societies  containing the  following  in gold letters on a field of green satin        delegates  remember the words of our martyred o brien  to unite in     god s name  for ireland and liberty  god save ireland      an outline cross in gold covered the front of the banner      along the route advertised  the sidewalks were lined by expectant  watchers  in some instances three or four abreast  they waited patiently  for nearly three long hours before the head of the line appeared  green  flags  with yellow harps and the words  erin go bragh   were plentifully  distributed throughout the crowd  the universal color was green  green  ribbons in button holes  green neckties  green badges  green flags   green coats  green sashes and green uniforms  the bands played  wearing  of the green   continually   green grow the rushes  o    the green above  the red   and  garry owen  were the only substitutes      there was a great deal of enthusiasm manifested all along the route   and the procession did not cease marching until the shades of evening  had approached      but to resume  once more  the thread of our story   in due time the  establishment of the harp was disposed of to advantage  and the sum  realized from it placed in the hands of o brien by his sister who  had made her way to buffalo according to his directions  when matters  quieted down in the vicinity of ridgeway  martha paid a visit to her  friend kate  and was soon followed by henry with a view to keeping his  word in relation to their marriage which took place on the same evening  and under the same roof with that of kate and nicholas  the joint affair  was a grand one  many guests having been invited to the wedding  among  whom were some officers of the i r a   and all that survived of barry s  comrades  tom  was in his glory  and as all the military men present had  been at ridgeway  the  pros  and  cons  of that important battle were  discussed in a manner the most lively and entertaining  then and there   it was voted  that although the invasion of the provinces had not at the  moment  resulted in any immediate benefits to the irish  it had given a  prestige to the arms of ireland in an individual and national sense  not  realized by that country for ages  not since the palmy days of our early  chivalry  had british soil been invaded by a hostile irish army  until  o neill broke the ice at ridgeway  and at no period in the history of  the nation had a mere handful of men performed greater miracles of valor  or been handled with more consummate judgment and daring     in the course of a few days  mr  and mrs  evans returned to their home  near ridgeway  and prevailed upon mrs   now the widow wilson  to dispose  of the house and property identified with so many unhappy associations   and near which the young wife could not now be induced to venture  in  the roomy and commodious dwelling of the evans  she found a home  and in  the course of time began to wear a more cheerful aspect  and forget   in a measure  the dreadful ordeal through which she had passed   nevertheless  no real sunshine visited her brow  as the shadow that had  fallen on it was too deep and sorrowful for even the peace and quiet now  promised her in the decline of her years     six months after their marriage  the barrys were apprised of their  success regarding the chancery suit  but so enormous were the expenses  attending it  that  after all  the benefits accruing from it were  something similar to those experienced by gulliver after his having  encountered and overcome all the difficulties that could have possibly  beset humanity  still they were richer through its having been decided  in their favor  and were enabled on the strength of it to purchase  a handsome dwelling near their friends of the rock  where they still  reside in comfortable if not affluent circumstances  tom and his sister   old bachelor and old maid  are once again in business  but this time not  in the restaurant line  and had we not given assumed names throughout  our whole story in so far as he and barry are concerned  his  establishment might be recognized at any period by those acquainted  with buffalo and its vicinity  or such as have passed along a certain  well known thoroughfare to black rock  his faith never falters in  relation to the independence of ireland  and he still keeps up his  connection with the brotherhood on both sides of the line  often  receiving from canada lengthy and mysterious epistles written by burk   over which he pores  from time to time  with sundry nods  winks and  significant smiles     henry and martha are now occasionally to be seen at the rock  the former  wearing a green necktie  and the latter as happy as the day is long   in the arms of both kate and martha are now two sweet prattlers  one  christened  john o neill barry  and the other  martha ridgeway evans   perhaps in after years they in turn may plight their vows on the banks  of the niagara  as kate and nicholas had done by those of the shannon   kate now and then visits her friends at their residence on the canadian  side of the lakes  but nicholas is of the impression  that he is quite  as well off in judiciously remaining at home to look after the affairs  of their establishment  sometimes  however  he gazes across the river  and wonders how soon again he shall have an opportunity of measuring  swords with the ancient enemy of his race  while tom has made up his  mind to handle a rifle himself  the next time that o neill sounds  to  horse      and so ends our story of ridgeway  with all the difficulties  loves   hopes and fears connected with it  throughout the whole of our narrative  we have been faithful to circumstances where the interests of the truth  required that we should be just and impartial  in this connection  we have been guided solely by personal knowledge and the evidence of  respectable eye witnesses  and by official documents of the campaign   the veracity of which are beyond any question whatever  here  then   we bid our readers good bye for the present  trusting that we may soon  again renew our acquaintance  and that we have not done injustice to any  party  for  notwithstanding the slight tinge of romance with which our  facts are interwoven  we have  after all  presented nothing for their  perusal at variance with truth  or  we hope  prejudicial to society      the end            although we are under the impression that others of these gentlemen  than those designated belong to the i r a  yet we are unable to give  their military rank  from the fact of our not being able  at the time of  our writing  to obtain proper intelligence on the subject           authentic report of the invasion of canada  and the battle of ridgeway     by the army of the irish republic  under general o neill  june           about midnight  on the   st may  the men commenced moving from buffalo  to lower black rock  about three miles down the river  and at      a m    on the  st of june  all of the men  with the arms and ammunition  were  on board four canal boats  and towed across the niagara river  to a  point on the canadian side called waterloo  and at   o clock a m    the irish flag was planted on british soil  by colonel starr  who had  command of the first two boats     on landing  o neill immediately ordered the telegraph wires leading from  the town to be cut down  and sent a party to destroy the railroad bridge  leading to port colborne     colonel starr  in command of the kentucky and indiana troops  proceeded  through the town of fort erie to the old fort  some three miles distant  up the river  and occupied it for a short time  hoisting the irish flag     o neill then waited on the reeve of fort erie  and requested him to see  some of the citizens of the place  and have them furnish rations for the  men  at the same time assuring him that no depredations on the citizens  would be permitted  as he had come to drive out british authority from  the soil  and not for the purpose of pillaging the citizens  the request  for provisions was cheerfully complied with     about    o clock a m   he moved into camp on newbiggin s farm  situated  on frenchman s creek  four miles down the river from fort erie  where he  remained till    o clock p m     during the afternoon  capt  donohue  of the   th  while out in command  of a foraging party  on the road leading to chippewa  came up with the  enemy s scouts  who fled at his approach     later in the afternoon  col  hoy was sent with one hundred men in the  same road  he also came up with some scouts about six miles from camp   here he was ordered to halt     by this time    o clock p m   information was received that a large  force of the enemy  said to be five thousand strong  with artillery   were advancing in two columns  one from the direction of chippewa  and  the other from port colborne  also  that troops from port colborne were  to make an attack from the lake side     here truth compels me to make an admission that i would fain have kept  from the public  some of the men who crossed over with us the night  before  managed to leave the command during the day  and recross to  buffalo  while others remained in houses around fort erie  this i record  to their lasting disgrace     on account of this shameful desertion  and the fact that arms had been  sent out for eight hundred men  o neill had to destroy three hundred  stand  to prevent them falling into the bands of the enemy  at this time  he could not depend on more than five hundred men  about one tenth of  the reputed number of the enemy  which he knew were surrounding him   rather a critical position  but he had been sent to accomplish a certain  object  and he was determined to accomplish it     at    o clock p m   he broke camp  and marched towards chippewa  and  at midnight changed direction  and moved on the limestone ridge road   leading toward ridgeway  halting a few hours on the way to rest the  men   this for the purpose of meeting the column advancing from port  colborne  his object was to get between the two columns  and  if  possible  defeat one of them before the other could come to its  assistance     at about   o clock a m    d of june  when within three miles of  ridgeway  col  owen starr in command of the advanced guard  came up with  the advance of the enemy  mounted  and drove them some distance  till he  got within sight of their skirmish line  which extended on both sides of  the road about half a mile  by this time  o neill could hear the whistle  of the railroad cars which brought the enemy from port colborne  he  immediately advanced his skirmishers  and formed line of battle behind  temporary breastworks made of rails  on a road leading to fort erie  and  running parallel with the enemy s line  the skirmishing was kept up over  half an hour  when  perceiving the enemy flanking him on both aides  and  not being able to draw out their centre  which was partially protected  by thick timber  befell back a few hundred yards  and formed a new  line  the enemy seeing he had only a few men  about four hundred  and  supposing that he had commenced a retreat  advanced rapidly in pursuit   when they got close enough  he gave them a volley  and then charged  them  driving them nearly three miles  through the town of ridgeway  in  their hasty retreat they threw away knapsacks  guns  and everything that  was likely to retard their speed  and left some ten or twelve killed  and twenty five or thirty wounded  with twelve prisoners  in his hands   amongst the killed was lieut  mceachern  and amongst the wounded lieut   ruth  both of the  queen s own   the pursuit was given up about a mile  beyond ridgeway     although he had met and defeated the enemy  yet his position was still  a very critical one  the reputed strength of the enemy engaged in the  fight was fourteen hundred  composed of the  queen s own   the   th  hamilton battalion  and other troops  a regiment which had left fort  colburne was said to be on the road to reinforce them  he also knew that  the column from chippewa would hear of the fight  and in all probability  move up in his rear     thus situated  and not knowing what was going on elsewhere  he decided  that his best policy was to return to fort erie  and ascertain if  crossings had been made at other points  and if so  he was willing to  sacrifice himself and his noble little command  for the sake of leaving  the way open  as he felt satisfied that a large proportion of the  enemy s forces had been concentrated against him     he collected a few of his own wounded  and put them in wagons  and  for want of transportation had to leave six others in charge of the  citizens  who promised to look after them and bury the dead of both  sides  he then divided his command  and sent one half  under col  starr   down the railroad  to destroy it and burn the bridges  and with the  other half took the pike road leading to fort erie  col  starr got to  the old fort about the same time that he himself did to the village  of fort erie    o clock p m  he  starr  left the men there under the  command of lieut  col  spaulding  and joined o neill in a skirmish with  a company of the welland battery  which had arrived there from port  colborne in the morning  and which picked up a few of the men who had  straggled from the command the day before  they had these men prisoners  on board the steamer  robb   the skirmish lasted about fifteen minutes   the enemy firing from the houses  three or four were killed  and some  eight or ten wounded  on each side     it was here that lieut  col  bailey was wounded  while gallantly leading  the advance on this side of the town  here forty five of the enemy were  taken prisoners  among them capt  king  who was wounded   leg since  amputated   lieut  mcdonald  royal navy  and commander of the steamer   robb   and lieut  nemo  royal artillery  o neill then collected  his men  and posted lieut  col  grace  with one hundred men  on the  outskirts of the town  guarding the road leading to chippewa  while with  the remainder of the command he proceeded to the old fort     about six o clock a m   he sent word to capt  hynes and his friends  at buffalo that the enemy could surround him before morning with  five thousand men  fully provided with artillery  and that his little  command  which had by this time considerably decreased  could not  hold out long  but that if a movement was going on elsewhere  he was  perfectly willing to make the old fort a slaughter pen  which he knew  it would be the next day if he remained  for he would never have  surrendered     many of the men had not a mouthful to eat since friday morning  and  none of them had eaten anything since the night before  and all after  marching forty miles and fighting two battles  though the last could  only properly be called a skirmish  they were completely worn out with  hunger and fatigue     on receiving information that no crossing had been effected elsewhere   he sent word to have transportation furnished immediately  and about  ten o clock p m  capt  hynes came from buffalo and informed him that  arrangements had been made to recross the river     previous to this time some of the officers and men  realizing the danger  of their position  availed themselves of small boats and recrossed  the river  but the greater portion remained until the transportation  arrived  which was about    o clock on the night of june    and about    o clock a m  on the morning of the  d  all except a few wounded men were  safely on board a large scow attached to a tug boat which hauled into  american waters  here they were hailed by the tug harrison  belonging  to the u s  steamer michigan  having on board one    pounder pivot gun   which fired across their bows and threatened to sink them unless they  hauled to and surrendered  with this request they complied  not because  they feared the    pounder  or the still more powerful guns of the  michigan  which lay close by  but because they respected the authority  of the united states  in defence of which many of them had fought and  bled during the late war  they would have as readily surrendered to an  infant bearing the authority of the union  as to acting master morris  of the tug harrison  who is himself an englishman  the number thus  surrendered was three hundred and seventeen men  including officers     the officers were taken on board the michigan  and were well treated by  capt bryson and the gentlemanly officers of his ship  while the men were  kept on the open scow  which was very filthy  without any accommodation  whatever  and barely large enough for them to turn round in  part of the  time the rain poured down on them in torrents  i am not certain who is  to blame for this cruel treatment  but whoever the guilty parties are  they should be loathed and despised by all men  the men were kept  on board the scow for four days and then discharged on their own  recognizances to appear at canandaigna on the   th of june  to answer  to the charge of having violated the neutrality laws  the officers were  admitted to bail  the report generally circulated  and  i might say   generally believed  that the pickets were left behind  and that they  were captured by the enemy  is entirely false  every man who remained  with the command  excepting a few wounded  had the same chance of  escaping that o neill himself had     to the extraordinary exertions of our friends of buffalo  f b   gallagher  wm  burk  hugh mooney  james whelan  capt  james doyle  john  conners  edward frawley  james j  crawley  m t  lynch  james cronin  and  michael donahue  the command were indebted for being able to escape from  the canadian side  col  h r  stagg and capt  mcconvey  of buffalo  were  also very assiduous in doing everything in their power  col  stagg had  started from buffalo with about two hundred and fifty men  to reinforce  o neill  but the number was too small to be of any use  and he was  ordered to return  much praise is due to drs  trowbridge and blanchard   of buffalo  and surgeon donnelly  of pittsburg  for their untiring  attendance to the wounded     all who were with the command acted their parts so nobly that i feel a  little delicacy in making special mention of any  and shall not do so  except in two instances  one is michael cochrane  color sergeant of  the indianapolis company  whose gallantry and daring were conspicuous  throughout the fight at ridgeway  he was seriously wounded  and fell  into the hands of the enemy  the other is major john c  canty  who lived  at fort erie  he risked everything he possessed on earth  and acted his  part gallantly in the field     in the fight at ridgeway  and the skirmish at fort erie  as near as can  be ascertained  the fenian loss was eight killed and fifteen wounded   among the killed was lieut  e r  lonergan  a brave young officer  of  buffalo  of the enemy  thirty were killed and one hundred wounded                     heart  and of the love  that came to it at last  of his threatened destruction  and the strange  and wonderful way of his salvation     so shall i begin and tell     he left his gray castle at the dawn of the morning  and with many a knight  to bear him company rode  not eager and swift  like a prince who went to  find a treasure  but steady and slow  as we should go to meet sorrow  not  one of the hundred men who followed dared to lilt a lay or fling a  laughing jest from his mouth  all rode silent among their gay trappings   for so saith a song         it was the black earl roderick        who rode towards the south       the frown was heavy on his brow          the sneer upon his mouth          behind him rode a hundred men        all gay with plume and spear       but not a one did lilt a song        his weary way to cheer          so stern was black earl roderick        upon his wedding day       to none he spake a single word        who met him on his way      and of those that passed him as he went there were none who dared to bid  him god speed  and only one whispered at all  she was mora of the  knowledge  who was picking herbs in a lonely place and saw him ride      there goeth the hunter   said she    tis a white doe that thou wouldst  kill  high hanging to thee  my lord  upon a windy day      and of all the flying things he met in his going  one only dared to put  pain upon him  and she was a honeybee who stabbed his cheek with her  sword      would i could slay thee   she cried   ere thou rob the hive of its  honey      and of all the creeping things that passed him on his way  only one tried  to stay him  she was the bramble who cast her thorn across his path so his  steed wellnigh stumbled      would i could make thee fall  black earl  who now art so high  ere thou  rob fruit from the branch      only one living thing upon the mountains saw him go without mourning  and  he was the red weasel who took the world as he found it      tears will not heal a wound   saith he   but they will quench a fire  thy  hive is in danger  bee   quoth he   bramble  thy flowers are scattered and  thy fruit lost      but the black earl did not heed or hear anything outside his own thoughts   they were sharper than the bee s sword and less easy to cast aside than  the entrapping bramble     when he reached the castle wherein his bride did dwell  he blew three  blasts upon the horn that hung beside the gate  and in answer to his call  a voice cried out to him  but what it said i shall sing thee  lest thou  grow weary of my prose         come in  come in  earl roderick         come in or you be late       the priest is ready in his stole         the wedding guests await           and then the stern earl roderick        from his fierce steed came down       the sneer still curled upon his lip         his eyes still held the frown          he strode right haughtily and quick        into the banquet hall       and stood among the wedding guests         the greatest of them all          he gave scant greeting to the throng         he waved the guests aside       now haste  for i  earl roderick         will wait long for no bride          and i must in the saddle be        before the night is gray       so quickly with the marriage lines         and let us ride away       and now shall i tell thee how  as he spoke thus proud and heartlessly  his  little bride came into the hall  so white was she  and so trembled she   that many wondered she did not sink upon the marble floor and die     her mother held her snow white hand  weeping bitterly the while      if i had my will   thought she   this thing should never be  oh  sharp  sorrow   sobbed she   this for a woman  my trouble thou art  and my  thousand treasures      her father  seeing the frowning earl  muttered in his beard      would there were some other way  stern is he and hard  to wear a young  maid s heart   and then aloud he spoke  laying his hands upon the yellow  curls of his child   this is the golden link that binds the clans  god s  sweet love be upon her head  for she hath healed a cruel and evil quarrel  between the two houses  lift up your voices  my comrades  and make ye  merry  it is a good deed you have helped in to day      now  when the guests turned with their laughter and gentle jesting to the  newly married pair  the black earl relented not his frown  with scant  courtesy and brief good bye he mounted upon his fretting steed  vowing he  could no longer stay  up before him they lifted the young bride       tis a rough place to carry the child   wept the sad mother     but her father smiled upon the black earl      where but upon his heart should she rest  is that not so  my son       if it be not cold   muttered the sullen bridegroom  drawing his rein      wrap thy cloak about her   cried the father  waving farewell      wrap thy love about her   wept the mother  hiding her face     so rode the black earl and his bride  followed by his sullen men at arms   gay with their wedding favors     to his weary little bride he spoke no gentle word  though she fluttered  weeping upon his breast like to some wounded thing     for in his heart the gloomy earl spake bitterly  and said he      not upon thy hand did i hope to place my golden ring  i have put my own  true love aside  to keep the clans together  and wedding thee thus have i  been false to the desires of my heart  so do i turn from thee who art my  bride      thus did he take her to his castle in silence  and  lifting her from his  steed  bid her enter the strong gates before him     so shut they with a clang upon her youth and her merry heart  and she  became the neglected mistress of the gray towers she had looked on from  afar  and bride of the great earl she had dreamed of so long     but to the black roderick she was as nothing  he sought her not  neither  did he speak of her  she was but the cruel small hand that closed upon his  heart and drew it from its love  claiming him in honor her own  and to her  claim was he faithful  turning even his thoughts away  lest he should be  false to his vow  but no more than this did he give her     so was she left alone  the young bride who did not understand a man s  ways  and  fearing where she loved  hid from his presence lest he should  look upon her in hate  oft had she dreamed of the wonder of being the wife  of this proud earl  in trembling desire and hope  hearing her parents  speak of him and of the troth  oft had she listened to their murmured  words  as they spoke of the clans and the peace these two could bring      stern he is  and black for the young child   said her mother   and i am  afraid   but the child stole away to the hill behind her father s castle   and there looked into the valley of baile ata cliat to watch the white  towers of the black earl glistening in the sun  to dream and to tremble     and as she gazed a honey bee hummed in her ear   go not to the great  city      and as she smiled she raised her hand between her eyes and the far off  towers so she could not see      nay   quoth she   it is a small place  my hand can cover it       ring a chime   saith she to the heather shaking its bells in the wind    ring for me a wedding chime  for i am to be the bride of the earl  roderick      she kissed the wild bramble lifting its petals in the sun      i shall return to thee soon      and so  springing to her feet  she ran laughing down the hill  and as she  ran the spirit of the hills was with her  blowing in her eyes and lifting  her soft hair      i shall return to thee soon   she said again  and so entered her father s  house and prepared herself for her betrothed     what of her dream was there now  she was indeed the earl s bride  but   alack  she was divorced from his heart and was naught to his days     never did she sit by his knee when he drew his chair by the fire  weary  from the chase  nor lean beside him while he slept  to wonder at her  happiness  down the great halls she went  looking through the narrow  windows on the outside world  as a brown moth flutters at the pane  weary  of an imprisonment that had in its hold the breath of death     weary and pale grew she  and more morose and stern the black earl  and of  their tragedy there seemed no end  but when a year had nigh passed  one  rosy morning a servant lass met black roderick as he came from his  chamber  her eyes heavy with tears     and of what she said i shall sing  lest thou grow weary of my prose         alas   she said   earl roderick         tis well that you should know      that each gray eve  lone wandering         my mistress dear doth go          she comes with sorrow in her eyes        home in the dawning light       my lord  she is so weak and young        to travel in the night           now stern grew black earl roderick         but answered not at all       he took his hunting harness down        that hung upon the wall            then quickly went he to the chase         and slowly came he back       and there he met his old sweetheart         who stood across his track      so shall i tell how she  sighing and white of face  laid her soft hand  upon his bridle rein so he could not go from her  her breath came out of  her like the hissing of a trodden snake  poisoning the ear of the  horseman      bend to me thy proud head  black earl   quoth she   for it shall be low  enough soon  this is a tale i bring to thee of sorrow and shame  bend me  thy proud neck  black roderick  for the burden i must lay upon it shall  bow thee as the snow does the mountain pine  bend to me thine ear      to him then she said      where goeth your mistress       what care i   said the black earl   since she be not thou       if she were i   said his lost love   she would seek no other save thee  alone       what sayest thou   said the black earl  pale as death      each night she goeth through the woods of glenasmole to the hill of brown  kippure  and there lingereth until the dawn be chill       who hath her love   saith the black earl      a shepherd  or mayhap a swineherd  who knoweth   quoth the serpent voice    by no brave prince art thou supplanted      at this the black earl struck his hand upon his breast      lord pity me   quoth he   that in my time should come the stain upon our  honored house  my name  that was so white  shall now blush red  my proud  ancestors will curse me from their tomb  let thou go my rein  that i may  seek this wanton and give her ready punishment      so quick he drew the rein from her hand that she wellnigh stumbled  and  like one bereft of mind he rode through the woods and up the hill seeking  his false bride  high and low he searched  but no sign of his lost  mistress did he discover  out in the distance he saw the shining city of  baile ata cliat  on the near wood side of which his gray towers stood  he  could see the flag on its topmost turret waving in the breeze like a  beckoning finger calling him back from his futile search  he turned him  about  and on every side of him were the shadowy mountains watching him  and appalling him with their mystery  impatient he turned his eyes upon  the ground  a bramble moving in the wind cast itself about his feet  he  crushed it under his heel  a bee darting from one of the trodden flowers  made a battle cry  and bared her sting for his neck  he struck it down  among the leaves  following its fall  his eyes  drawn by some other eyes   rested on a hollow by a stone  there he saw gazing at him the whiskered  face of a red weasel  looking without pity  without fear      evil beast   said the black earl  glad to speak  for the silence of all  the listening things who watched him made his heart beat with unwonted  quickness  and he knew they were so many silent judges reading the evil of  his soul   get thee gone   quoth the black earl   darest thou gaze upon me  without fear      but the red weasel  resting at the doorway of his hole  did not blink a  lid of his sharp eyes      who art thou that evil should droop ashamed before thee   said a voice   and the black earl turned as though a stone had struck him     now  when he looked east and west  no one could he see  but when he turned  him south  there among the trees he saw an old  bent woman gathering  herbs  he turned his horse and  full of rage  drove it towards her      was it not thy voice that hurt my ears as i stood upon the hill   quoth  the black earl  his tongue silken in his rage      nay   said the ancient crone   i heard but the linnet s song upon the  tree  and the sound of running water that is murmuring in the grove   listen  and thou  too  shalt hear       nay   quoth she again  for the black earl scowled so at her that she  feared to be silent   if i said this thing  why should it vex the ear of  so proud a knight  yonder black rook did look into my face with an  inquisitive eye as i plucked my herbs and harmed no man  so i  angry at  the wicked one  cursed him begone  as he flew affrighted at my hand  i  turned my eyes into my own heart  the birds and i  do we not both root in  the cold earth  seeking to draw from it our desires  black and ill looking   we dig all day   who art thou   quoth i to myself   that evil should fly  before thee   wicked that i am   cried the witch   and sorrow upon me that  my words have vexed thine ears      now the black earl did look upon her in anger  and but half believed her  tale  his trouble being heavy upon him  he bade her leave her lamenting  and answer his question      there is one   quoth he   who doth wander upon the hill side  far from  her home  a lady of high degree  sawest thou any such   saith he   for i  have sought her long      now will i sing thee what was said and what happened  lest thou grow weary  of my prose         i have not seen your lady here          the withered dame replied       but i have met a little lass        who wrung her hands and cried          she was not clad in silken robe         nor rode a palfrey white       she had no maidens in her train         behind her rode no knight          but she crept weary up yon hill        and crouched upon the sward       i dare not think that she could be        spouse to so great a lord           now darkly frowned earl roderick         he turned his face away       and shame and anger in his heart        disturbed him with their sway          for he had never cared to know        what his young bride would wear       he gave her neither horse nor hound         nor jewels for her hair      now shall i tell how the black earl clapped his hand upon his dagger  and  said in a great rage   where went this little lass  and whom hath she by  her side  for whoever he be  i shall show to him no pity  neither shall  her tears save her  nor shall thy age serve thee  witch  if thou hast  spoken not the truth  whither went they  so i may follow  as the hound  goes on the trail of the deer       oh  sharp sorrow thy anger is   cried the old crone   what can i say   save what my eye hath seen and my ear hath heard  the little lass passed  me as i gathered my herbs under the dew  she hath by her side no lord nor  lover  she went sad and alone  here climbed she the height of the hill   and there sat she making her lament       and what lament made she   said the black earl  putting his dagger into  its sheath      once called she on her father  as one who drowns in deep waters would  call upon a passing ship  twice called she upon her mother  as one would  call upon a house of rest or of hospitality  thrice called she upon earl  roderick  as one would call at the gates of paradise  there to find rescue  and love       and said she naught else   said the black earl  his head upon his breast      yea   quoth the crone   when she called upon her father  she smiled  through her tears   didst thou know i perish   quoth she   thy arms would  reach to save me       and when she called twice upon her mother  her mouth smiled even the  same   for didst thou learn my hunger  thy heart would warm me to life  again   but when she called three times upon earl roderick  she paused as  though for an answer  and smiled no more   thee   quoth she   i perish  for  i hunger for  thou lovest me not at all       so did she sit and make her moan upon the hill  and here watched she the  lights in the far windows of her lost home quench themselves one by one    now   quoth she   my mother sleepeth  and now my father  and now by all  am i forgotten   then did she steal  in the dim light  down from the hill   and i saw her no more       what didst thou tell to her  old witch   quoth the black earl   as she  passed weeping  didst thou speak to her no word       i stopped her as she passed me  proud earl   quoth the crone   for she  was gentle  and held her head not too high to look upon one old and near  unto death       weep not   said i   but spread to me thy fingers  so i may read what  fate thou holdest in thy palm   and like a child she smiled between her  tears       look only on luck   quoth she   oh  ancient one  lest my heart break  even now   i spread her pink fingertips out as one would unruffle a rose   and read therein her fate       and what read you there   said the black earl  impatient with her delay      i read   quoth the crone   and if i say  thou must keep thy anger from  me  for what i read i had not written         i traced upon her slender palm        that luck was changing soon       i swore that peace would come to her        before another moon          i said that he who loved her well        would robe her all in silk       and bear her in a coach of gold         with palfreys white as milk          i told  before three suns had set        he d kneel down by her side       that he she loved would love her well         and she would be his bride        this before three suns have set   so read i   quoth the crone     now  when the black earl heard so much  he would hear no more  pallid grew  his angry cheek  and his eyes were full of fire  he flung himself upon his  horse  and  sparing not the beast  galloped home      in the highest tower shall i lock the jade   quoth he   lest she bring me  shame  for what her palm had writ upon it one must believe  and who dare  love her  save i who will not  and should i die  wherefore should she not  be another s  and should i not die  but this no man dare  for i shall tear  his tongue from his mouth  his ear from his cheek  his heart from his  body  ere he speak or listen to a word to my dishonor      now  when he reached his castle  no man ventured to speak to him  or look  upon him with too inquisitive an eye  for his anger was such that one  trembled to approach him     and at the gate of his castle sat his old love upon her palfrey  with a  stern face and grim  behind her  resting upon their way  came her  followers  knight and lady  gay with banner and spear  whispering in their  telling of the story      a curse upon the wandering feet that have brought disgrace upon thy  house   quoth his old love  her hand so tight upon the rein that the two  pages could hardly keep the horse from rearing     but the proud earl to her made no answer  neither to bid her welcome  nor  to bid her go  nor to speak of his fears  into his breast he locked his  grief so that none might know the strain wellnigh broke the stony casket  of his heart     when he leaped from his horse there came to him his little brother      my grief   said the boy   what has happened in the night  for i heard the  banshee sobbing so bitterly through the dark      no answer made the black earl to the boy  neither did he lift him in his  arms nor chide him for his weeping  but passed silent into his own  chamber  and crouched within his chair  when after a time he raised his  eyes  he seemed to see his young bride gazing upon him from the open door   and in his anger he sprang to seize her  but only the empty air came to  his hands     he mounted the marble stairs to her chamber to seek her there  but only  found a sewing maid  pale and deadly faint      oh  sharp sorrow   quoth she   from what i have seen this night  mary  protect me  a white ghost have i seen  evil it may bring to me  a white  ghost with dim eyes of the dead       whither went she   said the black earl  angry in his need      into thy chamber  great earl   cried the maid   i saw her at thy bed head  weeping piteously       it was thy lady   quoth the earl   lead me her way  and stop thy  lamentation       my grief   the girl said   her way i know not  when i  deeming her my  mistress  reached her side  she was no more  it is an evil day that cometh  upon us      now  when the proud roderick saw the girl so full of fear  he chid her  cruelly and bade her go  yet when she had left him he felt a strange and  unwonted coldness settle upon his heart     the anger against his young bride was quenched  and a dewlike fear grew  upon him  but of what befell him i shall now sing to thee  lest thou grow  weary of my prose         all silent black earl roderick        went to his room away       full angry  with his throbbing heart        and fitful fancy s play          he sat him by the bright hearth side         and turned towards the door       and there upon the threshold stood        his lady  weeping sore          he chased her down the winding stair         and out into the night       but only found a withered crone         with long hair  loose and white          come hither now  you sly faced witch         come hither now to me       say if a lady all so pale        your evil eyes did see           oh  true  i saw a little lass         she went all white as snow       she crossed my hands with silver crown        just two short hours ago           what did you tell the foolish wench         who must my lady be       the false tale you did tell to her        you now must tell to me           i hate you  black earl roderick         you re cruel  hard  and cold       yet you shall grieve like a young child        before the moon is cold          this did i tell her  like a queen        she d ride into the town       and every man who met her there        would on his knees go down          i said that he who followed none        would walk behind her now       and in his trembling hand the helm        from his uncovered brow          then he should walk  while she would ride         through all the town away       and greater than earl roderick        she would become that day       and now shall i tell how laughed the black earl aloud and scornful at the  witch s tale      no lady in the land   quoth he   could so enslave me  and no woman yet  was born who hath my honor and glory      so spoke earl roderick  and by these words shalt thou hold him  heart whole  and vain withal  for the hour of his sorrow had not yet struck     now turned he to the dame  and  chiding her  bade her begone      thy tale   saith he   is full of weariness  it hath neither wisdom nor  truth      turning from her in anger  home went he  and flung himself before the  dying fire in his chamber  a frown between his brows  and again a cold  fear turned closely about his heart  raising his eyes  he saw no more  terrible a thing than his young bride  with a face of grievous pain   looking upon him from the door  then he spoke her gently      come   quoth he   sad faced one  why dost thou torment me  one question  only shall i ask thee  and this must thou answer  whom hast thou met upon  the hill  for the witch woman hath told me a wearisome tale  which i shall  not lend my ear to      now  when he spoke  his young bride neither answered nor came  but gazed  from the threshold upon him in silence  so he got up in anger and went her  way  through the chamber strode he  and she was yet before him  and  without sound went she down the hall and stair  so out through the open  door  and the men at arms let her pass  though the black earl bid them  stay her feet  and gazed bewildered  seeing only their stern master  running alone  with fierce eyes  such as a hound doth cast upon a young  hare  quick as the black earl ran  the little bride was before     through sleepy woods and honey perfumed plains  all through the night did  he chase her  but never once did he reach her  nor ever once did she pause  to rest     when the morning sun was high  she led him up to the lights of brown  kippure  and there vanished from his sight     now  when the black earl perceived this wondrous thing  he felt his heart  sink with utter weariness  and without more seeking fell upon the moss   had his eyes been not so hot with anger  slow tears of sorrow would have  forced their way upon his cheeks  for now that he had her not his desire  was strong upon him to behold his bride     as he lay upon the heather  he heard the shrill voice of his little  brother clamoring by his side      be still   quoth he   for thou hast frightened away a fair dream that i  fain would follow       but i would tell thee   said the little brother   of a strange thing  and  one to set thee full of laughter       nay   quoth the black earl   of that i have no desire  lest thou place  upon my head a cap and bells  and call me fool roderick       and wherefore   said the little brother   shouldst thou laugh at fool  roderick       because   quoth the black earl   he hath found a strange jewel when he  hath lost it       thy words i do not understand   saith the little brother   what was the  strange jewel that he hath and yet hath not       love   quoth the black earl      that neither do i understand   saith the little brother   but now thou  must listen to my story      and of what he saith shall i sing  for his voice was sweeter than prose         oh  brother  brother  come up to the lake waters gray       come up to the shore where i play       for  oh  i saw on the bank asleep      a fair white nymph  and the slow waves creep       to bear her away  away          oh  brother  brother  i watched her through the day       saw her hair grow jewelled with spray       once her cheek was brushed by a robin s wing       and a finch flew down on her hand to sing       and was not afraid to stay          oh  brother  brother  will she soon awaken be       i would that she laugh with me       she sleeps  and the world so full of sound       she s deaf  like the deaths that are under the ground       that i laugh and laugh to see       now shall i tell how the black earl heeded not the story of the little  brother  nor the tragedy that lay therein  for his ear was busy with  another sound      hush   said the black earl   for hearest thou not a voice in trouble       nay   cried the little brother   i hear naught save the laughing stream  that comes from the lake where my water nymph lieth       hush   said the black earl again   for hearest thou not the voice of my  mistress making a lamentation       nay   saith the little brother   i hear naught save the moving of the  reeds in the pushing waters  and thou wilt not listen to my story      now went the little brother away in his anger  and found himself a play  among the heather     but the black earl bent above the stream and gazed long into its shallow  turbulence with wonder and fear  for the words the stream said to him in  its whisperings were as though spoken in the voice of his young bride     he laid his hand in the flowing waters      why art thou troubled  little stream   quoth he     but the little stream stayed not its whispering      sainted mother  oh  pray for me   it murmured  in piteous prayer   and  leave sweet mercy upon my soul      now  when the black earl heard the voice of his lady coming from the  waters in such sorrow  he rose with a cry  and  his heart being full of  fear  he knew at last the greatness of his love      where art thou  then   he cried  in his woe   whither shall i seek thee      but the little stream passing his feet murmured its prayer in going  no  other sound did he hear save the far away laughter of his little brother      oh  mary  mother  pray my soul to rest  take mercy  lord  on a soul  afraid       where are the lips from which thou hast stolen that cry   said the black  earl  and  like an old man bent with trouble  he sought the banks  seeking  for the white form of his bride   now   quoth he   well do i know this  stream hath carried her last cry to my feet  and her drowning lips have  been forced to sinful death to night by my long cruelty      he went up the hill as a man goeth to despair  slow and afraid  and when  he reached the little wood in whose bosom the lake was enshrined  he  paused and looked around     of this shall i sing  for so sad and piteous it is that my harp would fain  soothe me from tears         he looked into the deep wood green         but nothing there did see       he looked into the still water        beneath  all white  lay she          he drew her from her cold  cold bed         and kissed her cheek and chin       loosed from his neck his silken cloak         to wrap her body in          he took her up in his two arms          his grief was deep and wild       he knelt beside her on the sod         and sorrowed like a child          he blew three blasts upon his horn         his men did make reply       and came all quickly to his call         through brake and brier so high          and every man who saw her there        went down upon his knee       behind her came earl roderick         all pitiful to see          and in his trembling hand the helm        from his uncovered brow       and  oh   he said   to love her well         and know it only now           so he did walk while she did ride        through all the town away       for greater than earl roderick        she did become that day      now have i said how the heart of the black earl woke to love  and then was  humbled  as the ancient crone had foretold  but of his sorrowful years   his desperate danger of eternal loss and his after salvation  must i  likewise tell  if the story would be pitiful in the ending     therefore shall i lay my harp aside  and so go back in my telling     and i bid thee remember how the little pale bride was wont to sit upon the  mountain and watch the far lights in her father s home quench themselves  one by one     so now of how she died shall i tell thee  and of what came to her in her  passing  lest thou thinkest so innocent a child had laid violent hands  upon her life  who only had met death through the breaking of her heart     here sat she on the mountain  and the wild things spoke of her in her  silence  the red weasel  the bee  and the bramble  and many others  moved  to watch her  well have they known her in her young joyfulness  here had  she made the place she loved best  the high brow of the hill where she sat  as a child and watched  on the one side the far off city and the white  towers that held the wonder knight of her dreams  here had she sat and  seen the gleam of his spear as he went with his hunters through the  valley  and here  too  had her mother come to tell her of her betrothal   so she had nigh fainted in her happiness  in looking upon the white tower  that was to be her home     here had she learned the sweet language of the birds and flowers  and  they  too  had partaken of her joys  but of her sorrows they would not  understand  for our joys and our laughter  are they not as the singing of  the bird and the dancing of the fly  who weep only when they meet death   in our griefs do we not stand alone  who have in our hearts the fierce  desires of love and all the tragedies of despair     now  as the young bride turned her slow feet up the mountain  down where  her glad feet had turned as a maid  she sat her there by the lake     the little creatures she was wont to love and understand gathered about  her and wondered at her state      she hath returned   said the red weasel   see where she sitteth  her head  upon her hand  i slew a young bird at her feet  and she spake no word  nor  did she care       it is not she   said a linnet  swaying on a safe spray   for had it been  she her anger would have slain thee       it is she   said the red weasel  laughing in his throat   but her eyes  are hidden by her fingers  and she cannot see       it is not she   said a brown wren   her cheek was full and rosy and her  song loud  this one sitteth all mute and pale       it is she   said the red weasel   who sitteth upon the mountain  her face  hidden between her hands  she sitteth in silence  and who can tell her  thoughts  she hath been to the great city       it is a small place   hummed a honey bee   once  long ago  she raised her  white palm between her eyes and its smoke   see   she laughed   my little  hand can cover it        it is so great   said the red weasel   that those who leave the mountains  for love of it return to us no more       yet she hath returned   said a lone lark hanging in the sky   and i  myself have sung beside her ear       she came  yet she came not   said the red weasel   what did she answer  when thou saidst that i had slain thy mate       she sighed   thou singest a gay song  o bird    hummed a golden beetle    my grief  that she cannot understand       she is lost to us indeed   said a honeysuckle swaying in the wind   for  she trod me beneath her feet when i held my sweet blossoms for her lips       and she tore me aside   cried the wild bramble   when i did but reach  towards her for embrace       she will know thee no more   said the red weasel   she hath been to the  great city       she laid her lips upon me ere she went   spake the wild bramble   and  said she would return to us soon       she bid me ring a merry chime   whispered the heather   and i move my  many bells now for her welcome  but she will not hear       she will speak with thee no more   said the red weasel   she hath walked  in the city  like one goeth upon the fairy sleeping grass  and her soul  hath forgotten us       she is still and cold   said a shining fly glancing through the air   i  have danced a measure under her eyes  and she did not see       she is dead   said the honey bee   for when she would not look upon me as  before  i drew my sword and stung her sharply  but she did not stir  she  sat and gazed into the distance where the smoke like a great gray web  lieth heavy  she is surely dead       she is not dead   said the red weasel   she hath been to the great city       maybe there she hath found death   said the shining fly   for his web  reacheth far  and he loveth the dark places and hidden ways  he hideth   too  in the cool arbors of the wood  stretching a gray chain for our  undoing  maybe she found death  he spreadeth ropes of pearls across our  path  and looketh upon us from the shade  when the dance is gayest he  creepeth to spring  maybe she hath reached for the pearls or hath danced  into his net      and so the fly sang of the watcher in the wood  and his song i shall sing  thee  lest thou grow weary of my prose         deep in the wood s recesses cool        i see the fairy dancers glide       in cloth of gold  in gown of green         my lord and lady side by side          but who has hung from leaf to leaf         from flower to flower  a silken twine       a cloud of gray that holds the dew        in globes of clear enchanted wine          or stretches far from branch to branch         from thorn to thorn  in diamond rain       who caught the cup of crystal wine        and hung so fair the shining chain          tis death the spider  in his net         who lures the dancers as they glide       in cloth of gold  in gown of green         my lord and lady side by side      but a dragon fly rattling his armor said  without heed of the singer   she  is dead   for when she came among the heather the joyous spirit of the  mountain met her and blew upon her hair and eyes  he kissed her worn cheek  that he had known so fair  and the soft rain of his sorrow fell to see the  pity of her brow  she passed all stiff and cold  she did not hear nor  understand      wind   quoth she   blow not so fierce       she is not dead   saith the red weasel   she hath been to the great  city      now  when the young bride raised her white face from her hands and looked  about her  she could neither hear the speaking of the birds nor see the  beauty of the wild flowers  yet in her heart she had a memory of both   turning to the little flying things that came about her with soft  beating  wings  she said      once ye spake to me  and could give comfort with your counsel and love   now ye are lost in the voices of the city that ring forever in my ears      gazing upon the flowers  she said      ye  too  your beauty hath faded  the gaudy flowers of the city have  flashed their color in my eyes  so ye i cannot see or understand      then she rose to her feet  though she scarce could stand  and  stretching  her arms towards the great purple hills that surrounded her father s far  home  she said towards it      why didst thou call me back since thou hast let me go from the sight of  the heights that would have been always a prayer to uplift my soul  ahone   that thy voice was loud enough to follow and give me unrest  that  whispered always of my father s house and the valley of my home  so must i  come each eve upon this hill to look upon it from my loneliness      unloved am i  and unwished for  by him whom i have wedded  so my heart  dieth within my breast  and my soul trembleth on the brink of my grave      here upon the mountains  unprayed for and uncoffined  shall my body lie   for thy voice hath called me forth      here my black sins shall see and pursue me even to destruction  but in  the city i could have escaped with the crowding souls that confuse death  to count      then  as a remembrance of her sins came heavy upon her  she gave a loud  cry and covered her face with her hands     so she stood without help upon the mountains  and because she was blind  with the city dust and deafened with its cries  she stood alone  the  pitying wild flowers blew their fragrance to her eyes  but they would not  open  the gentle birds spoke comforting whispers to her ears  but she  could not hear  the great hills held their arms about her and breathed  their peace upon her brow  but this she did not know  and so stood alone  to face death     first turned she her face to where her father s castle stood on a far  hill  and again turned she to see the white towers where she had lived and  loved so vainly  and when her eyes met the glisten of the walls  her heart  broke with a little sigh  and she fell upon the ground  and she laid her  weary body down beside the waters of the mountain lake  her head with its  loosened hair lay in the waters  so her lips  covered by the murmuring  ripples  breathed a prayer as she died for her passing soul  and the  little stream that ran from the lake down the hill side carried the prayer  upon its breast as thou hast been told     now  when the ghost of the little bride stood upright beside her fallen  body  she was sore afraid  and trembled much to leave the habitation she  had known in life     she laid her spirit hands upon the cold dead  and clung to it as though  she would not be driven forth  many and terrifying were the sights that  met her when she opened her eyes  after passing through the change of  death  many and terrifying were the sounds that came to her ears  and she  feared she would be whirled away with the great clouds that passed her and  went like smoke into the skies  cold she was and drenched with the rain  that fell everywhere around her  gray and misshapen were the moving masses  under her gaze  and only where her hands lay holding to her dead body did  she see aught of the world she had left behind  there the sweet green  grass lifted itself and a brier rose cast its blossom apart  there a bee  sang  calling to her a little comfort among all the strange sounds that  filled her ears     as she listened  she found the noises that troubled her were the cries of  many voices  and as she began to see more clearly in the great change that  had come to her  she knew the shadowy clouds rushing upward were the  spirits of the dead on their dangerous swift way to heaven  and as she  raised her face to follow their flight the rain fell salt into her mouth   so she knew it was the repentant tears of the passing ghosts     so crouched she in that misty world  seeing not the green earth and the  purple hills  but only the whirling shapes about her on every side  flying  from earth to heaven  pursued by their black sins     and one in the valley of baile ata cliat  looking towards the mountains   said      see how the clouds fly black and fearful   but it was the hosts of  spirits flying upward   see   quoth he   how the lightning flashes   but  it was the opening of god s high paradise to receive some spirit wellnigh  spent   hark   said he   how the wind moans and the rain beats upon the  window   but it was the cry of the passing ghosts and their falling tears  as their black sins fought and kept them from heaven     but one who was a singer took his harp and sang  for he understood  here  is his song         they say it is the wind in midnight skies         loud shrieking past the window  that doth make      each casement shudder with its storm of cries         and the barred door with pushing shoulder shake          ah no  ah no  it is the souls pass by         their lot to run from earth to god s high place       pursued by each black sin that death let fly        from their sad flesh  to break them in the chase          they say it is the rain from leaf to leaf        doth slip and roll into the thirsting ground       that where the corn is trampled sheaf by sheaf        the heavy sorrow of the storm is found          ah no  ah no  it is repentant tears         by those let fall who make their direful flight       and drop by drop the anguish of their fears        comes down around us all the awful night          they say that in the lightning flash  and roar        of clashing clouds  the tempest is about       and draw their chairs the glowing hearth before         and casement close to shut the danger out          ah no  the doors of paradise they swing        a moment open for a soul nigh spent       then come together till the thunder s ring        leaves us half blinded by god s element      now  the spirit of the young bride was not yet called upon to join their  terrible flight  for until her body was laid beneath the clay the soul had  power to stay beside it  so stayed the spirit of the young bride by her  dead body till her ghostly eyes grew accustomed to the change which had  come to her  and when she found she could see the brown earth again and  the things thereon  she rose to her feet  and ran down the mountains to  the castle of black roderick  and there called thrice beside the gate  and  for her it was opened by the little brother  who gazed affrighted and ran  from her      what hath come to thee   quoth she  and came upon him in his fear     and he looked not to her  but spake to a knight at arms  saying thus      three times cried the voice of my brother s wife at the gates  and when i  opened for her there was none outside      so the little bride  hearing  cried out in her despair  for she had  forgotten that she was no longer as these others     and when the two heard the cry  they were affrighted  and made the cross  upon their foreheads      it is the banshee   quoth the knight   who weeps for some death      seeing they feared her  the little bride passed sadly into the castle  and  timidly sought the chamber where the black earl was gone to crouch by the  glowing fire     now  when black roderick looked up and saw her  he sprang towards her so  she was afraid  and flitted before him like a shadow  and when he followed  up the stair and into his own chamber  she faded like a shadow in the  sunshine that came through the window  and the wind  coming down from the  mountains and passing through the casement  drew her out upon its breast   and bore her back to the hills where her body lay awaiting its burial     and seeing it there  a misery fell upon her  so she raised her head and  wept      ahone   quoth she   poor body that hath no one to weep over thy  loneliness  that must lie uncoffined and unprayed for  who wast so  tenderly cared for in thy life  where art thou  my father  where art thou   my mother  that this should be  and where is he to whom this poor body was  given to cherish and to love      and again she went to the castle of black roderick  and stood beside his  door  the tears undried upon her cheek  and again sprang he towards her   so she was afraid  and flew before him down the winding stair and out into  the night  so he could no longer see her     and again the spirit of the young bride went back to the dead upon the  hill side  and  seeing it unburied and uncoffined  fell into tears      never   saith she   shall i now reach heaven  if my body lieth without a  grave      and so sad was her soul at the thought that she went in her despair to the  castle of the black earl  and stood again upon his threshold full of  tears     and when he looked up and saw her he was no longer fierce  but spake to  her gently      come hither   quoth he   my sad faced bride  i would but ask thee one  question  come beside my chair      but she answered him not at all  but withdrew from his presence  as though  bidding him follow     out into the night he followed  and pursued her without rest  till she  almost reached the high hill where her body lay uncoffined     and when they came in the morning to the little grove upon the side of the  mountain  she felt a hand touch the poor  unmourned for dead  and  with a  great fear upon her  vanished from his eyes  so he fell upon the moss in  his disappointment and weariness     but the spirit of the little bride flew to the side of her uncoffined body  to protect it from desecration ere her lord had looked upon it  and there  she saw the little brother playing by the dead     and as she came he turned and ran down the mountain  for he had heard the  voice of black roderick calling  so the spirit of the little bride knew  her task was done  and of how the black earl found her  and of what he  said and did  have i told thee  but of how the spirit of the young bride  enwrapped herself about the dead i have not spoken  nor of how she  thrilled beneath the embraces of her lord  whose love she had at the last     when he stood beside her deep grave  that was dug in the little church yard  nigh to the castle  her spirit rose again from her body  and knew her hour  of trial had come     and when the grave was closed and the mourners gone  the spirit stayed by  the grave  afraid     when evening came  the spirits of the dead rose in a white mist  each  above his grave  and all prepared for their swift and dangerous flight  towards the dark heavens      now   saith she   my body can no longer protect me with its earthly  presence  i am separated from the world  and am no more of it  i must  arise and meet death alone      the first thing she knew of the great presence was a loud whirring of  wings  she raised her head  and saw around her a crowd of evil birds  so  afraid was she that she gave a loud and sudden cry  and at the sound the  ill birds rose and hovered in the air between her and heaven      my sins have discovered me   she cried   and now i fear death      and because she knew that before dawn she would have to account for her  evil deeds  she lifted up her voice in loud keening  so sad was her cry  that the pitying wind bore it down upon his wings into the little village  at the foot of the mountain  that the people might hear and pray for a  soul in its passing     but the people in the village were busy even so late with the harvest  and  did not hear  only in one house where a mother sat with her sick child did  the cry come  and she closed the shutter and fell to prayer       tis the banshee who crieth   she whispered   and my conneen so ill   tis  the banshee  and sheila with the cheek of snow  god bid the fairy pass   and set the angels at my door  whisht   she cried to the playing young  ones   come beside my chair and pray      and of her fear shall i sing  lest thou grow weary of my prose         oh  whisht  i hear the banshee keen         all woful is her cry       she comes along the gray boreen          pray god she pass us by          my wee conneen is pale and weak         i hold him to my side       the rose is white on sheila s cheek        since her young lover died          the little children from their play        creep to me full of fear       oh  whisht  the banshee comes   they say         whom does she weep for here           but sheila leaves my chair to go         and flings the shutter wide       be it for me   she whispers low         the banshee keened and cried           god be between our house and harm         for trouble comes full fleet       i hold the babe close in my arm         the fairy in the street      but the wind that blew from the hill side carried the keening of the  little bride past the village  and blew it about the windows of the castle  wherein black roderick dwelt  and as the cry keened and called  so did the  sleepers turn in their beds and moan uneasily in their dreaming     when the cry passed the windows of the east  it went to the windows of the  west  and there it tapped softly with fingers of the wind and called three  times      roderick  roderick  roderick      and at the first call black roderick turned in his bed and groaned  and at  the second call he rose from his couch and said  in his anger      who calleth  and will not let me rest      but at the third call he rose and went to the window in wonder  and seeing  nothing he crept cold and trembling to his bed  muttering the  half forgotten prayers of his childhood  so long he lay in fear and  amazement that he did not sleep till the lark hung singing in the heavens   and then he knew the night was gone and with it the ghosts that hide in  the darkness  so he turned his face to the wall and slept  but the spirit  of the little bride was speeding on her swift and terrible race to  paradise  and round her whirled three great black birds seeking for her  destruction  and as she flew  one caught her by the long hair that swept  behind her in the wind and drew her backward      now   quoth she with a cry   i can fly upward no longer  some evil thing  draws me back from heaven      and as she spoke a voice came out of the dark skies  and said      who holdeth back the passing soul      and the voice of the dark bird replied      her anger  for she hath not submitted to her trials  but held herself  rebellious  therefore do i draw her down      and the voice from high paradise called out  saying      is there none to come to her succor  lest she be brought to her  destruction      and a bee humming on the hillside  hearing the voice  flew upward and  stung the evil bird so it fell away into the darkness and was seen no  more     and the voice from the heavens cried again  saying      who hath let the little soul go free      and the bee answered      her gentleness  for she loveth all things  great and small  and hath fed  the honey bee when the earth refused him its sweets      now  as the spirit of the little bride flew upward  freed from the grasp  of the evil bird  there came upon her again the cruel claws of one of  those two others that circled round her  holding her back upon her way      now   quoth she   i shall never see the kingdom of heaven  and cannot  reach the doors of paradise   and bitter exceedingly was her crying     but again a voice came from the dark night  saying      who holdeth back the coming soul from her place in heaven      and the black  evil bird answered      her despair  for she hath not held her head high above her sorrows  nor  hath borne in patience her griefs  but hath mourned the afflictions that  were put upon her till her heart hath broken under her grief  therefore do  i draw her down      and the voice from high paradise called out  saying      is there none  then  to save her from eternal destruction      and a wild bramble upon the mountain  hearing the voice  lifted itself  upward  and  throwing a long spray about the evil bird  tore it so with  its thorns that it loosed its claws from the wrist of the young bride and  flew into the gloom     and the voice from the heavens cried again  saying      who hath let the soul go free      and the bramble answered  wafting the perfume of her flowers upward      her sweetness  for her mind is beautiful as the song of the linnet  and  she turneth her foot aside to spare the lowly blossoms      now  when once more the spirit of the little bride flew upward  the last  and greatest of the evil birds fell upon her  and so strong was he and so  evil that she had no strength to go farther      now   quoth she   i am lost forever  and shall see not the fair place in  paradise that was prepared for me   and she gave a loud and despairing  cry  but a voice came again from the night  and saith      what evil thing keepeth the flying soul upon its way      and the dark bird answered      her jealousy  for bitter was her heart against one whom black roderick  had loved ere she became his bride  and for this do i drag her down to her  destruction      and the voice from the high heavens spoke  saying      is there none  then  to save her      and there looked up from the hillside the bright eyes of the red weasel   but he crouched in the grasses without reply  and the grasp of the evil  bird became stronger on the quivering soul that could no longer fly upon  its way to heaven  and from the great wings of the bird black feathers   wrenched out in the struggle  flew down upon the earth  spreading evil  where they fell     and the voice from heaven cried out again in sorrow exceedingly      is there none  then  to save this soul from destruction      and the bee and the bramble  seeing the red weasel was loath to stir from  the grasses where he sat watching the desperate battle  fell upon him in  their fury and forced him to rise      never   quoth they   shalt thou have rest  nor thy children s children  peace  while there s a bee in the air or a flower upon the thorn  if thou  goest not to the succor of her we love so well      then the red weasel sprang into the air and seized the evil bird by the  throat  so he let go his hold on the spirit of the young bride and flew  away into the darkness     and the voice from heaven cried out  saying      who hath let the frail ghost free to enter the gates of paradise      and the red weasel answered      her strength  for she hath conquered her own evil thoughts  and put them  away forever      so the spirit of the young bride reached the gates of paradise spent and  wounded  and there upon the threshold stood an angel holding his hand to  draw her in     when his holy touch fell upon her  she rose whole and beautiful  and her  breast was full of joy for the moment     now  the spirit of the young bride had been but a brief day in the golden  place of paradise  when she heard a far voice call upon her name in  anguish  three times did it call upon her  and at each cry a sharp sorrow  struck her heart  as though a knife had entered therein     now went she to the golden bar of heaven  and  leaning forth  looked down  upon the earth  and she turned her north  and naught did she see save the  cold face of the night with its millions of worlds whirling in the dark   and she looked south  and naught could she see but the gray of clouds  heavy with storm  and she turned her east  and naught did she see save the  shimmering blue of a summer sky  but when she turned her westward  she saw  the green earth  and of all upon it she sought none save black roderick   who had used her so ill  and there upon his bed he lay in danger of death   and as he turned in his anguish he called ever upon her name  so her heart  knew no longer the peace of paradise  and she became as one of the lost     therefore did she rise up and approach the throne where the saints and  angels knelt in continual devotion  but she could not see the golden seat   nor him who sat thereon  for around and above  and circling ever with  rainbow wings  went the seraphim and cherubim in eternal worship  so it  was as though a great wheel of light turned continually     now  when the spirit of the little bride saw this wonder  she was full of  fear and dared not approach  but turned away weeping  and there  as she  wept  she saw before her the seat of mary  the queen of heaven  and ran  towards it with unfaltering feet      for   quoth she   she  too  had but one love  and  being woman  will  understand      so she knelt at the feet of mary  and cried to her   pray for me  mother  of christ   and the virgin turned to her in wonder at her tears      art thou not happy   said she   in heaven      and the spirit of the little bride said   nay  for the cries of my beloved  come upward from the earth and call to me in his anguish  so i fear he is  in danger of death       and why doth thou fear death for him   said the virgin mary   since it  may bring to him the happiness of heaven       alas   said the little bride   were it thus  his cries would not hurt my  heart so that i cannot hear the song of the angels  i fear he is lost  forever       and what canst thou do  little soul   said the blessed mary   to save him  if he cannot save himself       i can be with him in his destruction      now  as the little soul said this terrible thing she fell forward upon her  face  so afraid was she and so despairing      i can stand between him and the flames   said she   and hold my hand  beneath the burning waters that would fall upon his body      and then she lay silent     then the virgin looked upon her with eyes that were all pitiful and had  much understanding      thou wilt suffer   saith she  as though remembering something   to walk  by his side and see his anguish  but thou wouldst suffer more wert thou  forbidden this      so mary rose from her high place and went towards the high throne of  heaven  and as she passed the whirling wings of the seraphim and cherubim  ceased to circle  but flew towards her from the throne  and to the little  bride  who crouched afraid on the fragrant floor  it seemed as though a  great wonder of bees had settled on some hidden sweet  countless wings  glistened and flashed in the strange light that glowed from the opening  flowers that formed the floor about the throne     in and out  striking together in their eagerness to get nearer their  desire  went the countless wings of the angel hosts     and from the throne all the time there came forth a low singing like the  humming of bees  as the little bride listened there came to her ears the  voice of the virgin praying for her before the throne of god  and in the  pauses of the prayer the countless voices of the fluttering seraphim and  cherubim took up the refrain   hear us  o christ      now suddenly all sound ceased  and the fluttering wings moved aside  and  from their midst strode out a mighty angel of the lord  and when he came  upon the frightened soul of the little bride he took her by the hand  and   leading her to the gates of heaven  opened them that she might go forth     but ere she could pass out he said  with great sadness      thy little hands and feet are soft with the fragrant places of heaven   much wilt thou suffer if thou goest forth      and again he said      how canst thou leave the beauty and love of paradise  wherein thou mayst  enter no more save thou art strong enough to conquer great dangers      but the little soul listened not to him  but passed through the gates in  eager hurry  and as she went the angel followed her with his gaze  and so  great was his pity  for he thought she might not re enter the kingdom of  heaven  that tears fell from his eyes upon her hand  now  when the little  bride went forth from the gates of heaven a chill wind blew upon her  so  she wellnigh fell upon the earth in anguish  but she took the two tears  that had fallen from the angel s eyes and hid them in her heart  and she  became warm  and the sharp earth did not hurt her feet  nor did the wind  of the cold world harm her     now  when the spirit of the little bride came to the gates of the castle  wherein dwelt black roderick  she saw the great changes that had come to  pass therein  for the day that had fallen to her in paradise was as seven  years on earth     with her death had come strife and disunion among the clans  and now at  the walls stood the soldiers of her father  and within on his death bed  the black earl who was dying  a prisoner in their hands     and as the little bride came to the gates of the garden without the  courtyard  she saw before them a strange and horrible coach  and the only  light that came from this dark carriage was from the red eyes of the six  horses who drew it  and their trappings swept the ground  black and  mouldy  now  the body of this coach was shaped like a coffin  and at the  head sat the driver     when the little bride gazed upon him in wonder who he could be  she saw  through the misty winding sheet that enfolded him a death s head  but when  she looked at him who sat at the foot of the coffin  she hid her face  for  it was an evil creature who crouched here     now  as the little bride paused at the gate of the garden a voice came  from inside  and said      wherefore comest thou      and he who sat at the foot of the coffin answered      open  for i claim the soul of black roderick      and the voice that was within answered      thou shalt come  for his cruelty hath driven my young daughter to her  grave  wherein she lieth while the birds sing  and the flowers blossom   and the earth is glad with youth and spring      so he dropped the bolt and the door swung open  so the coach and its six  horses entered     now  when the driver reached the door of the court yard  he found it  closed against him  and he drew his coach up beside it and called in a  hollow voice for entrance     and one cried from inside      wherefore comest thou      and he who was inside answered      i claim the soul of black roderick      and the voice replied      willingly do i open  for he hath slain my sweet sister with his chill  heart and cruel ways  so she lieth in the dark earth who was the sunshine  of our house      then the door swung open so the black coach and its six horses could  enter     again the strange coach drove on  till it came to the castle door  and  there the evil being who was inside cast himself upon the ground  and   going to the door  knocked thereon three times  and a woman s voice  answered  saying      who art thou      and the evil one replied      i am he who claims the soul of black roderick      and the woman said      welcome thou art  then  for he hath destroyed my heart s treasure and  buried it in the ground  so i go sorrowing all my days for the suffering  he caused her on earth  and for her young and unready death      then the bolts and the bars fell from the door with a great noise  and the  evil thing entered the castle     now  as black roderick lay upon his death bed tossing and turning in his  fever  there rushed unto him one of the serving men in a great terror and  fear     and of what they spoke together shall i sing thee  lest thou grow weary of  my prose         there is one at the door  o my master         at the door  who is bidding you come       who is he that wakes me in the darkness         calling when all the world s dumb          six horses has he to his carriage         six horses blacker than the night       and their twelve red eyes in the shadows        twelve lamps he carries for his light          and his coach is a coffin black and mouldy         a huge oak coffin open wide       he asks for your soul  god have mercy         who is calling at the door outside          who let him through the gates of my garden         where stronger bolts have never been       twas the father of the fair little lady        you drove to her grave so green          and who let him pass through the court yard         by loosening the bar and chain       oh  who but the brother of your mistress        who lies in the cold and the rain          then who drew the bolts at the portal        and into my house bade him go       she  the mother of the poor little colleen        who lies in her youth so low          who stands that he dare not enter        the door of my chamber between       oh  the ghost of the fair little lady        who lies in the church yard green      now  when the evil one saw the spirit of the young bride at the door  her  arms spread out in the form of a cross  he did not know what to do  and  had not black roderick  in his joy and desire  sprung from his bed on  hearing the voice of his mistress bidding him fear not  all perchance had  gone well     but roderick  sick and eager for the sight of his bride  flung open the  door  and was seized by the evil one and carried away  now  the spirit of  the little bride followed the horrible coach that contained her love  even  to the flaming gates of hell  and there the evil one stopped and looked  upon her with desire      better   quoth he   a thousand times to let go this wretched fellow  who  will surely return to me later  if i can gain this soul who hath come even  out of the kingdom of heaven      and  turning to the poor little bride  he said   give thou thyself to me   and i will let this love of thine return to the world to work out his  redemption      but the little soul  weeping  saith      nay  my soul belongeth to christ in heaven  and i must not give it to  thee  but for seven years shall i be thy slave if thou givest this dear  one to me at the end      so the evil one thought to himself   would i could steal this white soul  from heaven to be the greatest gem in my crown of triumph  and to serve me  seven years  at the end of that time her heart will incline to evil  and  she will become mine      and again she spoke to him  and of what she said i shall sing thee  lest  thou grow weary of my prose         if you will let his young soul go free         i will serve you true and well       for seven long years to be your slave        in the bitterest place of hell          seven long years if you be my slave        i will let his soul go free        the stranger drew her then by the hand         and into the night went he          seven long years did she serve him true        by the blazing gates of hell       and on every soul that entered in        the tears of her sorrow fell          seven long years did she keep the place        to open the doors accurst       and every soul that her tear drops knew         it would neither burn nor thirst          and once she let in her father dear         and once her brother through       once came a friend she had loved full well         oh  bitter it was to do      now  no toil in the great halls of the evil one could have been more  bitter to endure than to unbar the door for the lost souls  for her sweet  tenderness was tortured most of all by the despairing ghosts that passed  to their eternal perdition  and her hands felt guilty at letting them go  through     but of all the sorrows none was so great as for her eyes to see the  tortures of black roderick  who stood beside her in his anguish  for the  tears that fell upon him from her eyes gave him no relief  since he had  injured her on earth  she held her hands to hold the fiery waters that  fell upon him  and her tender body strove to stand between him and his  tortures in vain  seeing her so endeavoring  the evil one spoke  saying      what hast thou about thee  little soul  that thou art free from my fire  and torments      then the little bride remembered the tears she had hidden in her heart   that had fallen upon her in heaven from the angel s eyes  and she drew  them forth     and the tears spoke to her  saying      put us not away  lest the torments overpower thee  so thou mayst never  come to the kingdom of heaven      but the little bride lifted them upon the heart and mouth of black  roderick  so he suffered no more the cruel tortures of the lost  now  when  the evil one saw this  he smiled to himself   for   quoth he   now will  she know temptations  since she hath put away the angel s tears  and hath  no protection save her own strength      and so bitter were her sufferings that the little bride cried out it was  more than she could bear     and the evil one  hearing her  said      give thyself to me  and thou shalt suffer no more      but she turned her face away  and made him no answer     then black roderick  looking upon her  saw her anguish  and to his soul  came such bitter repentance that great tears fell from his eyes upon her   and every tear was as balm upon her sad and suffering flesh  so that when  the seven years were over she stood whole and without pain     now  when the seven long years were at an end  she found the naming doors  opened of themselves for her and black roderick to go forth  but when she  took her love by the hand  a great cry rose from the lost souls she had  let into the burning place during her seven years of trial  and in her  heart was such grief she could not go  she heard her father s voice call  to her  and the voice of her brother  therefore went she to the throne of  the evil one  and begged him to grant her a boon      for i have worked long for thee and well   quoth she   and i beg of thee  to let me carry forth as much treasure as my strength can bear       that   saith he   thou shalt have  all thou canst carry thou mayst take  forth  if thou wilt give me for payment seven more years of service      now  when the little bride heard this she bowed her head and wept      seven long years   saith she   shall i serve thee more   she took black  roderick by the hand  and stood by him at the open doors   go thou  upward   saith she   and await me in heaven      then she closed the flaming gates  and took her place behind them  but the  soul of black roderick crouched outside  as a dog lieth on the threshold  of his master  for seven long years he let no one approach the naming  gates  so that not once were they opened during the last seven years of  her trial  and when the day came for her to go forth  the little bride  flung the gates apart with a loud cry of joy  she knew the evil one could  but grant the promise she had extorted  for she had served him well     and of the further trials and temptations that came to her shall i sing  thee  lest thou grow weary of my prose         seven long years did she serve him well        until the last day was done       and all the souls she had let in         they clung to her one by one          and all the souls she had let through         they clung to her dress and hair       until the burden that she brought forth        was heavy as she could bear          the first who stopped upon her way        was a saint all fair to see       and  sister  your load is great   she said         so give it  i pray  to me           brigit i am  god sent me forth        that you to your love might go         the woman she drew the fair robe aside         and a cloven hoof did show          and i will not give it to you   she said         quick grasping her burden tight       and all the souls that surrounded her        clung closer in dire affright          the next who stopped her upon her way        was an angel with sword aflame       the lord has sent for your load   he said         st  michael it is my name           the woman drew back his gown of white         and the cloven hoof did see       oh  god be with me this day   she said         for bitter my sorrows be           and i will not give it to you   she said         and wept full many a tear       and all the souls that her burden made        cried out in desperate fear      now  the spirit of the poor little bride stopped upon her way  and feared  to go farther  for she knew not what to do nor where to go  and it seemed  as though there were none to trust  and as she stood  with the trembling  souls clinging to her  from the far off earth came the sweet singing of a  robin  and as the bird sang he came nearer and nearer  till the little  bride could see his red throat pulsing with his song  and the song he bore  upon his beak was her mother s prayer     now  when the soul of the little bride heard this sweet singing  she  became strong  and followed the bird even to the gates of heaven  and  there she paused  trembling  afraid to knock  for she had gone forth of  her own free will  and she had returned with a burden that she had no  leave to bring      and without these dear ones how could i enter   saith she  and the souls  trembled with her in her fear     but the robin tapped upon the golden gates three times with his beak  and  flung his song into the shining blue of the skies     then a voice came forth  saying      by what right comest thou  of all birds  to disturb the peace of paradise  with thy singing      and the robin answered      because i alone  of all birds  strove to draw forth the cruel nails in  calvary  so my breast is ever red with the sacred blood       and what song bearest thou upon thy bill   saith the voice   that would  be welcome here       the prayer of a mother for the soul of her little child   quoth the  robin     when he saith this the doors of paradise were opened  and upon the  threshold stood one of the archangels of the lord  and his face was glad  and glorious as the sun  and when he saw the little bride  with her burden  of trembling souls clinging to her dress and hair  he bade her enter      thou hast done well   saith he   and there is joy in heaven over thy  return      and as he led her by the hand the souls dropped from her and flew through  the golden gates with loud cries of joy     so brought she to heaven the soul of black roderick  that had been lost  but for her great and suffering love  and from the closed gates none came  forth save the little robin     now must i end my tale  lest thou grow weary of the telling     and if more thou requirest  listen thou to the robin  who alone of all  birds hath seen the glories of paradise  and who telleth to all men  if  they would but hear  his pride and his joy  even in winter  when snow and  hunger chill him almost to death  when all other birds are silent with  discontent  he sitteth upon a low bough and telleth the story of black  roderick and his little bride  and of many things good to the heart of  man  listen thou and hearken       the end                      to italy goes from munich across the tyrol  through  innsbruck and bozen to verona  over the mountains  here the great  processions passed as the emperors went south  or came home again from  rosy italy to their own germany     and how much has that old imperial vanity clung to the german soul  did  not the german kings inherit the empire of bygone rome  it was not a  very real empire  perhaps  but the sound was high and splendid     maybe a certain groessenwahn is inherent in the german nature  if only  nations would realize that they have certain natural characteristics  if  only they could understand and agree to each other s particular nature   how much simpler it would all be     the imperial procession no longer crosses the mountains  going south   that is almost forgotten  the road has almost passed out of mind  but  still it is there  and its signs are standing     the crucifixes are there  not mere attributes of the road  yet still  having something to do with it  the imperial processions  blessed by the  pope and accompanied by the great bishops  must have planted the holy  idol like a new plant among the mountains  there where it multiplied and  grew according to the soil  and the race that received it     as one goes among the bavarian uplands and foothills  soon one realizes  here is another land  a strange religion  it is a strange country   remote  out of contact  perhaps it belongs to the forgotten  imperial  processions     coming along the clear  open roads that lead to the mountains  one  scarcely notices the crucifixes and the shrines  perhaps one s interest  is dead  the crucifix itself is nothing  a factory made piece of  sentimentalism  the soul ignores it     but gradually  one after another looming shadowily under their hoods   the crucifixes seem to create a new atmosphere over the whole of the  countryside  a darkness  a weight in the air that is so unnaturally  bright and rare with the reflection from the snows above  a darkness  hovering just over the earth  so rare and unearthly the light is  from  the mountains  full of strange radiance  then every now and again recurs  the crucifix  at the turning of an open  grassy road  holding a shadow  and a mystery under its pointed hood     i was startled into consciousness one evening  going alone over a marshy  place at the foot of the mountains  when the sky was pale and unearthly   invisible  and the hills were nearly black  at a meeting of the tracks  was a crucifix  and between the feet of the christ a handful of withered  poppies  it was the poppies i saw  then the christ     it was an old shrine  the wood sculpture of a bavarian peasant  the  christ was a peasant of the foot of the alps  he had broad cheekbones  and sturdy limbs  his plain  rudimentary face stared fixedly at the  hills  his neck was stiffened  as if in resistance to the fact of the  nails and the cross  which he could not escape  it was a man nailed down  in spirit  but set stubbornly against the bondage and the disgrace  he  was a man of middle age  plain  crude  with some of the meanness of the  peasant  but also with a kind of dogged nobility that does not yield its  soul to the circumstance  plain  almost blank in his soul  the  middle aged peasant of the crucifix resisted unmoving the misery of his  position  he did not yield  his soul was set  his will was fixed  he was  himself  let his circumstances be what they would  his life fixed down     across the marsh was a tiny square of orange coloured light  from the  farm house with the low  spreading roof  i remembered how the man and  his wife and the children worked on till dark  silent and intent   carrying the hay in their arms out of the streaming thunder rain into  the shed  working silent in the soaking rain     the body bent forward towards the earth  closing round on itself  the  arms clasped full of hay  clasped round the hay that presses soft and  close to the breast and the body  that pricks heat into the arms and the  skin of the breast  and fills the lungs with the sleepy scent of dried  herbs  the rain that falls heavily and wets the shoulders  so that the  shirt clings to the hot  firm skin and the rain comes with heavy   pleasant coldness on the active flesh  running in a trickle down towards  the loins  secretly  this is the peasant  this hot welter of physical  sensation  and it is all intoxicating  it is intoxicating almost like a  soporific  like a sensuous drug  to gather the burden to one s body in  the rain  to stumble across the living grass to the shed  to relieve  one s arms of the weight  to throw down the hay on to the heap  to feel  light and free in the dry shed  then to return again into the chill   hard rain  to stoop again under the rain  and rise to return again with  the burden     it is this  this endless heat and rousedness of physical sensation which  keeps the body full and potent  and flushes the mind with a blood heat   a blood sleep  and this sleep  this heat of physical experience  becomes  at length a bondage  at last a crucifixion  it is the life and the  fulfilment of the peasant  this flow of sensuous experience  but at last  it drives him almost mad  because he cannot escape     for overhead there is always the strange radiance of the mountains   there is the mystery of the icy river rushing through its pink shoals  into the darkness of the pine woods  there is always the faint tang of  ice on the air  and the rush of hoarse sounding water     and the ice and the upper radiance of snow are brilliant with timeless  immunity from the flux and the warmth of life  overhead they transcend  all life  all the soft  moist fire of the blood  so that a man must  needs live under the radiance of his own negation     there is a strange  clear beauty of form about the men of the bavarian  highlands  about both men and women  they are large and clear and  handsome in form  with blue eyes very keen  the pupil small  tightened   the iris keen  like sharp light shining on blue ice  their large   full moulded limbs and erect bodies are distinct  separate  as if they  were perfectly chiselled out of the stuff of life  static  cut off   where they are everything is set back  as in a clear frosty air     their beauty is almost this  this strange  clean cut isolation  as if  each one of them would isolate himself still further and for ever from  the rest of his fellows     yet they are convivial  they are almost the only race with the souls of  artists  still they act the mystery plays with instinctive fullness of  interpretation  they sing strangely in the mountain fields  they love  make belief and mummery  their processions and religious festivals are  profoundly impressive  solemn  and rapt     it is a race that moves on the poles of mystic sensual delight  every  gesture is a gesture from the blood  every expression is a symbolic  utterance     for learning there is sensuous experience  for thought there is myth and  drama and dancing and singing  everything is of the blood  of the  senses  there is no mind  the mind is a suffusion of physical heat  it  is not separated  it is kept submerged     at the same time  always  overhead  there is the eternal  negative  radiance of the snows  beneath is life  the hot jet of the blood playing  elaborately  but above is the radiance of changeless not being  and life  passes away into this changeless radiance  summer and the prolific  blue and white flowering of the earth goes by  with the labour and the  ecstasy of man  disappears  and is gone into brilliance that hovers  overhead  the radiant cold which waits to receive back again all that  which has passed for the moment into being     the issue is too much revealed  it leaves the peasant no choice  the  fate gleams transcendent above him  the brightness of eternal   unthinkable not being  and this our life  this admixture of labour and  of warm experience in the flesh  all the time it is steaming up to the  changeless brilliance above  the light of the everlasting snows  this is  the eternal issue     whether it is singing or dancing or play acting or physical transport of  love  or vengeance or cruelty  or whether it is work or sorrow or  religion  the issue is always the same at last  into the radiant  negation of eternity  hence the beauty and completeness  the finality of  the highland peasant  his figure  his limbs  his face  his motion  it is  all formed in beauty  and it is all completed  there is no flux nor hope  nor becoming  all is  once and for all  the issue is eternal  timeless   and changeless  all being and all passing away is part of the issue   which is eternal and changeless  therefore there is no becoming and no  passing away  everything is  now and for ever  hence the strange beauty  and finality and isolation of the bavarian peasant     it is plain in the crucifixes  here is the essence rendered in sculpture  of wood  the face is blank and stiff  almost expressionless  one  realizes with a start how unchanging and conventionalized is the face of  the living man and woman of these parts  handsome  but motionless as  pure form  there is also an underlying meanness  secretive  cruel  it is  all part of the beauty  the pure  plastic beauty  the body also of the  christus is stiff and conventionalized  yet curiously beautiful in  proportion  and in the static tension which makes it unified into one  clear thing  there is no movement  no possible movement  the being is  fixed  finally  the whole body is locked in one knowledge  beautiful   complete  it is one with the nails  not that it is languishing or dead   it is stubborn  knowing its own undeniable being  sure of the absolute  reality of the sensuous experience  though he is nailed down upon an  irrevocable fate  yet  within that fate he has the power and the delight  of all sensuous experience  so he accepts the fate and the mystic  delight of the senses with one will  he is complete and final  his  sensuous experience is supreme  a consummation of life and death  at once     it is the same at all times  whether it is moving with the scythe on the  hill slopes  or hewing the timber  or steering the raft down the river  which is all effervescent with ice  whether it is drinking in the  gasthaus  or making love  or playing some mummer s part  or hating  steadily and cruelly  or whether it is kneeling in spellbound subjection  in the incense filled church  or walking in the strange  dark   subject procession to bless the fields  or cutting the young birch trees  for the feast of frohenleichnam  it is always the same  the dark   powerful mystic  sensuous experience is the whole of him  he is mindless  and bound within the absoluteness of the issue  the unchangeability of  the great icy not being which holds good for ever  and is supreme     passing further away  towards austria  travelling up the isar  till the  stream becomes smaller and whiter and the air is colder  the full  glamour of the northern hills  which are so marvellously luminous and  gleaming with flowers  wanes and gives way to a darkness  a sense of  ominousness  up there i saw another little christ  who seemed the very  soul of the place  the road went beside the river  that was seething  with snowy ice bubbles  under the rocks and the high  wolf like  pine trees  between the pinkish shoals  the air was cold and hard and  high  everything was cold and separate  and in a little glass case  beside the road sat a small  hewn christ  the head resting on the hand   and he meditates  half wearily  doggedly  the eyebrows lifted in strange  abstraction  the elbow resting on the knee  detached  he sits and dreams  and broods  wearing his little golden crown of thorns  and his little  cloak of red flannel that some peasant woman has stitched for him     no doubt he still sits there  the small  blank faced christ in the cloak  of red flannel  dreaming  brooding  enduring  persisting  there is a  wistfulness about him  as if he knew that the whole of things was too  much for him  there was no solution  either  in death  death did not  give the answer to the soul s anxiety  that which is  is  it does not  cease to be when it is cut  death cannot create nor destroy  what  is  is     the little brooding christ knows this  what is he brooding  then  his  static patience and endurance is wistful  what is it that he secretly  yearns for  amid all the placidity of fate   to be  or not to be   this  may be the question  but is it not a question for death to answer  it is  not a question of living or not living  it is a question of being  to be  or not to be  to persist or not to persist  that is not the question   neither is it to endure or not to endure  the issue  is it eternal  not being  if not  what  then  is being  for overhead the eternal  radiance of the snow gleams unfailing  it receives the efflorescence of  all life and is unchanged  the issue is bright and immortal  the snowy  not being  what  then  is being     as one draws nearer to the turning point of the alps  towards the  culmination and the southern slope  the influence of the educated world  is felt once more  bavaria is remote in spirit  as yet unattached  its  crucifixes are old and grey and abstract  small like the kernel of the  truth  further into austria they become new  they are painted white   they are larger  more obtrusive  they are the expressions of a later   newer phase  more introspective and self conscious  but still they are  genuine expressions of the people s soul     often one can distinguish the work of a particular artist here and there  in a district  in the zemm valley  in the heart of the tyrol  behind  innsbruck  there are five or six crucifixes by one sculptor  he is no  longer a peasant working out an idea  conveying a dogma  he is an  artist  trained and conscious  probably working in vienna  he is  consciously trying to convey a  feeling   he is no longer striving  awkwardly to render a truth  a religious fact     the chief of his crucifixes stands deep in the klamm  in the dank gorge  where it is always half night  the road runs under the rock and the  trees  half way up the one side of the pass  below  the stream rushes  ceaselessly  embroiled among great stones  making an endless loud noise   the rock face opposite rises high overhead  with the sky far up  so that  one is walking in a half night  an underworld  and just below the path   where the pack horses go climbing to the remote  infolded villages  in  the cold gloom of the pass hangs the large  pale christ  he is larger  than life size  he has fallen forward  just dead  and the weight of the  full grown  mature body hangs on the nails of the hands  so the dead   heavy body drops forward  sags  as if it would tear away and fall under  its own weight     it is the end  the face is barren with a dead expression of weariness   and brutalized with pain and bitterness  the rather ugly  passionate  mouth is set for ever in the disillusionment of death  death is the  complete disillusionment  set like a seal over the whole body and being   over the suffering and weariness and the bodily passion     the pass is gloomy and damp  the water roars unceasingly  till it is  almost like a constant pain  the driver of the pack horses  as he comes  up the narrow path in the side of the gorge  cringes his sturdy  cheerfulness as if to obliterate himself  drawing near to the large   pale christ  and he takes his hat off as he passes  though he does not  look up  but keeps his face averted from the crucifix  he hurries by in  the gloom  climbing the steep path after his horses  and the large white  christ hangs extended above     the driver of the pack horses is afraid  the fear is always there in  him  in spite of his sturdy  healthy robustness  his soul is not sturdy   it is blenched and whitened with fear  the mountains are dark overhead   the water roars in the gloom below  his heart is ground between the  mill stones of dread  when he passes the extended body of the dead  christ he takes off his hat to the lord of death  christ is the deathly  one  he is death incarnate     and the driver of the pack horses acknowledges this deathly christ as  supreme lord  the mountain peasant seems grounded upon fear  the fear of  death  of physical death  beyond this he knows nothing  his supreme  sensation is in physical pain  and in its culmination  his great climax   his consummation  is death  therefore he worships it  bows down before  it  and is fascinated by it all the while  it is his fulfilment  death   and his approach to fulfilment is through physical pain     and so these monuments to physical death are found everywhere in the  valleys  by the same hand that carved the big christ  a little further  on  at the end of a bridge  was another crucifix  a small one  this  christ had a fair beard  and was thin  and his body was hanging almost  lightly  whereas the other christ was large and dark and handsome  but  in this  as well as in the other  was the same neutral triumph of death   complete  negative death  so complete as to be abstract  beyond cynicism  in its completeness of leaving off     everywhere is the same obsession with the fact of physical pain   accident  and sudden death  wherever a misfortune has befallen a man   there is nailed up a little memorial of the event  in propitiation of  the god of hurt and death  a man is standing up to his waist in water   drowning in full stream  his arms in the air  the little painting in its  wooden frame is nailed to the tree  the spot is sacred to the accident   again  another little crude picture fastened to a rock  a tree  falling  on a man s leg  smashes it like a stalk  while the blood flies up   always there is the strange ejaculation of anguish and fear  perpetuated  in the little paintings nailed up in the place of the disaster     this is the worship  then  the worship of death and the approaches to  death  physical violence  and pain  there is something crude and  sinister about it  almost like depravity  a form of reverting  turning  back along the course of blood by which we have come     turning the ridge on the great road to the south  the imperial road to  rome  a decisive change takes place  the christs have been taking on  various different characters  all of them more or less realistically  conveyed  one christus is very elegant  combed and brushed and foppish  on his cross  as gabriele d annunzio s son posing as a martyred saint   the martyrdom of this christ is according to the most polite convention   the elegance is very important  and very austrian  one might almost  imagine the young man had taken up this striking and original position  to create a delightful sensation among the ladies  it is quite in the  viennese spirit  there is something brave and keen in it  too  the  individual pride of body triumphs over every difficulty in the  situation  the pride and satisfaction in the clean  elegant form  the  perfectly trimmed hair  the exquisite bearing  are more important than  the fact of death or pain  this may be foolish  it is at the same time  admirable     but the tendency of the crucifix  as it nears the ridge to the south  is  to become weak and sentimental  the carved christs turn up their faces  and roll back their eyes very piteously  in the approved guido reni  fashion  they are overdoing the pathetic turn  they are looking to  heaven and thinking about themselves  in self commiseration  others  again are beautiful as elegies  it is dead hyacinth lifted and extended  to view  in all his beautiful  dead youth  the young  male body droops  forward on the cross  like a dead flower  it looks as if its only true  nature were to be dead  how lovely is death  how poignant  real   satisfying  it is the true elegiac spirit     then there are the ordinary  factory made christs  which are not very  significant  they are as null as the christs we see represented in  england  just vulgar nothingness  but these figures have gashes of red   a red paint of blood  which is sensational     beyond the brenner  i have only seen vulgar or sensational crucifixes   there are great gashes on the breast and the knees of the christ figure   and the scarlet flows out and trickles down  till the crucified body has  become a ghastly striped thing of red and white  just a sickly thing of  striped red     they paint the rocks at the corners of the tracks  among the mountains   a blue and white ring for the road to ginzling  a red smear for the way  to st jakob  so one follows the blue and white ring  or the three  stripes of blue and white  or the red smear  as the case may be  and the  red on the rocks  the dabs of red paint  are of just the same colour as  the red upon the crucifixes  so that the red upon the crucifixes is  paint  and the signs on the rocks are sensational  like blood     i remember the little brooding christ of the isar  in his little cloak  of red flannel and his crown of gilded thorns  and he remains real and  dear to me  among all this violence of representation       couvre toi de gloire  tartarin  couvre toi de flanelle    why should  it please me so that his cloak is of red flannel     in a valley near st jakob  just over the ridge  a long way from the  railway  there is a very big  important shrine by the roadside  it is a  chapel built in the baroque manner  florid pink and cream outside  with  opulent small arches  and inside is the most startling sensational  christus i have ever seen  he is a big  powerful man  seated after the  crucifixion  perhaps after the resurrection  sitting by the grave  he  sits sideways  as if the extremity were over  finished  the agitation  done with  only the result of the experience remaining  there is some  blood on his powerful  naked  defeated body  that sits rather hulked   but it is the face which is so terrifying  it is slightly turned over  the hulked  crucified shoulder  to look  and the look of this face  of  which the body has been killed  is beyond all expectation horrible  the  eyes look at one  yet have no seeing in them  they seem to see only  their own blood  for they are bloodshot till the whites are scarlet  the  iris is purpled  these red  bloody eyes with their stained pupils   glancing awfully at all who enter the shrine  looking as if to see  through the blood of the late brutal death  are terrible  the naked   strong body has known death  and sits in utter dejection  finished   hulked  a weight of shame  and what remains of life is in the face   whose expression is sinister and gruesome  like that of an unrelenting  criminal violated by torture  the criminal look of misery and hatred on  the fixed  violated face and in the bloodshot eyes is almost impossible   he is conquered  beaten  broken  his body is a mass of torture  an  unthinkable shame  yet his will remains obstinate and ugly  integral  with utter hatred     it is a great shock to find this figure sitting in a handsome  baroque   pink washed shrine in one of those alpine valleys which to our thinking  are all flowers and romance  like the picture in the tate gallery    spring in the austrian tyrol  is to our minds a vision of pristine  loveliness  it contains also this christ of the heavy body defiled by  torture and death  the strong  virile life overcome by physical  violence  the eyes still looking back bloodshot in consummate hate  and misery     the shrine was well kept and evidently much used  it was hung with  ex voto limbs and with many gifts  it was a centre of worship  of a sort  of almost obscene worship  afterwards the black pine trees and the river  of that valley seemed unclean  as if an unclean spirit lived there  the  very flowers seemed unnatural  and the white gleam on the mountain tops  was a glisten of supreme  cynical horror     after this  in the populous valleys  all the crucifixes were more or  less tainted and vulgar  only high up  where the crucifix becomes  smaller and smaller  is there left any of the old beauty and religion   higher and higher  the monument becomes smaller and smaller  till in the  snows it stands out like a post  or a thick arrow stuck barb upwards   the crucifix itself is a small thing under the pointed hood  the barb of  the arrow  the snow blows under the tiny shed  upon the little  exposed  christ  all round is the solid whiteness of snow  the awful curves and  concaves of pure whiteness of the mountain top  the hollow whiteness  between the peaks  where the path crosses the high  extreme ridge of the  pass  and here stands the last crucifix  half buried  small and tufted  with snow  the guides tramp slowly  heavily past  not observing the  presence of the symbol  making no salute  further down  every mountain  peasant lifted his hat  but the guide tramps by without concern  his is  a professional importance now     on a small mountain track on the jaufen  not far from meran  was a  fallen christus  i was hurrying downhill to escape from an icy wind  which almost took away my consciousness  and i was looking up at the  gleaming  unchanging snow peaks all round  they seemed like blades  immortal in the sky  so i almost ran into a very old martertafel  it  leaned on the cold  stony hillside surrounded by the white peaks in the  upper air     the wooden hood was silver grey with age  and covered  on the top  with  a thicket of lichen  which stuck up in hoary tufts  but on the rock at  the foot of the post was the fallen christ  armless  who had tumbled  down and lay in an unnatural posture  the naked  ancient wooden  sculpture of the body on the naked  living rock  it was one of the old  uncouth christs hewn out of bare wood  having the long  wedge shaped  limbs and thin flat legs that are significant of the true spirit  the  desire to convey a religious truth  not a sensational experience     the arms of the fallen christ had broken off at the shoulders  and they  hung on their nails  as ex voto limbs hang in the shrines  but these  arms dangled from the palms  one at each end of the cross  the muscles   carved sparely in the old wood  looking all wrong  upside down  and the  icy wind blew them backwards and forwards  so that they gave a painful  impression  there in the stark  sterile place of rock and cold  yet i  dared not touch the fallen body of the christ  that lay on its back in  so grotesque a posture at the foot of the post  i wondered who would  come and take the broken thing away  and for what purpose            on the lago di garda                the spinner and the monks      the holy spirit is a dove  or an eagle  in the old testament it was an  eagle  in the new testament it is a dove     and there are  standing over the christian world  the churches of the  dove and the churches of the eagle  there are  moreover  the churches  which do not belong to the holy spirit at all  but which are built to  pure fancy and logic  such as the wren churches in london     the churches of the dove are shy and hidden  they nestle among trees   and their bells sound in the mellowness of sunday  or they are gathered  into a silence of their own in the very midst of the town  so that one  passes them by without observing them  they are as if invisible   offering no resistance to the storming of the traffic     but the churches of the eagle stand high  with their heads to the skies   as if they challenged the world below  they are the churches of the  spirit of david  and their bells ring passionately  imperiously  falling  on the subservient world below     the church of san francesco was a church of the dove  i passed it  several times in the dark  silent little square  without knowing it was  a church  its pink walls were blind  windowless  unnoticeable  it gave  no sign  unless one caught sight of the tan curtain hanging in the door   and the slit of darkness beneath  yet it was the chief church of  the village     but the church of san tommaso perched over the village  coming down the  cobbled  submerged street  many a time i looked up between the houses  and saw the thin old church standing above in the light  as if it  perched on the house roofs  its thin grey neck was held up stiffly   beyond was a vision of dark foliage  and the high hillside     i saw it often  and yet for a long time it never occurred to me that it  actually existed  it was like a vision  a thing one does not expect to  come close to  it was there standing away upon the house tops  against a  glamour of foliaged hillside  i was submerged in the village  on the  uneven  cobbled street  between old high walls and cavernous shops and  the houses with flights of steps     for a long time i knew how the day went  by the imperious clangour of  midday and evening bells striking down upon the houses and the edge of  the lake  yet it did not occur to me to ask where these bells rang  till  at last my everyday trance was broken in upon  and i knew the ringing of  the church of san tommaso  the church became a living connexion with me     so i set out to find it  i wanted to go to it  it was very near  i could  see it from the piazza by the lake  and the village itself had only a  few hundreds of inhabitants  the church must be within a stone s throw     yet i could not find it  i went out of the back door of the house  into  the narrow gully of the back street  women glanced down at me from the  top of the flights of steps  old men stood  half turning  half crouching  under the dark shadow of the walls  to stare  it was as if the strange  creatures of the under shadow were looking at me  i was of  another element     the italian people are called  children of the sun   they might better  be called  children of the shadow   their souls are dark and nocturnal   if they are to be easy  they must be able to hide  to be hidden in lairs  and caves of darkness  going through these tiny chaotic backways of the  village was like venturing through the labyrinth made by furtive  creatures  who watched from out of another element  and i was pale  and  clear  and evanescent  like the light  and they were dark  and close   and constant  like the shadow     so i was quite baffled by the tortuous  tiny  deep passages of the  village  i could not find my way  i hurried towards the broken end of a  street  where the sunshine and the olive trees looked like a mirage  before me  and there above me i saw the thin  stiff neck of old san  tommaso  grey and pale in the sun  yet i could not get up to the church   i found myself again on the piazza     another day  however  i found a broken staircase  where weeds grew in  the gaps the steps had made in falling  and maidenhair hung on the  darker side of the wall  i went up unwillingly  because the italians  used this old staircase as a privy  as they will any deep side passage     but i ran up the broken stairway  and came out suddenly  as by a  miracle  clean on the platform of my san tommaso  in the  tremendous sunshine     it was another world  the world of the eagle  the world of fierce  abstraction  it was all clear  overwhelming sunshine  a platform hung in  the light  just below were the confused  tiled roofs of the village  and  beyond them the pale blue water  down below  and opposite  opposite my  face and breast  the clear  luminous snow of the mountain across the  lake  level with me apparently  though really much above     i was in the skies now  looking down from my square terrace of cobbled  pavement  that was worn like the threshold of the ancient church  round  the terrace ran a low  broad wall  the coping of the upper heaven where  i had climbed     there was a blood red sail like a butterfly breathing down on the blue  water  whilst the earth on the near side gave off a green silver smoke  of olive trees  coming up and around the earth coloured roofs     it always remains to me that san tommaso and its terrace hang suspended  above the village  like the lowest step of heaven  of jacob s ladder   behind  the land rises in a high sweep  but the terrace of san tommaso  is let down from heaven  and does not touch the earth     i went into the church  it was very dark  and impregnated with centuries  of incense  it affected me like the lair of some enormous creature  my  senses were roused  they sprang awake in the hot  spiced darkness  my  skin was expectant  as if it expected some contact  some embrace  as if  it were aware of the contiguity of the physical world  the physical  contact with the darkness and the heavy  suggestive substance of the  enclosure  it was a thick  fierce darkness of the senses  but my  soul shrank     i went out again  the pavemented threshold was clear as a jewel  the  marvellous clarity of sunshine that becomes blue in the height seemed to  distil me into itself     across  the heavy mountain crouched along the side of the lake  the  upper half brilliantly white  belonging to the sky  the lower half dark  and grim  so  then  that is where heaven and earth are divided  from  behind me  on the left  the headland swept down out of a great   pale grey  arid height  through a rush of russet and crimson  to the  olive smoke and the water of the level earth  and between  like a blade  of the sky cleaving the earth asunder  went the pale blue lake  cleaving  mountain from mountain with the triumph of the sky     then i noticed that a big  blue checked cloth was spread on the parapet  before me  over the parapet of heaven  i wondered why it hung there     turning round  on the other side of the terrace  under a caper bush that  hung like a blood stain from the grey wall above her  stood a little  grey woman whose fingers were busy  like the grey church  she made me  feel as if i were not in existence  i was wandering by the parapet of  heaven  looking down  but she stood back against the solid wall  under  the caper bush  unobserved and unobserving  she was like a fragment of  earth  she was a living stone of the terrace  sun bleached  she took no  notice of me  who was hesitating looking down at the earth beneath  she  stood back under the sun bleached solid wall  like a stone rolled down  and stayed in a crevice     her head was tied in a dark red kerchief  but pieces of hair  like dirty  snow  quite short  stuck out over her ears  and she was spinning  i  wondered so much  that i could not cross towards her  she was grey  and  her apron  and her dress  and her kerchief  and her hands and her face  were all sun bleached and sun stained  greyey  bluey  browny  like  stones and half coloured leaves  sunny in their colourlessness  in my  black coat  i felt myself wrong  false  an outsider     she was spinning  spontaneously  like a little wind  under her arm she  held a distaff of dark  ripe wood  just a straight stick with a clutch  at the end  like a grasp of brown fingers full of a fluff of blackish   rusty fleece  held up near her shoulder  and her fingers were plucking  spontaneously at the strands of wool drawn down from it  and hanging  near her feet  spinning round upon a black thread  spinning busily  like  a thing in a gay wind  was her shuttle  her bobbin wound fat with the  coarse  blackish worsted she was making     all the time  like motion without thought  her fingers teased out the  fleece  drawing it down to a fairly uniform thickness  brown  old   natural fingers that worked as in a sleep  the thumb having a long grey  nail  and from moment to moment there was a quick  downward rub  between  thumb and forefinger  of the thread that hung in front of her apron  the  heavy bobbin spun more briskly  and she felt again at the fleece as she  drew it down  and she gave a twist to the thread that issued  and the  bobbin spun swiftly     her eyes were clear as the sky  blue  empyrean  transcendent  they were  dear  but they had no looking in them  her face was like a  sun worn stone      you are spinning   i said to her     her eyes glanced over me  making no effort of attention      yes   she said     she saw merely a man s figure  a stranger standing near  i was a bit of  the outside  negligible  she remained as she was  clear and sustained  like an old stone upon the hillside  she stood short and sturdy  looking  for the most part straight in front  unseeing  but glancing from time to  time  with a little  unconscious attention  at the thread  she was  slightly more animated than the sunshine and the stone and the  motionless caper bush above her  still her fingers went along the strand  of fleece near her breast      that is an old way of spinning   i said      what      she looked up at me with eyes clear and transcendent as the heavens  but  she was slightly roused  there was the slight motion of the eagle in her  turning to look at me  a faint gleam of rapt light in her eyes  it was  my unaccustomed italian      that is an old way of spinning   i repeated      yes  an old way   she repeated  as if to say the words so that they  should be natural to her  and i became to her merely a transient  circumstance  a man  part of the surroundings  we divided the gift of  speech  that was all     she glanced at me again  with her wonderful  unchanging eyes  that were  like the visible heavens  unthinking  or like two flowers that are open  in pure clear unconsciousness  to her i was a piece of the environment   that was all  her world was clear and absolute  without consciousness of  self  she was not self conscious  because she was not aware that there  was anything in the universe except  her  universe  in her universe i  was a stranger  a foreign  signore   that i had a world of my own  other  than her own  was not conceived by her  she did not care     so we conceive the stars  we are told that they are other worlds  but  the stars are the clustered and single gleaming lights in the night sky  of our world  when i come home at night  there are the stars  when i  cease to exist as the microcosm  when i begin to think of the cosmos   then the stars are other worlds  then the macrocosm absorbs me  but the  macrocosm is not me  it is something which i  the microcosm  am not     so that there is something which is unknown to me and which nevertheless  exists  i am finite  and my understanding has limits  the universe is  bigger than i shall ever see  in mind or spirit  there is that which  is not me     if i say  the planet mars is inhabited   i do not know what i mean by   inhabited   with reference to the planet mars  i can only mean that  that world is not my world  i can only know there is that which is not  me  i am the microcosm  but the macrocosm is that also which i am not     the old woman on the terrace in the sun did not know this  she was  herself the core and centre to the world  the sun  and the single  firmament  she knew that i was an inhabitant of lands which she had  never seen  but what of that  there were parts of her own body which she  had never seen  which physiologically she could never see  they were  none the less her own because she had never seen them  the lands she had  not seen were corporate parts of her own living body  the knowledge she  had not attained was only the hidden knowledge of her own self  she   was  the substance of the knowledge  whether she had the knowledge in  her mind or not  there was nothing which was not herself  ultimately   even the man  the male  was part of herself  he was the mobile  separate  part  but he was none the less herself because he was sometimes severed  from her  if every apple in the world were cut in two  the apple would  not be changed  the reality is the apple  which is just the same in the  half apple as in the whole     and she  the old spinning woman  was the apple  eternal  unchangeable   whole even in her partiality  it was this which gave the wonderful clear  unconsciousness to her eyes  how could she be conscious of herself when  all was herself     she was talking to me of a sheep that had died  but i could not  understand because of her dialect  it never occurred to her that i could  not understand  she only thought me different  stupid  and she talked  on  the ewes had lived under the house  and a part was divided off for  the he goat  because the other people brought their she goats to be  covered by the he goat  but how the ewe came to die i could not  make out     her fingers worked away all the time in a little  half fretful movement   yet spontaneous as butterflies leaping here and there  she chattered  rapidly on in her italian that i could not understand  looking meanwhile  into my face  because the story roused her somewhat  yet not a feature  moved  her eyes remained candid and open and unconscious as the skies   only a sharp will in them now and then seemed to gleam at me  as if to  dominate me     her shuttle had caught in a dead chicory plant  and spun no more  she  did not notice  i stooped and broke off the twigs  there was a glint of  blue on them yet  seeing what i was doing  she merely withdrew a few  inches from the plant  her bobbin hung free     she went on with her tale  looking at me wonderfully  she seemed like  the creation  like the beginning of the world  the first morning  her  eyes were like the first morning of the world  so ageless     her thread broke  she seemed to take no notice  but mechanically picked  up the shuttle  wound up a length of worsted  connected the ends from  her wool strand  set the bobbin spinning again  and went on talking  in  her half intimate  half unconscious fashion  as if she were talking to  her own world in me     so she stood in the sunshine on the little platform  old and yet like  the morning  erect and solitary  sun coloured  sun discoloured  whilst i  at her elbow  like a piece of night and moonshine  stood smiling into  her eyes  afraid lest she should deny me existence     which she did  she had stopped talking  did not look at me any more  but  went on with her spinning  the brown shuttle twisting gaily  so she  stood  belonging to the sunshine and the weather  taking no more notice  of me than of the dark stained caper bush which hung from the wall above  her head  whilst i  waiting at her side  was like the moon in the  daytime sky  overshone  obliterated  in spite of my black clothes      how long has it taken you to do that much   i asked     she waited a minute  glanced at her bobbin      this much  i don t know  a day or two       but you do it quickly      she looked at me  as if suspiciously and derisively  then  quite  suddenly  she started forward and went across the terrace to the great  blue and white checked cloth that was drying on the wall  i hesitated   she had cut off her consciousness from me  so i turned and ran away   taking the steps two at a time  to get away from her  in a moment i was  between the walls  climbing upwards  hidden     the schoolmistress had told me i should find snowdrops behind san  tommaso  if she had not asserted such confident knowledge i should have  doubted her translation of  perce neige   she meant christmas roses all  the while     however  i went looking for snowdrops  the walls broke down suddenly   and i was out in a grassy olive orchard  following a track beside pieces  of fallen overgrown masonry  so i came to skirt the brink of a steep  little gorge  at the bottom of which a stream was rushing down its steep  slant to the lake  here i stood to look for my snowdrops  the grassy   rocky bank went down steep from my feet  i heard water tittle tattling  away in deep shadow below  there were pale flecks in the dimness  but  these  i knew  were primroses  so i scrambled down     looking up  out of the heavy shadow that lay in the cleft  i could see   right in the sky  grey rocks shining transcendent in the pure empyrean    are they so far up   i thought  i did not dare to say   am i so far  down   but i was uneasy  nevertheless it was a lovely place  in the cold  shadow  complete  when one forgot the shining rocks far above  it was a  complete  shadowless world of shadow  primroses were everywhere in nests  of pale bloom upon the dark  steep face of the cleft  and tongues of  fern hanging out  and here and there under the rods and twigs of bushes  were tufts of wrecked christmas roses  nearly over  but still  in the  coldest corners  the lovely buds like handfuls of snow  there had been  such crowded sumptuous tufts of christmas roses everywhere in the  stream gullies  during the shadow of winter  that these few remaining  flowers were hardly noticeable     i gathered instead the primroses  that smelled of earth and of the  weather  there were no snowdrops  i had found the day before a bank of  crocuses  pale  fragile  lilac coloured flowers with dark veins   pricking up keenly like myriad little lilac coloured flames among the  grass  under the olive trees  and i wanted very much to find the  snowdrops hanging in the gloom  but there were not any     i gathered a handful of primroses  then i climbed suddenly  quickly out  of the deep watercourse  anxious to get back to the sunshine before the  evening fell  up above i saw the olive trees in the sunny golden grass   and sunlit grey rocks immensely high up  i was afraid lest the evening  would fall whilst i was groping about like an otter in the damp and the  darkness  that the day of sunshine would be over     soon i was up in the sunshine again  on the turf under the olive trees   reassured  it was the upper world of glowing light  and i was  safe again     all the olives were gathered  and the mills were going night and day   making a great  acrid scent of olive oil in preparation  by the lake   the little stream rattled down  a mule driver  hued   to his mules on  the strada vecchia  high up  on the strada nuova  the beautiful  new   military high road  which winds with beautiful curves up the  mountain side  crossing the same stream several times in clear leaping  bridges  travelling cut out of sheer slope high above the lake  winding  beautifully and gracefully forward to the austrian frontier  where it  ends  high up on the lovely swinging road  in the strong evening  sunshine  i saw a bullock wagon moving like a vision  though the  clanking of the wagon and the crack of the bullock whip responded close  in my ears     everything was clear and sun coloured up there  clear grey rocks  partaking of the sky  tawny grass and scrub  browny green spires of  cypresses  and then the mist of grey green olives fuming down to the  lake side  there was no shadow  only clear sun substance built up to the  sky  a bullock wagon moving slowly in the high sunlight  along the  uppermost terrace of the military road  it sat in the warm stillness of  the transcendent afternoon     the four o clock steamer was creeping down the lake from the austrian  end  creeping under the cliffs  far away  the verona side  beyond the  island  lay fused in dim gold  the mountain opposite was so still  that  my heart seemed to fade in its beating as if it too would be still  all  was perfectly still  pure substance  the little steamer on the floor of  the world below  the mules down the road cast no shadow  they too were  pure sun substance travelling on the surface of the sun made world     a cricket hopped near me  then i remembered that it was saturday  afternoon  when a strange suspension comes over the world  and then   just below me  i saw two monks walking in their garden between the  naked  bony vines  walking in their wintry garden of bony vines and  olive trees  their brown cassocks passing between the brown vine stocks   their heads bare to the sunshine  sometimes a glint of light as their  feet strode from under their skirts     it was so still  everything so perfectly suspended  that i felt them  talking  they marched with the peculiar march of monks  a long  loping  stride  their heads together  their skirts swaying slowly  two brown  monks with hidden hands  sliding under the bony vines and beside the  cabbages  their heads always together in hidden converse  it was as if i  were attending with my dark soul to their inaudible undertone  all the  time i sat still in silence  i was one with them  a partaker  though i  could hear no sound of their voices  i went with the long stride of  their skirted feet  that slid springless and noiseless from end to end  of the garden  and back again  their hands were kept down at their  sides  hidden in the long sleeves  and the skirts of their robes  they  did not touch each other  nor gesticulate as they walked  there was no  motion save the long  furtive stride and the heads leaning together  yet  there was an eagerness in their conversation  almost like  shadow creatures ventured out of their cold  obscure element  they went  backwards and forwards in their wintry garden  thinking nobody could  see them     across  above them  was the faint  rousing dazzle of snow  they never  looked up  but the dazzle of snow began to glow as they walked  the  wonderful  faint  ethereal flush of the long range of snow in the  heavens  at evening  began to kindle  another world was coming to pass   the cold  rare night  it was dawning in exquisite  icy rose upon the  long mountain summit opposite  the monks walked backwards and forwards   talking  in the first undershadow     and i noticed that up above the snow  frail in the bluish sky  a frail  moon had put forth  like a thin  scalloped film of ice floated out on  the slow current of the coming night  and a bell sounded     and still the monks were pacing backwards and forwards  backwards and  forwards  with a strange  neutral regularity     the shadows were coming across everything  because of the mountains in  the west  already the olive wood where i sat was extinguished  this was  the world of the monks  the rim of pallor between night and day  here  they paced  backwards and forwards  backwards and forwards  in the  neutral  shadowless light of shadow     neither the flare of day nor the completeness of night reached them   they paced the narrow path of the twilight  treading in the neutrality  of the law  neither the blood nor the spirit spoke in them  only the  law  the abstraction of the average  the infinite is positive and  negative  but the average is only neutral  and the monks trod backward  and forward down the line of neutrality     meanwhile  on the length of mountain ridge  the snow grew  rosy incandescent  like heaven breaking into blossom  after all  eternal  not being and eternal being are the same  in the rosy snow that shone in  heaven over a darkened earth was the ecstasy of consummation  night and  day are one  light and dark are one  both the same in the origin and in  the issue  both the same in the moment  of ecstasy  light fused in  darkness and darkness fused in light  as in the rosy snow above  the twilight     but in the monks it was not ecstasy  in them it was neutrality  the  under earth  transcendent  above the shadowed  twilit earth was the rosy  snow of ecstasy  but spreading far over us  down below  was the  neutrality of the twilight  of the monks  the flesh neutralizing the  spirit  the spirit neutralizing the flesh  the law of the average  asserted  this was the monks as they paced backward and forward     the moon climbed higher  away from the snowy  fading ridge  she became  gradually herself  between the roots of the olive tree was a rosy tipped  daisy just going to sleep  i gathered it and put it among the frail   moony little bunch of primroses  so that its sleep should warm the rest   also i put in some little periwinkles  that were very blue  reminding me  of the eyes of the old woman     the day was gone  the twilight was gone  and the snow was invisible as i  came down to the side of the lake  only the moon  white and shining  was  in the sky  like a woman glorying in her own loveliness as she loiters  superbly to the gaze of all the world  looking sometimes through the  fringe of dark olive leaves  sometimes looking at her own superb   quivering body  wholly naked in the water of the lake     my little old woman was gone  she  all day sunshine  would have none of  the moon  always she must live like a bird  looking down on all the  world at once  so that it lay all subsidiary to herself  herself the  wakeful consciousness hovering over the world like a hawk  like a sleep  of wakefulness  and  like a bird  she went to sleep as the shadows came     she did not know the yielding up of the senses and the possession of the  unknown  through the senses  which happens under a superb moon  the  all glorious sun knows none of these yieldings up  he takes his way  and  the daisies at once go to sleep  and the soul of the old spinning woman  also closed up at sunset  the rest was a sleep  a cessation     it is all so strange and varied  the dark skinned italians ecstatic in  the night and the moon  the blue eyed old woman ecstatic in the busy  sunshine  the monks in the garden below  who are supposed to unite both   passing only in the neutrality of the average  where  then  is the  meeting point  where in mankind is the ecstasy of light and dark  together  the supreme transcendence of the afterglow  day hovering in  the embrace of the coming night like two angels embracing in the  heavens  like eurydice in the arms of orpheus  or persephone embraced  by pluto     where is the supreme ecstasy in mankind  which makes day a delight and  night a delight  purpose an ecstasy and a concourse in ecstasy  and  single abandon of the single body and soul also an ecstasy under the  moon  where is the transcendent knowledge in our hearts  uniting sun and  darkness  day and night  spirit and senses  why do we not know that the  two in consummation are one  that each is only part  partial and alone  for ever  but that the two in consummation are perfect  beyond the range  of loneliness or solitude                the lemon gardens      the padrone came just as we were drinking coffee after dinner  it was  two o clock  because the steamer going down the lake to desenzano had  bustled through the sunshine  and the rocking of the water still made  lights that danced up and down upon the wall among the shadows by  the piano     the signore was very apologetic  i found him bowing in the hall  cap in  one hand  a slip of paper in the other  protesting eagerly  in broken  french  against disturbing me     he is a little  shrivelled man  with close cropped grey hair on his  skull  and a protruding jaw  which  with his gesticulations  always  makes me think of an ancient  aristocratic monkey  the signore is a  gentleman  and the last  shrivelled representative of his race  his only  outstanding quality  according to the villagers  is his avarice       mais  mais  monsieur  je crains que  que  que je vous derange        he spreads wide his hands and bows  looking up at me with implicit brown  eyes  so ageless in his wrinkled  monkey s face  like onyx  he loves to  speak french  because then he feels grand  he has a queer  naive   ancient passion to be grand  as the remains of an impoverished family   he is not much better than a well to do peasant  but the old spirit is  eager and pathetic in him     he loves to speak french to me  he holds his chin and waits  in his  anxiety for the phrase to come  then it stammers forth  a little rush   ending in italian  but his pride is all on edge  we must continue  in french     the hall is cold  yet he will not come into the large room  this is not  a courtesy visit  he is not here in his quality of gentleman  he is only  an anxious villager       voyez  monsieur  cet  cet  qu est ce que  qu est ce que veut dire  cet  cela       he shows me the paper  it is an old scrap of print  the picture of an  american patent door spring  with directions   fasten the spring either  end up  wind it up  never unwind      it is laconic and american  the signore watches me anxiously  waiting   holding his chin  he is afraid he ought to understand my english  i  stutter off into french  confounded by the laconic phrases of the  directions  nevertheless  i make it clear what the paper says     he cannot believe me  it must say something else as well  he has not  done anything contrary to these directions  he is most distressed       mais  monsieur  la porte  la porte  elle ferme  pas   elle s ouvre        he skipped to the door and showed me the whole tragic mystery  the door   it is shut   ecco   he releases the catch  and pouf   she flies open   she flies  open   it is quite final     the brown  expressionless  ageless eyes  that remind me of a monkey s   or of onyx  wait for me  i feel the responsibility devolve upon me  i  am anxious      allow me   i said   to come and look at the door      i feel uncomfortably like sherlock holmes  the padrone protests   non   monsieur  non  cela vous derange   that he only wanted me to translate  the words  he does not want to disturb me  nevertheless  we go  i feel i  have the honour of mechanical england in my hands     the casa di paoli is quite a splendid place  it is large  pink and  cream  rising up to a square tower in the centre  throwing off a painted  loggia at either extreme of the facade  it stands a little way back from  the road  just above the lake  and grass grows on the bay of cobbled  pavement in front  when at night the moon shines full on this pale  facade  the theatre is far outdone in staginess     the hall is spacious and beautiful  with great glass doors at either  end  through which shine the courtyards where bamboos fray the sunlight  and geraniums glare red  the floor is of soft red tiles  oiled and  polished like glass  the walls are washed grey white  the ceiling is  painted with pink roses and birds  this is half way between the outer  world and the interior world  it partakes of both     the other rooms are dark and ugly  there is no mistake about their being  interior  they are like furnished vaults  the red tiled  polished floor  in the drawing room seems cold and clammy  the carved  cold furniture  stands in its tomb  the air has been darkened and starved to death  it  is perished     outside  the sunshine runs like birds singing  up above  the grey rocks  build the sun substance in heaven  san tommaso guards the terrace  but  inside here is the immemorial shadow     again i had to think of the italian soul  how it is dark  cleaving to  the eternal night  it seems to have become so  at the renaissance  after  the renaissance     in the middle ages christian europe seems to have been striving  out of  a strong  primitive  animal nature  towards the self abnegation and the  abstraction of christ  this brought about by itself a great sense of  completeness  the two halves were joined by the effort towards the one  as yet unrealized  there was a triumphant joy in the whole     but the movement all the time was in one direction  towards the  elimination of the flesh  man wanted more and more to become purely free  and abstract  pure freedom was in pure abstraction  the word was  absolute  when man became as the word  a pure law  then he was free     but when this conclusion was reached  the movement broke  already  botticelli painted aphrodite  queen of the senses  supreme along with  mary  queen of heaven  and michelangelo suddenly turned back on the  whole christian movement  back to the flesh  the flesh was supreme and  god like  in the oneness of the flesh  in the oneness of our physical  being  we are one with god  with the father  god the father created man  in the flesh  in his own image  michelangelo swung right back to the old  mosaic position  christ did not exist  to michelangelo there was no  salvation in the spirit  there was god the father  the begetter  the  author of all flesh  and there was the inexorable law of the flesh  the  last judgement  the fall of the immortal flesh into hell     this has been the italian position ever since  the mind  that is the  light  the senses  they are the darkness  aphrodite  the queen of the  senses  she  born of the sea foam  is the luminousness of the gleaming  senses  the phosphorescence of the sea  the senses become a conscious  aim unto themselves  she is the gleaming darkness  she is the luminous  night  she is goddess of destruction  her white  cold fire consumes and  does not create     this is the soul of the italian since the renaissance  in the sunshine  he basks asleep  gathering up a vintage into his veins which in the  night time he will distil into ecstatic sensual delight  the intense   white cold ecstasy of darkness and moonlight  the raucous  cat like   destructive enjoyment  the senses conscious and crying out in their  consciousness in the pangs of the enjoyment  which has consumed the  southern nation  perhaps all the latin races  since the renaissance     it is a lapse back  back to the original position  the mosaic position   of the divinity of the flesh  and the absoluteness of its laws  but also  there is the aphrodite worship  the flesh  the senses  are now  self conscious  they know their aim  their aim is in supreme sensation   they seek the maximum of sensation  they seek the reduction of the  flesh  the flesh reacting upon itself  to a crisis  an ecstasy  a  phosphorescent transfiguration in ecstasy     the mind  all the time  subserves the senses  as in a cat  there is  subtlety and beauty and the dignity of the darkness  but the fire is  cold  as in the eyes of a cat  it is a green fire  it is fluid   electric  at its maximum it is the white ecstasy of phosphorescence  in  the darkness  always amid the darkness  as under the black fur of a cat   like the feline fire  it is destructive  always consuming and reducing  to the ecstasy of sensation  which is the end in itself     there is the i  always the i  and the mind is submerged  overcome  but  the senses are superbly arrogant  the senses are the absolute  the  god like  for i can never have another man s senses  these are me  my  senses absolutely me  and all that is can only come to me through my  senses  so that all is me  and is administered unto me  the rest  that  is not me  is nothing  it is something which is nothing  so the italian   through centuries  has avoided our northern purposive industry  because  it has seemed to him a form of nothingness     it is the spirit of the tiger  the tiger is the supreme manifestation of  the senses made absolute  this is the        tiger  tiger burning bright       in the forests of the night    of blake  it does indeed burn within the darkness  but the   essential  fate  of the tiger is cold and white  a white ecstasy   it is seen in the white eyes of the blazing cat  this is the supremacy  of the flesh  which devours all  and becomes transfigured into a  magnificent brindled flame  a burning bush indeed     this is one way of transfiguration into the eternal flame  the  transfiguration through ecstasy in the flesh  like the tiger in the  night  i devour all flesh  i drink all blood  until this fuel blazes up  in me to the consummate fire of the infinite  in the ecstacy i am  infinite  i become again the great whole  i am a flame of the one white  flame which is the infinite  the eternal  the originator  the creator   the everlasting god  in the sensual ecstasy  having drunk all blood and  devoured all flesh  i am become again the eternal fire  i am infinite     this is the way of the tiger  the tiger is supreme  his head is  flattened as if there were some great weight on the hard skull   pressing  pressing  pressing the mind into a stone  pressing it down  under the blood  to serve the blood  it is the subjugate instrument of  the blood  the will lies above the loins  as it were at the base of the  spinal column  there is the living will  the living mind of the tiger   there in the slender loins  that is the node  there in the spinal cord     so the italian  so the soldier  this is the spirit of the soldier  he   too  walks with his consciousness concentrated at the base of the spine   his mind subjugated  submerged  the will of the soldier is the will of  the great cats  the will to ecstasy in destruction  in absorbing life  into his own life  always his own life supreme  till the ecstasy burst  into the white  eternal flame  the infinite  the flame of the infinite   then he is satisfied  he has been consummated in the infinite     this is the true soldier  this is the immortal climax of the senses   this is the acme of the flesh  the one superb tiger who has devoured all  living flesh  and now paces backwards and forwards in the cage of its  own infinite  glaring with blind  fierce  absorbed eyes at that which is  nothingness to it     the eyes of the tiger cannot see  except with the light from within  itself  by the light of its own desire  its own white  cold light is so  fierce that the other warm light of day is outshone  it is not  it does  not exist  so the white eyes of the tiger gleam to a point of  concentrated vision  upon that which does not exist  hence its  terrifying sightlessness  the something which i know i am is hollow  space to its vision  offers no resistance to the tiger s looking  it can  only see of me that which it knows i am  a scent  a resistance  a  voluptuous solid  a struggling warm violence that it holds overcome  a  running of hot blood between its jaws  a delicious pang of live flesh in  the mouth  this it sees  the rest is not     and what is the rest  that which is not the tiger  that which the tiger  is not  what is this     what is that which parted ways with the terrific eagle like angel of the  senses at the renaissance  the italians said   we are one in the father   we will go back   the northern races said   we are one in christ  we  will go on      what  is  the consummation in christ  man knows satisfaction when he  surpasses all conditions and becomes  to himself  consummate in the  infinite  when he reaches a state of infinity  in the supreme ecstasy  of the flesh  the dionysic ecstasy  he reaches this state  but how does  it come to pass in christ     it is not the mystic ecstasy  the mystic ecstasy is a special sensual  ecstasy  it is the senses satisfying themselves with a self created  object  it is self projection into the self  the sensuous self satisfied  in a projected self         blessed are the poor in spirit  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven         blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness  sake  for      theirs is the kingdom of heaven     the kingdom of heaven is this infinite into which we may be consummated   then  if we are poor in spirit or persecuted for righteousness  sake         whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek  turn to him the other      also         love your enemies  bless them that curse you  do good to them that      hate you  and pray for them which despitefully use you  and      persecute you         be ye therefore perfect  even as your father which is in heaven is      perfect     to be perfect  to be one with god  to be infinite and eternal  what  shall we do  we must turn the other cheek  and love our enemies     christ is the lamb which the eagle swoops down upon  the dove taken by  the hawk  the deer which the tiger devours     what then  if a man come to me with a sword  to kill me  and i do not  resist him  but suffer his sword and the death from his sword  what am  i  am i greater than he  am i stronger than he  do i know a consummation  in the infinite  i  the prey  beyond the tiger who devours me  by my  non resistance i have robbed him of his consummation  for a tiger knows  no consummation unless he kill a violated and struggling prey  there is  no consummation merely for the butcher  nor for a hyena  i can rob the  tiger of his ecstasy  his consummation  his very   my non resistance  in  my non resistance the tiger is infinitely destroyed     but i  what am i   be ye therefore perfect   wherein am i perfect in  this submission  is there an affirmation  behind my negation  other than  the tiger s affirmation of his own glorious infinity     what is the oneness to which i subscribe  i who offer no resistance in  the flesh     have i only the negative ecstasy of being devoured  of becoming thus  part of the lord  the great moloch  the superb and terrible god  i have  this also  this subject ecstasy of consummation  but is there  nothing else     the word of the tiger is  my senses are supremely me  and my senses are  god in me  but christ said  god is in the others  who are not me  in all  the multitude of the others is god  and this is the great god  greater  than the god which is me  god is that which is not me     and this is the christian truth  a truth complementary to the pagan  affirmation   god is that which is me      god is that which is not me  in realizing the not me i am consummated  i  become infinite  in turning the other cheek i submit to god who is  greater than i am  other than i am  who is in that which is not me  this  is the supreme consummation  to achieve this consummation i love my  neighbour as myself  my neighbour is all that is not me  and if i love  all this  have i not become one with the whole  is not my consummation  complete  am i not one with god  have i not achieved the infinite     after the renaissance the northern races continued forward to put into  practice this religious belief in the god which is not me  even the idea  of the saving of the soul was really negative  it was a question of  escaping damnation  the puritans made the last great attack on the god  who is me  when they beheaded charles the first  the king by divine  right  they destroyed  symbolically  for ever  the supremacy of the me  who am the image of god  the me of the flesh  of the senses  me  the  tiger burning bright  me the king  the lord  the aristocrat  me who am  divine because i am the body of god     after the puritans  we have been gathering data for the god who is  not me  when pope said  know then thyself  presume not god to scan  the  proper study of mankind is man   he was stating the proposition  a man  is right  he is consummated  when he is seeking to know man  the great  abstract  and the method of knowledge is by the analysis  which is the  destruction  of the self  the proposition up to that time was  a man is  the epitome of the universe  he has only to express himself  to fulfil  his desires  to satisfy his supreme senses     now the change has come to pass  the individual man is a limited being   finite in himself  yet he is capable of apprehending that which is not  himself   the proper study of mankind is man   this is another way of  saying   thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself   which means  a man  is consummated in his knowledge of that which is not himself  the  abstract man  therefore the consummation lies in seeking that other  in  knowing that other  whereas the stuart proposition was   a man is  consummated in expressing his own self      the new spirit developed into the empirical and ideal systems of  philosophy  everything that is  is consciousness  and in every man s  consciousness  man is great and illimitable  whilst the individual is  small and fragmentary  therefore the individual must sink himself in the  great whole of mankind     this is the spirituality of shelley  the perfectibility of man  this is  the way in which we fulfil the commandment   be ye therefore perfect   even as your father which is in heaven is perfect   this is saint  paul s   now i know in part  but then shall i know even as i am known      when a man knows everything and understands everything  then he will be  perfect  and life will be blessed  he is capable of knowing everything  and understanding everything  hence he is justified in his hope of  infinite freedom and blessedness     the great inspiration of the new religion was the inspiration of  freedom  when i have submerged or distilled away my concrete body and my  limited desires  when i am like the skylark dissolved in the sky yet  filling heaven and earth with song  then i am perfect  consummated in  the infinite  when i am all that is not me  then i have perfect liberty   i know no limitation  only i must eliminate the self     it was this religious belief which expressed itself in science  science  was the analysis of the outer self  the elementary substance of the  self  the outer world  and the machine is the great reconstructed  selfless power  hence the active worship to which we were given at the  end of the last century  the worship of mechanized force     still we continue to worship that which is not me  the selfless world   though we would fain bring in the self to help us  we are shouting the  shakespearean advice to warriors   then simulate the action of the  tiger   we are trying to become again the tiger  the supreme  imperial   warlike self  at the same time our ideal is the selfless world  of equity     we continue to give service to the selfless god  we worship the great  selfless oneness in the spirit  oneness in service of the great  humanity  that which is not me  this selfless god is he who works for  all alike  without consideration  and his image is the machine which  dominates and cows us  we cower before it  we run to serve it  for it  works for all humanity alike     at the same time  we want to be warlike tigers  that is the horror  the  confusing of the two ends  we warlike tigers fit ourselves out with  machinery  and our blazing tiger wrath is emitted through a machine  it  is a horrible thing to see machines hauled about by tigers  at the mercy  of tigers  forced to express the tiger  it is a still more horrible  thing to see tigers caught up and entangled and torn in machinery  it is  horrible  a chaos beyond chaos  an unthinkable hell     the tiger is not wrong  the machine is not wrong  but we  liars   lip servers  duplicate fools  we are unforgivably wrong  we say   i will  be a tiger because i love mankind  out of love for other people  out of  selfless service to that which is not me  i will even become a tiger    which is absurd  a tiger devours because it is consummated in devouring   it achieves its absolute self in devouring  it does not devour because  its unselfish conscience bids it do so  for the sake of the other deer  and doves  or the other tigers     having arrived at the one extreme of mechanical selflessness  we  immediately embrace the other extreme of the transcendent self  but we  try to be both at once  we do not cease to be the one before we become  the other  we do not even play the roles in turn  we want to be the  tiger and the deer both in one  which is just ghastly nothingness  we  try to say   the tiger is the lamb and the lamb is the tiger   which is  nil  nihil  nought     the padrone took me into a small room almost contained in the thickness  of the wall  there the signora s dark eyes glared with surprise and  agitation  seeing me intrude  she is younger than the signore  a mere  village tradesman s daughter  and  alas  childless     it was quite true  the door stood open  madame put down the screw driver  and drew herself erect  her eyes were a flame of excitement  this  question of a door spring that made the door fly open when it should  make it close roused a vivid spark in her soul  it was she who was  wrestling with the angel of mechanism     she was about forty years old  and flame like and fierily sad  i think  she did not know she was sad  but her heart was eaten by some impotence  in her life     she subdued her flame of life to the little padrone  he was strange and  static  scarcely human  ageless  like a monkey  she supported him with  her flame  supported his static  ancient  beautiful form  kept it  intact  but she did not believe in him     now  the signora gemma held her husband together whilst he undid the  screw that fixed the spring  if they had been alone  she would have done  it  pretending to be under his direction  but since i was there  he did  it himself  a grey  shaky  highly bred little gentleman  standing on a  chair with a long screw driver  whilst his wife stood behind him  her  hands half raised to catch him if he should fall  yet he was strangely  absolute  with a strange  intact force in his breeding     they had merely adjusted the strong spring to the shut door  and  stretched it slightly in fastening it to the door jamb  so that it drew  together the moment the latch was released  and the door flew open     we soon made it right  there was a moment of anxiety  the screw was  fixed  and the door swung to  they were delighted  the signora gemma   who roused in me an electric kind of melancholy  clasped her hands  together in ecstasy as the door swiftly shut itself       ecco    she cried  in her vibrating  almost warlike woman s voice     ecco       her eyes were aflame as they looked at the door  she ran forward to try  it herself  she opened the door expectantly  eagerly  pouf   it shut  with a bang       ecco    she cried  her voice quivering like bronze  overwrought but  triumphant     i must try also  i opened the door  pouf  it shut with a bang  we all  exclaimed with joy     then the signor di paoli turned to me  with a gracious  bland  formal  grin  he turned his back slightly on the woman  and stood holding his  chin  his strange horse mouth grinning almost pompously at me  it was an  affair of gentlemen  his wife disappeared as if dismissed  then the  padrone broke into cordial motion  we must drink     he would show me the estate  i had already seen the house  we went out  by the glass doors on the left  into the domestic courtyard     it was lower than the gardens round it  and the sunshine came through  the trellised arches on to the flagstones  where the grass grew fine and  green in the cracks  and all was deserted and spacious and still  there  were one or two orange tubs in the light     then i heard a noise  and there in the corner  among all the pink  geraniums and the sunshine  the signora gemma sat laughing with a baby   it was a fair  bonny thing of eighteen months  the signora was  concentrated upon the child as he sat  stolid and handsome  in his  little white cap  perched on a bench picking at the pink geraniums     she laughed  bent forward her dark face out of the shadow  swift into a  glitter of sunshine near the sunny baby  laughing again excitedly   making mother noises  the child took no notice of her  she caught him  swiftly into the shadow  and they were obscured  her dark head was  against the baby s wool jacket  she was kissing his neck  avidly  under  the creeper leaves  the pink geraniums still frilled joyously in  the sunshine     i had forgotten the padrone  suddenly i turned to him inquiringly      the signora s nephew   he explained  briefly  curtly  in a small voice   it was as if he were ashamed  or too deeply chagrined     the woman had seen us watching  so she came across the sunshine with the  child  laughing  talking to the baby  not coming out of her own world to  us  not acknowledging us  except formally     the signor pietro  queer old horse  began to laugh and neigh at the  child  with strange  rancorous envy  the child twisted its face to cry   the signora caught it away  dancing back a few yards from her  old husband      i am a stranger   i said to her across the distance   he is afraid of a  stranger       no  no   she cried back  her eyes flaring up   it is the man  he always  cries at the men      she advanced again  laughing and roused  with the child in her arms  her  husband stood as if overcast  obliterated  she and i and the baby  in  the sunshine  laughed a moment  then i heard the neighing  forced laugh  of the old man  he would not be left out  he seemed to force himself  forward  he was bitter  acrid with chagrin and obliteration  struggling  as if to assert his own existence  he was nullified     the woman also was uncomfortable  i could see she wanted to go away with  the child  to enjoy him alone  with palpitating  pained enjoyment  it  was her brother s boy  and the old padrone was as if nullified by her  ecstasy over the baby  he held his chin  gloomy  fretful  unimportant     he was annulled  i was startled when i realized it  it was as though his  reality were not attested till he had a child  it was as if his  raison  d etre  had been to have a son  and he had no children  therefore he had  no  raison d etre   he was nothing  a shadow that vanishes into nothing   and he was ashamed  consumed by his own nothingness     i was startled  this  then  is the secret of italy s attraction for us   this phallic worship  to the italian the phallus is the symbol of  individual creative immortality  to each man his own godhead  the child  is but the evidence of the godhead     and this is why the italian is attractive  supple  and beautiful   because he worships the godhead in the flesh  we envy him  we feel pale  and insignificant beside him  yet at the same time we feel superior to  him  as if he were a child and we adult     wherein are we superior  only because we went beyond the phallus in the  search of the godhead  the creative origin  and we found the physical  forces and the secrets of science     we have exalted man far above the man who is in each one of us  our aim  is a perfect humanity  a perfect and equable human consciousness   selfless  and we obtain it in the subjection  reduction  analysis  and  destruction of the self  so on we go  active in science and mechanics   and social reform     but we have exhausted ourselves in the process  we have found great  treasures  and we are now impotent to use them  so we have said   what  good are these treasures  they are vulgar nothings   we have said   let  us go back from this adventuring  let us enjoy our own flesh  like the  italian   but our habit of life  our very constitution  prevents our  being quite like the italian  the phallus will never serve us as a  godhead  because we do not believe in it  no northern race does   therefore  either we set ourselves to serve our children  calling them   the future   or else we turn perverse and destructive  give ourselves  joy in the destruction of the flesh     the children are not the future  the living truth is the future  time  and people do not make the future  retrogression is not the future   fifty million children growing up purposeless  with no purpose save the  attainment of their own individual desires  these are not the future   they are only a disintegration of the past  the future is in living   growing truth  in advancing fulfilment     but it is no good  whatever we do  it is within the greater will towards  self reduction and a perfect society  analysis on the one hand  and  mechanical construction on the other  this will dominates us as a whole   and until the whole breaks down  the will must persist  so that now   continuing in the old  splendid will for a perfect selfless humanity  we  have become inhuman and unable to help ourselves  we are but attributes  of the great mechanized society we have created on our way to  perfection  and this great mechanized society  being selfless  is  pitiless  it works on mechanically and destroys us  it is our master  and our god     it is past the time to leave off  to cease entirely from what we are  doing  and from what we have been doing for hundreds of years  it is  past the time to cease seeking one infinite  ignoring  striving to  eliminate the other  the infinite is twofold  the father and the son   the dark and the light  the senses and the mind  the soul and the  spirit  the self and the not self  the eagle and the dove  the tiger and  the lamb  the consummation of man is twofold  in the self and in  selflessness  by great retrogression back to the source of darkness in  me  the self  deep in the senses  i arrive at the original  creative  infinite  by projection forth from myself  by the elimination of my  absolute sensual self  i arrive at the ultimate infinite  oneness in the  spirit  they are two infinites  twofold approach to god  and man must  know both     but he must never confuse them  they are eternally separate  the lion  shall never lie down with the lamb  the lion eternally shall devour the  lamb  the lamb eternally shall be devoured  man knows the great  consummation in the flesh  the sensual ecstasy  and that is eternal   also the spiritual ecstasy of unanimity  that is eternal  but the two  are separate and never to be confused  to neutralize the one with the  other is unthinkable  an abomination  confusion is horror and  nothingness     the two infinites  negative and positive  they are always related  but  they are never identical  they are always opposite  but there exists a  relation between them  this is the holy ghost of the christian trinity   and it is this  the relation which is established between the two  infinites  the two natures of god  which we have transgressed   forgotten  sinned against  the father is the father  and the son is the  son  i may know the son and deny the father  or know the father and deny  the son  but that which i may never deny  and which i have denied  is  the holy ghost which relates the dual infinites into one whole  which  relates and keeps distinct the dual natures of god  to say that the two  are one  this is the inadmissible lie  the two are related  by the  intervention of the third  into a oneness     there are two ways  there is not only one  there are two opposite ways  to consummation  but that which relates them  like the base of the  triangle  this is the constant  the absolute  this makes the ultimate  whole  and in the holy spirit i know the two ways  the two infinites   the two consummations  and knowing the two  i admit the whole  but  excluding one  i exclude the whole  and confusing the two  i make  nullity nihil       mais    said the signore  starting from his scene of ignominy  where  his wife played with another man s child    mais  voulez vous vous  promener dans mes petites terres       it came out fluently  he was so much roused in self defence and  self assertion     we walked under the pergola of bony vine stocks  secure in the sunshine  within the walls  only the long mountain  parallel with us  looking in     i said how i liked the big vine garden  i asked when it ended  the pride  of the padrone came back with a click  he pointed me to the terrace  to  the great shut lemon houses above  they were all his  but  he shrugged  his italian shoulders  it was nothing  just a little garden   vous  savez  monsieur   i protested it was beautiful  that i loved it  and  that it seemed to me  very  large indeed  he admitted that today   perhaps  it was beautiful       perche  parce que  il fait un tempo  cosi  tres bell   tres beau   ecco       he alighted on the word  beau  hurriedly  like a bird coming to ground  with a little bounce     the terraces of the garden are held up to the sun  the sun falls full  upon them  they are like a vessel slanted up  to catch the superb  heavy  light  within the walls we are remote  perfect  moving in heavy spring  sunshine  under the bony avenue of vines  the padrone makes little  exclamatory noises that mean nothing  and teaches me the names of  vegetables  the land is rich and black     opposite us  looking down on our security  is the long  arched mountain  of snow  we climbed one flight of steps  and we could see the little  villages on the opposite side of the lake  we climbed again  and could  see the water rippling     we came to a great stone building that i had thought was a storehouse   for open air storage  because the walls are open halfway up  showing the  darkness inside and the corner pillar very white and square and distinct  in front of it     entering carelessly into the dimness  i started  for at my feet was a  great floor of water  clear and green in its obscurity  going down  between the walls  a reservoir in the gloom  the signore laughed at my  surprise  it was for irrigating the land  he said  it stank  slightly   with a raw smell  otherwise  i said  what a wonderful bath it would  make  the old signore gave his little neighing laugh at the idea     then we climbed into a great loft of leaves  ruddy brown  stored in a  great bank under the roof  seeming to give off a little red heat  as  they gave off the lovely perfume of the hills  we passed through  and  stood at the foot of the lemon house  the big  blind building rose high  in the sunshine before us     all summer long  upon the mountain slopes steep by the lake  stands the  rows of naked pillars rising out of the green foliage like ruins of  temples  white  square pillars of masonry  standing forlorn in their  colonnades and squares  rising up the mountain sides here and there  as  if they remained from some great race that had once worshipped here  and  still  in the winter  some are seen  standing away in lonely places  where the sun streams full  grey rows of pillars rising out of a broken  wall  tier above tier  naked to the sky  forsaken     they are the lemon plantations  and the pillars are to support the heavy  branches of the trees  but finally to act as scaffolding of the great  wooden houses that stand blind and ugly  covering the lemon trees in  the winter     in november  when cold winds came down and snow had fallen on the  mountains  from out of the storehouses the men were carrying timber  and  we heard the clang of falling planks  then  as we walked along the  military road on the mountain side  we saw below  on the top of the  lemon gardens  long  thin poles laid from pillar to pillar  and we heard  the two men talking and singing as they walked across perilously   placing the poles  in their clumsy zoccoli they strode easily across   though they had twenty or thirty feet to fall if they slipped  but the  mountain side  rising steeply  seemed near  and above their heads the  rocks glowed high into the sky  so that the sense of elevation must have  been taken away  at any rate  they went easily from pillar summit to  pillar summit  with a great cave of space below  then again was the  rattle and clang of planks being laid in order  ringing from the  mountain side over the blue lake  till a platform of timber  old and  brown  projected from the mountain side  a floor when seen from above  a  hanging roof when seen from below  and we  on the road above  saw the  men sitting easily on this flimsy hanging platform  hammering the  planks  and all day long the sound of hammering echoed among the rocks  and olive woods  and came  a faint  quick concussion  to the men on the  boats far out  when the roofs were on they put in the fronts  blocked in  between the white pillars withhold  dark wood  in roughly made panels   and here and there  at irregular intervals  was a panel of glass  pane  overlapping pane in the long strip of narrow window  so that now these  enormous  unsightly buildings bulge out on the mountain sides  rising in  two or three receding tiers  blind  dark  sordid looking places     in the morning i often lie in bed and watch the sunrise  the lake lies  dim and milky  the mountains are dark blue at the back  while over them  the sky gushes and glistens with light  at a certain place on the  mountain ridge the light burns gold  seems to fuse a little groove on  the hill s rim  it fuses and fuses at this point  till of a sudden it  comes  the intense  molten  living light  the mountains melt suddenly   the light steps down  there is a glitter  a spangle  a clutch of  spangles  a great unbearable sun track flashing across the milky lake   and the light falls on my face  then  looking aside  i hear the little  slotting noise which tells me they are opening the lemon gardens  a long  panel here and there  a long slot of darkness at irregular intervals  between the brown wood and the glass stripes       voulez vous    the signore bows me in with outstretched  hand    voulez vous entrer  monsieur       i went into the lemon house  where the poor threes seem to mope in the  darkness  it is an immense  dark  cold place  tall lemon trees  heavy  with half visible fruit  crowd together  and rise in the gloom  they  look like ghosts in the darkness of the underworld  stately  and as if  in life  but only grand shadows of themselves  and lurking here and  there  i see one of the pillars  but he  too  seems a shadow  not one of  the dazzling white fellows i knew  here we are trees  men  pillars  the  dark earth  the sad black paths  shut in in this enormous box  it is  true  there are long strips of window and slots of space  so that the  front is striped  and an occasional beam of light fingers the leaves of  an enclosed tree and the sickly round lemons  but it is nevertheless  very gloomy      but it is much colder in here than outside   i said      yes   replied the signore   now  but at night  i  think        i almost wished it were night to try  i wanted to imagine the trees  cosy  they seemed now in the underworld  between the lemon trees  beside  the path  were little orange trees  and dozens of oranges hanging like  hot coals in the twilight  when i warm my hands at them the signore  breaks me off one twig after another  till i have a bunch of burning  oranges among dark leaves  a heavy bouquet  looking down the hades of  the lemon house  the many ruddy clustered oranges beside the path remind  me of the lights of a village along the lake at night  while the pale  lemons above are the stars  there is a subtle  exquisite scent of lemon  flowers  then i notice a citron  he hangs heavy and bloated upon so  small a tree  that he seems a dark green enormity  there is a great host  of lemons overhead  half visible  a swarm of ruddy oranges by the paths   and here and there a fat citron  it is almost like being under the sea     at the corners of the path were round little patches of ash and stumps  of charred wood  where fires had been kindled inside the house on cold  nights  for during the second and third weeks in january the snow came  down so low on the mountains that  after climbing for an hour  i found  myself in a snow lane  and saw olive orchards on lawns of snow     the padrone says that all lemons and sweet oranges are grafted on a  bitter orange stock  the plants raised from seed  lemon and sweet  orange  fell prey to disease  so the cultivators found it safe only to  raise the native bitter orange  and then graft upon it     and the maestra  she is the schoolmistress  who wears black gloves while  she teaches us italian  says that the lemon was brought by st francis of  assisi  who came to the garda here and founded a church and a monastery   certainly the church of san francesco is very old and dilapidated  and  its cloisters have some beautiful and original carvings of leaves and  fruit upon the pillars  which seem to connect san francesco with the  lemon  i imagine him wandering here with a lemon in his pocket  perhaps  he made lemonade in the hot summer  but bacchus had been before him in  the drink trade     looking at his lemons  the signore sighed  i think he hates them  they  are leaving him in the lurch  they are sold retail at a halfpenny each  all the year round   but that is as dear  or dearer  than in england   i  say   ah  but   says the maestra   that is because your lemons are  outdoor fruit from sicily   pero   one of our lemons is as good as  two   from elsewhere      it is true these lemons have an exquisite fragrance and perfume  but  whether their force as lemons is double that of an ordinary fruit is a  question  oranges are sold at fourpence halfpenny the kilo  it comes  about five for twopence  small ones  the citrons are sold also by weight  in salo for the making of that liqueur known as  cedro   one citron  fetches sometimes a shilling or more  but then the demand is necessarily  small  so that it is evident  from these figures  the lago di garda  cannot afford to grow its lemons much longer  the gardens are already  many of them in ruins  and still more  da vendere      we went out of the shadow of the lemon house on to the roof of the  section below us  when we came to the brink of the roof i sat down  the  padrone stood behind me  a shabby  shaky little figure on his roof in  the sky  a little figure of dilapidation  dilapidated as the  lemon houses themselves     we were always level with the mountain snow opposite  a film of pure  blue was on the hills to the right and the left  there had been a wind   but it was still now  the water breathed an iridescent dust on the far  shore  where the villages were groups of specks     on the low level of the world  on the lake  an orange sailed boat leaned  slim to the dark blue water  which had flecks of foam  a woman went  down hill quickly  with two goats and a sheep  among the olives a man  was whistling       voyez    said the padrone  with distant  perfect melancholy   there  was once a lemon garden also there  you see the short pillars  cut off  to make a pergola for the vine  once there were twice as many lemons as  now  now we must have vine instead  from that piece of land i had two  hundred lire a year  in lemons  from the vine i have only eighty       but wine is a valuable crop   i said      ah   cosi cosi   for a man who grows much  for me   poco  poco  peu       suddenly his face broke into a smile of profound melancholy  almost a  grin  like a gargoyle  it was the real italian melancholy  very  deep  static       vous voyez  monsieur   the lemon  it is all the year  all the year   but the vine  one crop        he lifts his shoulders and spreads his hands with that gesture of  finality and fatality  while his face takes the blank  ageless look of  misery  like a monkey s  there is no hope  there is the present  either  that is enough  the present  or there is nothing     i sat and looked at the lake  it was beautiful as paradise  as the first  creation  on the shores were the ruined lemon pillars standing out in  melancholy  the clumsy  enclosed lemon houses seemed ramshackle  bulging  among vine stocks and olive trees  the villages  too  clustered upon  their churches  seemed to belong to the past  they seemed to be  lingering in bygone centuries      but it is very beautiful   i protested   in england        ah  in england   exclaimed the padrone  the same ageless  monkey like  grin of fatality  tempered by cunning  coming on his face   in england  you have the wealth   les richesses   you have the mineral coal and the  machines   vous savez   here we have the sun       he lifted his withered hand to the sky  to the wonderful source of that  blue day  and he smiled  in histrionic triumph  but his triumph was only  histrionic  the machines were more to his soul than the sun  he did not  know these mechanisms  their great  human contrived  inhuman power  and  he wanted to know them  as for the sun  that is common property  and no  man is distinguished by it  he wanted machines  machine production   money  and human power  he wanted to know the joy of man who has got the  earth in his grip  bound it up with railways  burrowed it with iron  fingers  subdued it  he wanted this last triumph of the ego  this last  reduction  he wanted to go where the english have gone  beyond the self   into the great inhuman not self  to create the great unliving creators   the machines  out of the active forces of nature that existed  before flesh     but he is too old  it remains for the young italian to embrace his  mistress  the machine     i sat on the roof of the lemon house  with the lake below and the snowy  mountain opposite  and looked at the ruins on the old  olive fuming  shores  at all the peace of the ancient world still covered in sunshine   and the past seemed to me so lovely that one must look towards it   backwards  only backwards  where there is peace and beauty and no more  dissonance     i thought of england  the great mass of london  and the black  fuming   laborious midlands and north country  it seemed horrible  and yet  it  was better than the padrone  this old  monkey like cunning of fatality   it is better to go forward into error than to stay fixed inextricably  in the past     yet what should become of the world  there was london and the industrial  counties spreading like a blackness over all the world  horrible  in the  end destructive  and the garda was so lovely under the sky of sunshine   it was intolerable  for away  beyond  beyond all the snowy alps  with  the iridescence of eternal ice above them  was this england  black and  foul and dry  with her soul worn down  almost worn away  and england was  conquering the world with her machines and her horrible destruction of  natural life  she was conquering the whole world     and yet  was she not herself finished in this work  she had had enough   she had conquered the natural life to the end  she was replete with the  conquest of the outer world  satisfied with the destruction of the self   she would cease  she would turn round  or else expire     if she still lived  she would begin to build her knowledge into a great  structure of truth  there it lay  vast masses of rough hewn knowledge   vast masses of machines and appliances  vast masses of ideas and  methods  and nothing done with it  only teeming swarms of disintegrated  human beings seething and perishing rapidly away amongst it  till it  seems as if a world will be left covered with huge ruins  and scored by  strange devices of industry  and quite dead  the people disappeared   swallowed up in the last efforts towards a perfect  selfless society                the theatre      during carnival a company is playing in the theatre  on christmas day  the padrone came in with the key of his box  and would we care to see  the drama  the theatre was small  a mere nothing  in fact  a mere affair  of peasants  you understand  and the signor di paoli spread his hands  and put his head on one side  parrot wise  but we might find a little  diversion   un peu de divertiment   with this he handed me the key     i made suitable acknowledgements  and was really impressed  to be handed  the key of a box at the theatre  so simply and pleasantly  in the large  sitting room looking over the grey lake of christmas day  it seemed to  me a very graceful event  the key had a chain and a little shield of  bronze  on which was beaten out a large figure       so the next day we went to see  i spettri   expecting some good  crude  melodrama  the theatre is an old church  since that triumph of the deaf  and dumb  the cinematograph  has come to give us the nervous excitement  of speed  grimace agitation  and speed  as of flying atoms  chaos  many  an old church in italy has taken a new lease of life     this cast off church made a good theatre  i realized how cleverly it had  been constructed for the dramatic presentation of religious ceremonies   the east end is round  the walls are windowless  sound is well  distributed  now everything is theatrical  except the stone floor and  two pillars at the back of the auditorium  and the slightly  ecclesiastical seats below     there are two tiers of little boxes in the theatre  some forty in all   with fringe and red velvet  and lined with dark red paper  quite like  real boxes in a real theatre  and the padrone s is one of the best  it  just holds three people     we paid our threepence entrance fee in the stone hall and went upstairs   i opened the door of number    and we were shut in our little cabin   looking down on the world  then i found the barber  luigi  bowing  profusely in a box opposite  it was necessary to make bows all round   ah  the chemist  on the upper tier  near the barber  how do you do to  the padrona of the hotel  who is our good friend  and who sits  wearing  a little beaver shoulder cape  a few boxes off  very cold salutation to  the stout village magistrate with the long brown beard  who leans  forward in the box facing the stage  while a grouping of faces look out  from behind him  a warm smile to the family of the signora gemma  across  next to the stage  then we are settled     i cannot tell why i hate the village magistrate  he looks like a family  portrait by a flemish artist  he himself weighing down the front of the  picture with his portliness and his long brown beard  whilst the faces  of his family are arranged in two groups for the background  i think he  is angry at our intrusion  he is very republican and self important  but  we eclipse him easily  with the aid of a large black velvet hat  and  black furs  and our sunday clothes     downstairs the villagers are crowding  drifting like a heavy current   the women are seated  by church instinct  all together on the left  with  perhaps an odd man at the end of a row  beside his wife  on the right   sprawling in the benches  are several groups of bersaglieri  in grey  uniforms and slanting cock s feather hats  then peasants  fishermen  and  an odd couple or so of brazen girls taking their places on the  men s side     at the back  lounging against the pillars or standing very dark and  sombre  are the more reckless spirits of the village  their black felt  hats are pulled down  their cloaks are thrown over their mouths  they  stand very dark and isolated in their moments of stillness  they shout  and wave to each other when anything occurs     the men are clean  their clothes are all clean washed  the rags of the  poorest porter are always well washed  but it is sunday tomorrow  and  they are shaved only on a sunday  so that they have a week s black  growth on their chins  but they have dark  soft eyes  unconscious and  vulnerable  they move and balance with loose  heedless motion upon their  clattering zoccoli  they lounge with wonderful ease against the wall at  the back  or against the two pillars  unconscious of the patches on  their clothes or of their bare throats  that are knotted perhaps with a  scarlet rag  loose and abandoned  they lounge and talk  or they watch  with wistful absorption the play that is going on     they are strangely isolated in their own atmosphere  and as if revealed   it is as if their vulnerable being was exposed and they have not the wit  to cover it  there is a pathos of physical sensibility and mental  inadequacy  their mind is not sufficiently alert to run with their  quick  warm senses     the men keep together  as if to support each other  the women also are  together  in a hard  strong herd  it is as if the power  the hardness   the triumph  even in this italian village  were with the women in their  relentless  vindictive unity     that which drives men and women together  the indomitable necessity  is  like a bondage upon the people  they submit as under compulsion  under  constraint  they come together mostly in anger and in violence of  destructive passion  there is no comradeship between men and women  none  whatsoever  but rather a condition of battle  reserve  hostility     on sundays the uncomfortable  excited  unwilling youth walks for an hour  with his sweetheart  at a little distance from her  on the public  highway in the afternoon  this is a concession to the necessity for  marriage  there is no real courting  no happiness of being together   only the roused excitement which is based on a fundamental hostility   there is very little flirting  and what there is is of the subtle  cruel  kind  like a sex duel  on the whole  the men and women avoid each other   almost shun each other  husband and wife are brought together in a  child  which they both worship  but in each of them there is only the  great reverence for the infant  and the reverence for fatherhood or  motherhood  as the case may be  there is no spiritual love     in marriage  husband and wife wage the subtle  satisfying war of sex  upon each other  it gives a profound satisfaction  a profound intimacy   but it destroys all joy  all unanimity in action     on sunday afternoons the uncomfortable youth walks by the side of his  maiden for an hour in the public highway  then he escapes  as from a  bondage he goes back to his men companions  on sunday afternoons and  evenings the married woman  accompanied by a friend or by a child  she  dare not go alone  afraid of the strange  terrible sex war between her  and the drunken man  is seen leading home the wine drunken  liberated  husband  sometimes she is beaten when she gets home  it is part of the  process  but there is no synthetic love between men and women  there is  only passion  and passion is fundamental hatred  the act of love is  a fight     the child  the outcome  is divine  here the union  the oneness  is  manifest  though spirit strove with spirit  in mortal conflict  during  the sex passion  yet the flesh united with flesh in oneness  the phallus  is still divine  but the spirit  the mind of man  this has  become nothing     so the women triumph  they sit down below in the theatre  their  perfectly dressed hair gleaming  their backs very straight  their heads  carried tensely  they are not very noticeable  they seem held in  reserve  they are just as tense and stiff as the men are slack and  abandoned  some strange will holds the women taut  they seem like  weapons  dangerous  there is nothing charming nor winning about them  at  the best a full  prolific maternity  at the worst a yellow poisonous  bitterness of the flesh that is like a narcotic  but they are too strong  for the men  the male spirit  which would subdue the immediate flesh to  some conscious or social purpose  is overthrown  the woman in her  maternity is the law giver  the supreme authority  the authority of the  man  in work  in public affairs  is something trivial in comparison  the  pathetic ignominy of the village male is complete on sunday afternoon   on his great day of liberation  when he is accompanied home  drunk but  sinister  by the erect  unswerving  slightly cowed woman  his drunken  terrorizing is only pitiable  she is so obviously the more  constant power     and this is why the men must go away to america  it is not the money  it  is the profound desire to rehabilitate themselves  to recover some  dignity as men  as producers  as workers  as creators from the spirit   not only from the flesh  it is a profound desire to get away from women  altogether  the terrible subjugation to sex  the phallic worship     the company of actors in the little theatre was from a small town away  on the plain  beyond brescia  the curtain rose  everybody was still   with that profound  naive attention which children give  and after a few  minutes i realized that  i spettri  was ibsen s  ghosts   the peasants  and fishermen of the garda  even the rows of ungovernable children  sat  absorbed in watching as the norwegian drama unfolded itself     the actors are peasants  the leader is the son of a peasant proprietor   he is qualified as a chemist  but is unsettled  vagrant  prefers  play acting  the signer pietro di paoli shrugs his shoulders and  apologizes for their vulgar accent  it is all the same to me  i am  trying to get myself to rights with the play  which i have just lately  seen in munich  perfectly produced and detestable     it was such a change from the hard  ethical  slightly mechanized  characters in the german play  which was as perfect an interpretation as  i can imagine  to the rather pathetic notion of the italian peasants   that i had to wait to adjust myself     the mother was a pleasant  comfortable woman harassed by something  she  did not quite know what  the pastor was a ginger haired caricature  imitated from the northern stage  quite a lay figure  the peasants never  laughed  they watched solemnly and absorbedly like children  the servant  was just a slim  pert  forward hussy  much too flagrant  and then the  son  the actor manager  he was a dark  ruddy man  broad and thick set   evidently of peasant origin  but with some education now  he was the  important figure  the play was his     and he was strangely disturbing  dark  ruddy  and powerful  he could not  be the blighted son of  ghosts   the hectic  unsound  northern issue of  a diseased father  his flashy italian passion for his half sister was  real enough to make one uncomfortable  something he wanted and would  have in spite of his own soul  something which fundamentally he did  not want     it was this contradiction within the man that made the play so  interesting  a robust  vigorous man of thirty eight  flaunting and  florid as a rather successful italian can be  there was yet a secret  sickness which oppressed him  but it was no taint in the blood  it was  rather a kind of debility in the soul  that which he wanted and would  have  the sensual excitement  in his soul he did not want it  no  not at  all  and yet he must act from his physical desires  his physical will     his true being  his real self  was impotent  in his soul he was  dependent  forlorn  he was childish and dependent on the mother  to hear  him say    grazia  mamma    would have tormented the mother soul in any  woman living  such a child crying in the night  and for what     for he was hot blooded  healthy  almost in his prime  and free as a man  can be in his circumstances  he had his own way  he admitted no  thwarting  he governed his circumstances pretty much  coming to our  village with his little company  playing the plays he chose himself  and  yet  that which he would have he did not vitally want  it was only a  sort of inflamed obstinacy that made him so insistent  in the masculine  way  he was not going to be governed by women  he was not going to be  dictated to in the least by any one  and this because he was beaten by  his own flesh     his real man s soul  the soul that goes forth and builds up a new world  out of the void  was ineffectual  it could only revert to the senses   his divinity was the phallic divinity  the other male divinity  which is  the spirit that fulfils in the world the new germ of an idea  this was  denied and obscured in him  unused  and it was this spirit which cried  out helplessly in him through the insistent  inflammable flesh  even  this play acting was a form of physical gratification for him  it had in  it neither real mind nor spirit     it was so different from ibsen  and so much more moving  ibsen is  exciting  nervously sensational  but this was really moving  a real  crying in the night  one loved the italian nation  and wanted to help it  with all one s soul  but when one sees the perfect ibsen  how one hates  the norwegian and swedish nations  they are detestable     they seem to be fingering with the mind the secret places and sources of  the blood  impertinent  irreverent  nasty  there is a certain  intolerable nastiness about the real ibsen  the same thing is in  strindberg and in most of the norwegian and swedish writings  it is with  them a sort of phallic worship also  but now the worship is mental and  perverted  the phallus is the real fetish  but it is the source of  uncleanliness and corruption and death  it is the moloch  worshipped in  obscenity     which is unbearable  the phallus is a symbol of creative divinity  but  it represents only part of creative divinity  the italian has made it  represent the whole  which is now his misery  for he has to destroy his  symbol in himself     which is why the italian men have the enthusiasm for war  unashamed   partly it is the true phallic worship  for the phallic principle is to  absorb and dominate all life  but also it is a desire to expose  themselves to death  to know death  that death may destroy in them this  too strong dominion of the blood  may once more liberate the spirit of  outgoing  of uniting  of making order out of chaos  in the outer world   as the flesh makes a new order from chaos in begetting a new life  set  them free to know and serve a greater idea     the peasants below sat and listened intently  like children who hear and  do not understand  yet who are spellbound  the children themselves sit  spellbound on the benches till the play is over  they do not fidget or  lose interest  they watch with wide  absorbed eyes at the mystery  held  in thrall by the sound of emotion     but the villagers do not really care for ibsen  they let it go  on the  feast of epiphany  as a special treat  was given a poetic drama by  d annunzio   la fiaccola sotto il moggio    the light under the bushel      it is a foolish romantic play of no real significance  there are several  murders and a good deal of artificial horror  but it is all a very nice  and romantic piece of make believe  like a charade     so the audience loved it  after the performance of  ghosts  i saw the  barber  and he had the curious grey clayey look of an italian who is  cold and depressed  the sterile cold inertia  which the so called  passionate nations know so well  had settled on him  and he went  obliterating himself in the street  as if he were cold  dead     but after the d annunzio play he was like a man who has drunk sweet wine  and is warm       ah  bellissimo  bellissimo    he said  in tones of intoxicated  reverence  when he saw me      better than  i spettri    i said     he half raised his hands  as if to imply the fatuity of the question      ah  but    he said   it was d annunzio  the other          that was ibsen  a great norwegian   i said   famous all over the  world       but you know  d annunzio is a poet  oh  beautiful  beautiful   there  was no going beyond this   bello  bellissimo       it was the language which did it  it was the italian passion for  rhetoric  for the speech which appeals to the senses and makes no demand  on the mind  when an englishman listens to a speech he wants at least to  imagine that he understands thoroughly and impersonally what is meant   but an italian only cares about the emotion  it is the movement  the  physical effect of the language upon the blood which gives him supreme  satisfaction  his mind is scarcely engaged at all  he is like a child   hearing and feeling without understanding  it is the sensuous  gratification he asks for  which is why d annunzio is a god in italy  he  can control the current of the blood with his words  and although much  of what he says is bosh  yet his hearer is satisfied  fulfilled     carnival ends on the  th of february  so each thursday there is a serata  d  onore of one of the actors  the first  and the only one for which  prices were raised  to a fourpence entrance fee instead of  threepence  was for the leading lady  the play was  the wife of the  doctor   a modern piece  sufficiently uninteresting  the farce that  followed made me laugh     since it was her evening of honour  adelaida was the person to see  she  is very popular  though she is no longer young  in fact  she is the  mother of the young pert person of  ghosts      nevertheless  adelaida  stout and blonde and soft and pathetic  is the  real heroine of the theatre  the prima  she is very good at sobbing  and  afterwards the men exclaim involuntarily  out of their strong emotion     bella  bella    the women say nothing  they sit stiffly and  dangerously as ever  but  no doubt  they quite agree this is the true  picture of ill used  tear stained woman  the bearer of many wrongs   therefore they take unto themselves the homage of the men s   bella   bella    that follows the sobs  it is due recognition of their hard  wrongs   the woman pays   nevertheless  they despise in their souls the  plump  soft adelaida     dear adelaida  she is irreproachable  in every age  in every clime  she  is dear  at any rate to the masculine soul  this soft  tear blenched   blonde  ill used thing  she must be ill used and unfortunate  dear  gretchen  dear desdemona  dear iphigenia  dear dame aux camelias  dear  lucy of lammermoor  dear mary magdalene  dear  pathetic  unfortunate  soul  in all ages and lands  how we love you  in the theatre she  blossoms forth  she is the lily of the stage  young and inexperienced as  i am  i have broken my heart over her several times  i could write a  sonnet sequence to her  yes  the fair  pale  tear stained thing   white robed  with her hair down her back  i could call her by a hundred  names  in a hundred languages  melisande  elizabeth  juliet  butterfly   phedre  minnehaha  etc  each new time i hear her voice  with its faint  clang of tears  my heart grows big and hot  and my bones melt  i detest  her  but it is no good  my heart begins to swell like a bud under the  plangent rain     the last time i saw her was here  on the garda  at salo  she was the  chalked  thin armed daughter of rigoletto  i detested her  her voice had  a chalky squeak in it  and yet  by the end  my heart was overripe in my  breast  ready to burst with loving affection  i was ready to walk on to  the stage  to wipe out the odious  miscreant lover  and to offer her all  myself  saying   i can see it is real  love  you want  and you shall  have it   i  will give it to you      of course i know the secret of the gretchen magic  it is all in the   save me  mr hercules   phrase  her shyness  her timidity  her  trustfulness  her tears foster my own strength and grandeur  i am the  positive half of the universe  but so i am  if it comes to that  just as  positive as the other half     adelaida is plump  and her voice has just that moist  plangent strength  which gives one a real voluptuous thrill  the moment she comes on the  stage and looks round  a bit scared  she is  she   electra  isolde   sieglinde  marguerite  she wears a dress of black voile  like the lady  who weeps at the trial in the police court  this is her modern uniform   her antique garment is of trailing white  with a blonde pigtail and a  flower  realistically  it is black voile and a handkerchief     adelaida always has a handkerchief  and still i cannot resist it  i say    there s the hanky   nevertheless  in two minutes it has worked its way  with me  she squeezes it in her poor  plump hand as the tears begin to  rise  fate  or man  is inexorable  so cruel  there is a sob  a cry  she  presses the fist and the hanky to her eyes  one eye  then the other  she  weeps real tears  tears shaken from the depths of her soft  vulnerable   victimized female self  i cannot stand it  there i sit in the padrone s  little red box and stifle my emotion  whilst i repeat in my heart   what  a shame  child  what a shame   she is twice my age  but what is age in  such circumstances   your poor little hanky  it s sopping  there  then   don t cry  it ll be all right   i ll  see you re all right   all  men  are not beasts  you know   so i cover her protectively in my arms  and  soon i shall be kissing her  for comfort  in the heat and prowess of my  compassion  kissing her soft  plump cheek and neck closely  bringing my  comfort nearer and nearer     it is a pleasant and exciting role for me to play  robert burns did the  part to perfection         o wert thou in the cauld blast      on yonder lea  on yonder lea     how many times does one recite that to all the ophelias and gretchens in  the world         thy bield should be my bosom     how one admires one s bosom in that capacity  looking down at one s  shirt front  one is filled with strength and pride     why are the women so bad at playing this part in real life  this  ophelia gretchen role  why are they so unwilling to go mad and die for  our sakes  they do it regularly on the stage     but perhaps  after all  we write the plays  what a villain i am  what a  black browed  passionate  ruthless  masculine villain i am to the  leading lady on the stage  and  on the other hand  dear heart  what a  hero  what a fount of chivalrous generosity and faith  i am  anything   but a dull and law abiding citizen  i am a galahad  full of purity and  spirituality  i am the lancelot of valour and lust  i fold my hands  or  i cock my hat in one side  as the case may be  i am  myself   only  i am  not a respectable citizen  not that  in this hour of my glory and  my escape     dear heaven  how adelaida wept  her voice plashing like violin music  at  my ruthless  masculine cruelty  dear heart  how she sighed to rest on my  sheltering bosom  and how i enjoyed my dual nature  how i  admired myself     adelaida chose  la moglie del dottore  for her evening of honour  during  the following week came a little storm of coloured bills   great evening  of honour of enrico persevalli      this is the leader  the actor manager  what should he choose for his  great occasion  this broad  thick set  ruddy descendant of the peasant  proprietors of the plain  no one knew  the title of the play was  not revealed     so we were staying at home  it was cold and wet  but the maestra came  inflammably on that thursday evening  and were we not going to the  theatre  to see  amleto      poor maestra  she is yellow and bitter skinned  near fifty  but her dark  eyes are still corrosively inflammable  she was engaged to a lieutenant  in the cavalry  who got drowned when she was twenty one  since then she  has hung on the tree unripe  growing yellow and bitter skinned  never  developing       amleto    i say    non lo conosco       a certain fear comes into her eyes  she is schoolmistress  and has a  mortal dread of being wrong       si    she cries  wavering  appealing    una dramma inglese        english   i repeated      yes  an english drama       how do you write it      anxiously  she gets a pencil from her reticule  and  with black gloved  scrupulousness  writes  amleto        hamlet    i exclaim wonderingly       ecco  amleto    cries the maestra  her eyes aflame with thankful  justification     then i knew that signore enrico persevalli was looking to me for an  audience  his evening of honour would be a bitter occasion to him if the  english were not there to see his performance     i hurried to get ready  i ran through the rain  i knew he would take it  badly that it rained on his evening of honour  he counted himself a man  who had fate against him       sono un disgraziato  io       i was late  the first act was nearly over  the play was not yet alive   neither in the bosoms of the actors nor in the audience  i closed the  door of the box softly  and came forward  the rolling italian eyes of  hamlet glanced up at me  there came a new impulse over the court  of denmark     enrico looked a sad fool in his melancholy black  the doublet sat close   making him stout and vulgar  the knee breeches seemed to exaggerate the  commonness of his thick  rather short  strutting legs  and he carried a  long black rag  as a cloak  for histrionic purposes  and he had on his  face a portentous grimace of melancholy and philosophic importance  his  was the caricature of hamlet s melancholy self absorption     i stooped to arrange my footstool and compose my countenance  i was  trying not to grin  for the first time  attired in philosophic  melancholy of black silk  enrico looked a boor and a fool  his  close cropped  rather animal head was common above the effeminate  doublet  his sturdy  ordinary figure looked absurd in a  melancholic droop     all the actors alike were out of their element  their majesties of  denmark were touching  the queen  burly little peasant woman  was ill at  ease in her pink satin  enrico had had no mercy  he knew she loved to be  the scolding servant or housekeeper  with her head tied up in a  handkerchief  shrill and vulgar  yet here she was pranked out in an  expanse of satin  la regina  regina  indeed     she obediently did her best to be important  indeed  she rather fancied  herself  she looked sideways at the audience  self consciously  quite  ready to be accepted as an imposing and noble person  if they would  esteem her such  her voice sounded hoarse and common  but whether it was  the pink satin in contrast  or a cold  i do not know  she was almost  childishly afraid to move  before she began a speech she looked down and  kicked her skirt viciously  so that she was sure it was under control   then she let go  she was a burly  downright little body of sixty  one  rather expected her to box hamlet on the ears     only she liked being a queen when she sat on the throne  there she  perched with great satisfaction  her train splendidly displayed down the  steps  she was as proud as a child  and she looked like queen victoria  of the jubilee period     the king  her noble consort  also had new honours thrust upon him  as  well as new garments  his body was real enough but it had nothing at all  to do with his clothes  they established a separate identity by  themselves  but wherever he went  they went with him  to the confusion  of everybody     he was a thin  rather frail looking peasant  pathetic  and very gentle   there was something pure and fine about him  he was so exceedingly  gentle and by natural breeding courteous  but he did not feel kingly  he  acted the part with beautiful  simple resignation     enrico persevalli had overshot himself in every direction  but worst of  all in his own  he had become a hulking fellow  crawling about with his  head ducked between his shoulders  pecking and poking  creeping about  after other people  sniffing at them  setting traps for them  absorbed  by his own self important self consciousness  his legs  in their black  knee breeches  had a crawling  slinking look  he always carried the  black rag of a cloak  something for him to twist about as he twisted in  his own soul  overwhelmed by a sort of inverted perversity     i had always felt an aversion from hamlet  a creeping  unclean thing he  seems  on the stage  whether he is forbes robertson or anybody else  his  nasty poking and sniffing at his mother  his setting traps for the king   his conceited perversion with ophelia make him always intolerable  the  character is repulsive in its conception  based on self dislike and a  spirit of disintegration     there is  i think  this strain of cold dislike  or self dislike  through  much of the renaissance art  and through all the later shakespeare  in  shakespeare it is a kind of corruption in the flesh and a conscious  revolt from this  a sense of corruption in the flesh makes hamlet  frenzied  for he will never admit that it is his own flesh  leonardo da  vinci is the same  but leonardo loves the corruption maliciously   michelangelo rejects any feeling of corruption  he stands by the flesh   the flesh only  it is the corresponding reaction  but in the opposite  direction  but that is all four hundred years ago  enrico persevalli has  just reached the position  he  is  hamlet  and evidently he has great  satisfaction in the part  he is the modern italian  suspicious   isolated  self nauseated  labouring in a sense of physical corruption   but he will not admit it is in himself  he creeps about in self conceit   transforming his own self loathing  with what satisfaction did he reveal  corruption  corruption in his neighbours he gloated in  letting his  mother know he had discovered her incest  her uncleanness  gloated in  torturing the incestuous king  of all the unclean ones  hamlet was the  uncleanest  but he accused only the others     except in the  great  speeches  and there enrico was betrayed  hamlet  suffered the extremity of physical self loathing  loathing of his own  flesh  the play is the statement of the most significant philosophic  position of the renaissance  hamlet is far more even than orestes  his  prototype  a mental creature  anti physical  anti sensual  the whole  drama is the tragedy of the convulsed reaction of the mind from the  flesh  of the spirit from the self  the reaction from the great  aristocratic to the great democratic principle     an ordinary instinctive man  in hamlet s position  would either have set  about murdering his uncle  by reflex action  or else would have gone  right away  there would have been no need for hamlet to murder his  mother  it would have been sufficient blood vengeance if he had killed  his uncle  but that is the statement according to the aristocratic  principle     orestes was in the same position  but the same position two thousand  years earlier  with two thousand years of experience wanting  so that  the question was not so intricate in him as in hamlet  he was not nearly  so conscious  the whole greek life was based on the idea of the  supremacy of the self  and the self was always male  orestes was his  father s child  he would be the same whatever mother he had  the mother  was but the vehicle  the soil in which the paternal seed was planted   when clytemnestra murdered agamemnon  it was as if a common individual  murdered god  to the greek     but agamemnon  king and lord  was not infallible  he was fallible  he  had sacrificed iphigenia for the sake of glory in war  for the  fulfilment of the superb idea of self  but on the other hand he had made  cruel dissension for the sake of the concubines captured in war  the  paternal flesh was fallible  ungodlike  it lusted after meaner pursuits  than glory  war  and slaying  it was not faithful to the highest idea of  the self  orestes was driven mad by the furies of his mother  because of  the justice that they represented  nevertheless he was in the end  exculpated  the third play of the trilogy is almost foolish  with its  prating gods  but it means that  according to the greek conviction   orestes was right and clytemnestra entirely wrong  but for all that  the  infallible king  the infallible male self  is dead in orestes  killed by  the furies of clytemnestra  he gains his peace of mind after the  revulsion from his own physical fallibility  but he will never be an  unquestioned lord  as agamemnon was  orestes is left at peace   neutralized  he is the beginning of non aristocratic christianity     hamlet s father  the king  is  like agamemnon  a warrior king  but   unlike agamemnon  he is blameless with regard to gertrude  yet gertrude   like clytemnestra  is the potential murderer of her husband  as lady  macbeth is murderess  as the daughters of lear  the women murder the  supreme male  the ideal self  the king and father     this is the tragic position shakespeare must dwell upon  the woman  rejects  repudiates the ideal self which the male represents to her  the  supreme representative  king and father  is murdered by the wife and the  daughters     what is the reason  hamlet goes mad in a revulsion of rage and nausea   yet the women murderers only represent some ultimate judgement in his  own soul  at the bottom of his own soul hamlet has decided that the self  in its supremacy  father and king  must die  it is a suicidal decision  for his involuntary soul to have arrived at  yet it is inevitable  the  great religious  philosophic tide  which has been swelling all through  the middle ages  had brought him there     the question  to be or not to be  which hamlet puts himself  does not  mean  to live or not to live  it is not the simple human being who puts  himself the question  it is the supreme i  king and father  to be or not  to be king  father  in the self supreme  and the decision is  not to be     it is the inevitable philosophic conclusion of all the renaissance  the  deepest impulse in man  the religious impulse  is the desire to be  immortal  or infinite  consummated  and this impulse is satisfied in  fulfilment of an idea  a steady progression  in this progression man is  satisfied  he seems to have reached his goal  this infinity  this  immortality  this eternal being  with every step nearer which he takes     and so  according to his idea of fulfilment  man establishes the whole  order of life  if my fulfilment is the fulfilment and establishment of  the unknown divine self which i am  then i shall proceed in the  realizing of the greatest idea of the self  the highest conception of  the i  my order of life will be kingly  imperial  aristocratic  the body  politic also will culminate in this divinity of the flesh  this body  imbued with glory  invested with divine power and might  the king  the  emperor  in the body politic also i shall desire a king  an emperor  a  tyrant  glorious  mighty  in whom i see myself consummated and  fulfilled  this is inevitable     but during the middle ages  struggling within this pagan  original  transport  the transport of the ego  was a small dissatisfaction  a  small contrary desire  amid the pomp of kings and popes was the child  jesus and the madonna  jesus the king gradually dwindled down  there was  jesus the child  helpless  at the mercy of all the world  and there was  jesus crucified     the old transport  the old fulfilment of the ego  the davidian ecstasy   the assuming of all power and glory unto the self  the becoming infinite  through the absorption of all into the ego  this gradually became  unsatisfactory  this was not the infinite  this was not immortality   this was eternal death  this was damnation     the monk rose up with his opposite ecstasy  the christian ecstasy  there  was a death to die  the flesh  the self  must die  so that the spirit  should rise again immortal  eternal  infinite  i am dead unto myself   but i live in the infinite  the finite me is no more  only the infinite   the eternal  is     at the renaissance this great half truth overcame the other great  half truth  the christian infinite  reached by a process of abnegation   a process of being absorbed  dissolved  diffused into the great  not self  supplanted the old pagan infinite  wherein the self like a  root threw out branches and radicles which embraced the whole universe   became the whole     there is only one infinite  the world now cried  there is the great  christian infinite of renunciation and consummation in the not self  the  other  that old pride  is damnation  the sin of sins is pride  it is the  way to total damnation  whereas the pagans based their life on pride     and according to this new infinite  reached through renunciation and  dissolving into the others  the neighbour  man must build up his actual  form of life  with savonarola and martin luther the living church  actually transformed itself  for the roman church was still pagan  henry  viii simply said   there is no church  there is only the state   but  with shakespeare the transformation had reached the state also  the  king  the father  the representative of the consummate self  the maximum  of all life  the symbol of the consummate being  the becoming supreme   godlike  infinite  he must perish and pass away  this infinite was not  infinite  this consummation was not consummated  all this was fallible   false  it was rotten  corrupt  it must go  but shakespeare was also the  thing itself  hence his horror  his frenzy  his self loathing     the king  the emperor is killed in the soul of man  the old order of  life is over  the old tree is dead at the root  so said shakespeare  it  was finally enacted in cromwell  charles i took up the old position of  kingship by divine right  like hamlet s father  he was blameless  otherwise  but as representative of the old form of life  which mankind  now hated with frenzy  he must be cut down  removed  it was a  symbolic act     the world  our world of europe  had now really turned  swung round to a  new goal  a new idea  the infinite reached through the omission of self   god is all that which is not me  i am consummate when my self  the  resistant solid  is reduced and diffused into all that which is not me   my neighbour  my enemy  the great otherness  then i am perfect     and from this belief the world began gradually to form a new state  a  new body politic  in which the self should be removed  there should be  no king  no lords  no aristocrats  the world continued in its religious  belief  beyond the french revolution  beyond the great movement of  shelley and godwin  there should be no self  that which was supreme was  that which was not me  the other  the governing factor in the state was  the idea of the good of others  that is  the common good  and the   vital  governing idea in the state has been this idea since cromwell     before cromwell the idea was  for the king   because every man saw  himself consummated in the king  after cromwell the idea was  for the  good of my neighbour   or  for the good of the people   or  for the good  of the whole   this has been our ruling idea  by which we have more or  less lived     now this has failed  now we say that the christian infinite is not  infinite  we are tempted  like nietzsche  to return back to the old  pagan infinite  to say that is supreme  or we are inclined  like the  english and the pragmatist  to say   there is no infinite  there is no  absolute  the only absolute is expediency  the only reality is sensation  and momentariness   but we may say this  even act on it   a la sanine    but we never believe it     what is really absolute is the mystic reason which connects both  infinites  the holy ghost that relates both natures of god  if we now  wish to make a living state  we must build it up to the idea of the holy  spirit  the supreme relationship  we must say  the pagan infinite is  infinite  the christian infinite is infinite  these are our two  consummations  in both of these we are consummated  but that which  relates them alone is absolute     this absolute of the holy ghost we may call truth or justice or right   these are partial names  indefinite and unsatisfactory unless there be  kept the knowledge of the two infinites  pagan and christian  which they  go between  when both are there  they are like a superb bridge  on which  one can stand and know the whole world  my world  the two halves of  the universe       essere  o non essere  e qui il punto       to be or not to be was the question for hamlet to settle  it is no  longer our question  at least  not in the same sense  when it is a  question of death  the fashionable young suicide declares that his  self destruction is the final proof of his own incontrovertible being   and as for not being in our public life  we have achieved it as much as  ever we want to  as much as is necessary  whilst in private life there  is a swing back to paltry selfishness as a creed  and in the war there  is the position of neutralization and nothingness  it is a question of  knowing how  to be   and how  not to be   for we must fulfil both   enrico persevalli was detestable with his   essere  o non essere    he  whispered it in a hoarse whisper as if it were some melodramatic murder  he was about to commit  as a matter of fact  he knows quite well  and  has known all his life  that his pagan infinite  his transport of the  flesh and the supremacy of the male in fatherhood  is all  unsatisfactory  all his life he has really cringed before the northern  infinite of the not self  although he has continued in the italian habit  of self  but it is mere habit  sham     how can he know anything about being and not being when he is only a  maudlin compromise between them  and all he wants is to be a maudlin  compromise  he is neither one nor the other  he has neither being nor  riot being  he is as equivocal as the monks  he was detestable  mouthing  hamlet s sincere words  he has still to let go  to know what not being  is  before he can  be   till he has gone through the christian negation  of himself  and has known the christian consummation  he is a mere  amorphous heap     for the soliloquies of hamlet are as deep as the soul of man can go  in  one direction  and as sincere as the holy spirit itself in their  essence  but thank heaven  the bog into which hamlet struggled is almost  surpassed     it is a strange thing  if a man covers his face  and speaks with his  eyes blinded  how significant and poignant he becomes  the ghost of this  hamlet was very simple  he was wrapped down to the knees in a great  white cloth  and over his face was an open work woollen shawl  but the  naive blind helplessness and verity of his voice was strangely  convincing  he seemed the most real thing in the play  from the knees  downward he was laertes  because he had on laertes  white trousers and  patent leather slippers  yet he was strangely real  a voice out of  the dark     the ghost is really one of the play s failures  it is so trivial and  unspiritual and vulgar  and it was spoilt for me from the first  when i  was a child i went to the twopenny travelling theatre to see  hamlet    the ghost had on a helmet and a breastplate  i sat in pale transport       amblet   amblet  i  am  thy father s ghost      then came a voice from the dark  silent audience  like a cynical knife  to my fond soul      why tha arena  i can tell thy voice      the peasants loved ophelia  she was in white with her hair down her  back  poor thing  she was pathetic  demented  and no wonder  after  hamlet s  o  that this too  too solid flesh would melt   what then of  her young breasts and her womb  hamlet with her was a very disagreeable  sight  the peasants loved her  there was a hoarse roar  half of  indignation  half of roused passion  at the end of her scene     the graveyard scene  too  was a great success  but i could not bear  hamlet  and the grave digger in italian was a mere buffoon  the whole  scene was farcical to me because of the italian    questo cranio   signore    and enrico  dainty fellow  took the skull in a corner of his  black cloak  as an italian  he would not willingly touch it  it was  unclean  but he looked a fool  hulking himself in his lugubriousness  he  was as self important as d annunzio     the close fell flat  the peasants had applauded the whole graveyard  scene wildly  but at the end of all they got up and crowded to the  doors  as if to hurry away  this in spite of enrico s final feat  he  fell backwards  smack down three steps of the throne platform  on to the  stage  but planks and braced muscle will bounce  and signer amleto  bounced quite high again     it was the end of  amleto   and i was glad  but i loved the theatre  i  loved to look down on the peasants  who were so absorbed  at the end of  the scenes the men pushed back their black hats  and rubbed their hair  across their brows with a pleased  excited movement  and the women  stirred in their seats     just one man was with his wife and child  and he was of the same race as  my old woman at san tommaso  he was fair  thin  and clear  abstract  of  the mountains  he seemed to have gathered his wife and child together  into another  finer atmosphere  like the air of the mountains  and to  guard them in it  this is the real joseph  father of the child  he has a  fierce  abstract look  wild and untamed as a hawk  but like a hawk at  its own nest  fierce with love  he goes out and buys a tiny bottle of  lemonade for a penny  and the mother and child sip it in tiny sips   whilst he bends over  like a hawk arching its wings     it is the fierce spirit of the ego come out of the primal infinite  but  detached  isolated  an aristocrat  he is not an italian  dark blooded   he is fair  keen as steel  with the blood of the mountaineer in him  he  is like my old spinning woman  it is curious how  with his wife and  child  he makes a little separate world down there in the theatre  like  a hawk s nest  high and arid under the gleaming sky     the bersaglieri sit close together in groups  so that there is a  strange  corporal connexion between them  they have close cropped  dark   slightly bestial heads  and thick shoulders  and thick brown hands on  each other s shoulders  when an act is over they pick up their cherished  hats and fling on their cloaks and go into the hall  they are rather  rich  the bersaglieri     they are like young  half wild oxen  such strong  sturdy  dark lads   thickly built and with strange hard heads  like young male caryatides   they keep close together  as if there were some physical instinct  connecting them  and they are quite womanless  there is a curious  inter absorption among themselves  a sort of physical trance that holds  them all  and puts their minds to sleep  there is a strange  hypnotic  unanimity among them as they put on their plumed hats and go out  together  always very close  as if their bodies must touch  then they  feel safe and content in this heavy  physical trance  they are in love  with one another  the young men love the young men  they shrink from the  world beyond  from the outsiders  from all who are not bersaglieri of  their barracks     one man is a sort of leader  he is very straight and solid  solid like a  wall  with a dark  unblemished will  his cock feathers slither in a  profuse  heavy stream from his black oil cloth hat  almost to his  shoulder  he swings round  his feathers slip into a cascade  then he  goes out to the hall  his feather tossing and falling richly  he must be  well off  the bersaglieri buy their own black cock s plumes  and some  pay twenty or thirty francs for the bunch  so the maestra said  the poor  ones have only poor  scraggy plumes     there is something very primitive about these men  they remind me really  of agamemnon s soldiers clustered oil the seashore  men  all men  a  living  vigorous  physical host of men  but there is a pressure on these  italian soldiers  as if they were men caryatides  with a great weight on  their heads  making their brain hard  asleep  stunned  they all look is  if their real brain were stunned  as if there were another centre of  physical consciousness from which they lived     separate from them all is pietro  the young man who lounges on the wharf  to carry things from the steamer  he starts up from sleep like a  wild cat as somebody claps him on the shoulder  it is the start of a man  who has many enemies  he is almost an outlaw  will he ever find himself  in prison  he is the  gamin  of the village  well detested     he is twenty four years old  thin  dark  handsome  with a cat like  lightness and grace  and a certain repulsive   gamin  evil in his face   where everybody is so clean and tidy  he is almost ragged  his week s  beard shows very black in his slightly hollow cheeks  he hates the man  who has waked him by clapping him on the shoulder     pietro is already married  yet he behaves as if he were not  he has been  carrying on with a loose woman  the wife of the citron coloured barber   the siciliano  then he seats himself on the women s side of the theatre   behind a young person from bogliaco  who also has no reputation  and  makes her talk to him  he leans forward  resting his arms on the seat  before him  stretching his slender  cat like  flexible loins  the  padrona of the hotel hates him    ein frecher kerl    she says with  contempt  and she looks away  her eyes hate to see him     in the village there is the clerical party  which is the majority   there is the anti clerical party  and there are the ne er do wells  the  clerical people are dark and pious and cold  there is a curious  stone cold  ponderous darkness over them  moral and gloomy  then the  anti clerical party  with the syndaco at the head  is bourgeois and  respectable as far as the middle aged people are concerned  banal   respectable  shut off as by a wall from the clerical people  the young  anti clericals are the young bloods of the place  the men who gather  every night in the more expensive and less respectable cafe  these young  men are all free thinkers  great dancers  singers  players of the  guitar  they are immoral and slightly cynical  their leader is the young  shopkeeper  who has lived in vienna  who is a bit of a bounder  with a  veneer of sneering irony on an original good nature  he is well to do   and gives dances to which only the looser women go  with these reckless  young men  he also gets up parties of pleasure  and is chiefly  responsible for the coming of the players to the theatre this carnival   these young men are disliked  but they belong to the important class   they are well to do  and they have the life of the village in their  hands  the clerical peasants are priest ridden and good  because they  are poor and afraid and superstitious  there is  lastly  a sprinkling of  loose women  one who keeps the inn where the soldiers drink  these women  are a definite set  they know what they are  they pretend nothing else   they are not prostitutes  but just loose women  they keep to their own  clique  among men and women  never wanting to compromise anybody else     and beyond all these there are the franciscan friars in their brown  robes  so shy  so silent  so obliterated  as they stand back in the  shop  waiting to buy the bread for the monastery  waiting obscure and  neutral  till no one shall be in the shop wanting to be served  the  village women speak to them in a curious neutral  official  slightly  contemptuous voice  they answer neutral and humble  though distinctly     at the theatre  now the play is over  the peasants in their black hats  and cloaks crowd the hall  only pietro  the wharf lounger  has no cloak   and a bit of a cap on the side of his head instead of a black felt hat   his clothes are thin and loose on his thin  vigorous  cat like body  and  he is cold  but he takes no notice  his hands are always in his pockets   his shoulders slightly raised     the few women slip away home  in the little theatre bar the well to do  young atheists are having another drink  not that they spend much  a  tumbler of wine or a glass of vermouth costs a penny  and the wine is  horrible new stuff  yet the little baker  agostino  sits on a bench with  his pale baby on his knee  putting the wine to its lips  and the baby  drinks  like a blind fledgeling     upstairs  the quality has paid its visits and shaken hands  the syndaco  and the well to do half austrian owners of the woodyard  the bertolini   have ostentatiously shown their mutual friendship  our padrone  the  signer pietro di paoli  has visited his relatives the graziani in the  box next the stage and has spent two intervals with us in our box   meanwhile  his two peasants standing down below  pathetic  thin  contadini of the old school  like worn stones  have looked up at us as  if we are the angels in heaven  with a reverential  devotional eye  they  themselves far away below  standing in the bay at the back  below all     the chemist and the grocer and the schoolmistress pay calls  they have  all sat self consciously posed in the front of their boxes  like framed  photographs of themselves  the second grocer and the baker visit each  other  the barber looks in on the carpenter  then drops downstairs among  the crowd  class distinctions are cut very fine  as we pass with the  padrona of the hotel  who is a bavarian  we stop to speak to our own  padroni  the di paoli  they have a warm handshake and effusive polite  conversation for us  for maria samuelli  a distant bow  we realize  our mistake     the barber  not the siciliano  but flashy little luigi with the big  tie ring and the curls  knows all about the theatre  he says that enrico  persevalli has for his mistress carina  the servant in  ghosts   that  the thin  gentle  old looking king in  hamlet  is the husband of  adelaida  and carina is their daughter  that the old  sharp  fat little  body of a queen is adelaida s mother  that they all like enrico  persevalli  because he is a very clever man  but that the  comic   il  brillante  francesco  is unsatisfied     in three performances in epiphany week  the company took two hundred and  sixty five francs  which was phenomenal  the manager  enrico persevalli   and adelaida pay twenty four francs for every performance  or every  evening on which a performance is given  as rent for the theatre   including light  the company is completely satisfied with its reception  on the lago di garda     so it is all over  the bersaglieri go running all the way home  because  it is already past half past ten  the night is very dark  about four  miles up the lake the searchlights of the austrian border are swinging   looking for smugglers  otherwise the darkness is complete                san gaudenzio      in the autumn the little rosy cyclamens blossom in the shade of this  west side of the lake  they are very cold and fragrant  and their scent  seems to belong to greece  to the bacchae  they are real flowers of the  past  they seem to be blossoming in the landscape of phaedra and helen   they bend down  they brood like little chill fires  they are little  living myths that i cannot understand     after the cyclamens the christmas roses are in bud  it is at this season  that the cacchi are ripe on the trees in the garden  whole naked trees  full of lustrous  orange yellow  paradisal fruit  gleaming against the  wintry blue sky  the monthly roses still blossom frail and pink  there  are still crimson and yellow roses  but the vines are bare and the  lemon houses shut  and then  mid winter  the lowest buds of the  christmas roses appear under the hedges and rocks and by the streams   they are very lovely  these first large  cold  pure buds  like violets   like magnolias  but cold  lit up with the light from the snow     the days go by  through the brief silence of winter  when the sunshine  is so still and pure  like iced wine  and the dead leaves gleam brown   and water sounds hoarse in the ravines  it is so still and transcendent   the cypress trees poise like flames of forgotten darkness  that should  have been blown out at the end of the summer  for as we have candles to  light the darkness of night  so the cypresses are candles to keep the  darkness aflame in the full sunshine     meanwhile  the christmas roses become many  they rise from their budded   intact humbleness near the ground  they rise up  they throw up their  crystal  they become handsome  they are heaps of confident  mysterious  whiteness in the shadow of a rocky stream  it is almost uncanny to see  them  they are the flowers of darkness  white and wonderful  beyond belief     then their radiance becomes soiled and brown  they thaw  break  and  scatter and vanish away  already the primroses are coming out  and the  almond is in bud  the winter is passing away  on the mountains the  fierce snow gleams apricot gold as evening approaches  golden  apricot   but so bright that it is almost frightening  what can be so fiercely  gleaming when all is shadowy  it is something inhuman and unmitigated  between heaven and earth     the heavens are strange and proud all the winter  their progress goes on  without reference to the dim earth  the dawns come white and  translucent  the lake is a moonstone in the dark hills  then across the  lake there stretches a vein of fire  then a whole  orange  flashing  track over the whiteness  there is the exquisite silent passage of the  day  and then at evening the afterglow  a huge incandescence of rose   hanging above and gleaming  as if it were the presence of a host of  angels in rapture  it gleams like a rapturous chorus  then passes away   and the stars appear  large and flashing     meanwhile  the primroses are dawning on the ground  their light is  growing stronger  spreading over the banks and under the bushes  between  the olive roots the violets are out  large  white  grave violets  and  less serious blue ones  and looking down the bill  among the grey smoke  of olive leaves  pink puffs of smoke are rising up  it is the almond and  the apricot trees  it is the spring     soon the primroses are strong on the ground  there is a bank of small   frail crocuses shooting the lavender into this spring  and then the  tussocks and tussocks of primroses are fully out  there is full morning  everywhere on the banks and roadsides and stream sides  and around the  olive roots  a morning of primroses underfoot  with an invisible  threading of many violets  and then the lovely blue clusters of  hepatica  really like pieces of blue sky showing through a clarity of  primrose  the few birds are piping thinly and shyly  the streams sing  again  there is a strange flowering shrub full of incense  overturned  flowers of crimson and gold  like bohemian glass  between the olive  roots new grass is coming  day is leaping all clear and coloured from  the earth  it is full spring  full first rapture     does it pass away  or does it only lose its pristine quality  it deepens  and intensifies  like experience  the days seem to be darker and richer   there is a sense of power in the strong air  on the banks by the lake  the orchids are out  many  many pale bee orchids standing clear from the  short grass over the lake  and in the hollows are the grape hyacinths   purple as noon  with the heavy  sensual fragrance of noon  they are  many breasted  and full of milk  and ripe  and sun darkened  like  many breasted diana     we could not bear to live down in the village any more  now that the  days opened large and spacious and the evenings drew out in sunshine  we  could not bear the indoors  when above us the mountains shone in clear  air  it was time to go up  to climb with the sun     so after easter we went to san gaudenzio  it was three miles away  up  the winding mule track that climbed higher and higher along the lake   leaving the last house of the village  the path wound on the steep   cliff like side of the lake  curving into the hollow where the landslip  had tumbled the rocks in chaos  then out again on to the bluff of a  headland that hung over the lake     thus we came to the tall barred gate of san gaudenzio  on which was the  usual little fire insurance tablet  and then the advertisements for  beer   birra  verona   which is becoming a more and more popular drink     through the gate  inside the high wall  is the little garden of eden  a  property of three or four acres fairly level upon a headland over the  lake  the high wall girds it on the land side  and makes it perfectly  secluded  on the lake side it is bounded by the sudden drops of the  land  in sharp banks and terraces  overgrown with ilex and with laurel  bushes  down to the brink of the cliff  so that the thicket of the first  declivities seems to safeguard the property     the pink farm house stands almost in the centre of the little territory   among the olive trees  it is a solid  six roomed place  about fifty  years old  having been rebuilt by paolo s uncle  here we came to live  for a time with the fiori  maria and paolo  and their three children   giovanni and marco and felicina     paolo had inherited  or partly inherited  san gaudenzio  which had been  in his family for generations  he was a peasant of fifty three  very  grey and wrinkled and worn looking  but at the same time robust  with  full strong limbs and a powerful chest  his face was old  but his body  was solid and powerful  his eyes were blue like upper ice  beautiful  he  had been a fair haired man  now he was almost white     he  was strangely like the pictures of peasants in the northern italian  pictures  with the same curious nobility  the same aristocratic  eternal  look of motionlessness  something statuesque  his head was hard and  fine  the bone finely constructed  though the skin of his face was loose  and furrowed with work  his temples had that fine  hard clarity which is  seen in mantegna  an almost jewel like quality     we all loved paolo  he was so finished in his being  detached  with an  almost classic simplicity and gentleness  an eternal kind of sureness   there was also something concluded and unalterable about him  something  inaccessible     maria fiori was different  she was from the plain  like enrico  persevalli and the bersaglier from the venetian district  she reminded  me again of oxen  broad boned and massive in physique  dark skinned   slow in her soul  but  like the oxen of the plain  she knew her work   she knew the other people engaged in the work  her intelligence was  attentive and purposive  she had been a housekeeper  a servant  in  venice and verona  before her marriage  she had got the hang of this  world of commerce and activity  she wanted to master it  but she was  weighted down by her heavy animal blood     paolo and she were the opposite sides of the universe  the light and the  dark  yet they lived together now without friction  detached  each  subordinated in their common relationship  with regard to maria  paolo  omitted himself  maria omitted herself with regard to paolo  their souls  were silent and detached  completely apart  and silent  quite silent   they shared the physical relationship of marriage as if it were  something beyond them  a third thing     they had suffered very much in the earlier stages of their connexion   now the storm had gone by  leaving them  as it were  spent  they were  both by nature passionate  vehement  but the lines of their passion were  opposite  hers was the primitive  crude  violent flux of the blood   emotional and undiscriminating  but wanting to mix and mingle  his was  the hard  clear  invulnerable passion of the bones  finely tempered and  unchangeable  she was the flint and he the steel  but in continual  striking together they only destroyed each other  the fire was a third  thing  belonging to neither of them     she was still heavy and full of desire  she was much younger than he      how long did you know your signora before you were married   she asked  me      six weeks   i said       il paolo e me  venti giorni  tre settimane    she cried vehemently   three weeks they had known each other when they married  she still  triumphed in the fact  so did paolo  but it was past  strangely and  rather terribly past     what did they want when they came together  paolo and she  he was a man  over thirty  she was a woman of twenty three  they were both violent in  desire and of strong will  they came together at once  like two  wrestlers almost matched in strength  their meetings must have been  splendid  giovanni  the eldest child  was a tall lad of sixteen  with  soft brown hair and grey eyes  and a clarity of brow  and the same calm  simplicity of bearing which made paolo so complete  but the son had at  the same time a certain brownness of skin  a heaviness of blood  which  he had from his mother  paolo was so clear and translucent     in giovanni the fusion of the parents was perfect  he was a perfect  spark from the flint and steel  there was in paolo a subtle intelligence  in feeling  a delicate appreciation of the other person  but the mind  was unintelligent  he could not grasp a new order  maria fiori was much  sharper and more adaptable to the ways of the world  paolo had an almost  glass like quality  fine and clear and perfectly tempered  but he was  also finished and brittle  maria was much coarser  more vulgar  but also  she was more human  more fertile  with crude potentiality  his passion  was too fixed in its motion  hers too loose and overwhelming     but giovanni was beautiful  gentle  and courtly like paolo  but warm   like maria  ready to flush like a girl with anger or confusion  he stood  straight and tall  and seemed to look into the far distance with his  clear grey eyes  yet also he could look at one and touch one with his  look  he could meet one  paolo s blue eyes were like the eyes of the old  spinning woman  clear and blue and belonging to the mountains  their  vision seemed to end in space  abstract  they reminded me of the eyes of  the eagle  which looks into the sun  and which teaches its young to do  the same  although they are unwilling     marco  the second son  was thirteen years old  he was his mother s  favourite  giovanni loved his father best  but marco was his mother s  son  with the same brown gold and red complexion  like a pomegranate   and coarse black hair  and brown eyes like pebble  like agate  like an  animal s eyes  he had the same broad  bovine figure  though he was only  a boy  but there was some discrepancy in him  he was not unified  he had  no identity     he was strong and full of animal life  but always aimless  as though his  wits scarcely controlled him  but he loved his mother with a  fundamental  generous  undistinguishing love  only he always forgot what  he was going to do  he was much more sensitive than maria  more shy and  reluctant  but his shyness  his sensitiveness only made him more aimless  and awkward  a tiresome clown  slack and uncontrolled  witless  all day  long his mother shouted and shrilled and scolded at him  or hit him  angrily  he did not mind  he came up like a cork  warm and roguish and  curiously appealing  she loved him with a fierce protective love   grounded on pain  there was such a split  a contrariety in his soul  one  part reacting against the other  which landed him always into trouble     it was when marco was a baby that paolo had gone to america  they were  poor on san gaudenzio  there were the few olive trees  the grapes  and  the fruit  there was the one cow  but these scarcely made a living   neither was maria content with the real peasants  lot any more  polenta  at midday and vegetable soup in the evening  and no way out  nothing to  look forward to  no future  only this eternal present  she had been in  service  and had eaten bread and drunk coffee  and known the flux and  variable chance of life  she had departed from the old static  conception  she knew what one might be  given a certain chance  the  fixture was the thing she militated against  so paolo went to america   to california  into the gold mines     maria wanted the future  the endless possibility of life on earth  she  wanted her sons to be freer  to achieve a new plane of living  the  peasant s life was a slave s life  she said  railing against the poverty  and the drudgery  and it was quite true  paolo and giovanni worked  twelve and fourteen hours a day at heavy laborious work that would have  broken an englishman  and there was nothing at the end of it  yet paolo  was even happy so  this was the truth to him     it was the mother who wanted things different  it was she who railed and  railed against the miserable life of the peasants  when we were going to  throw to the fowls a dry broken penny roll of white bread  maria said   with anger and shame and resentment in her voice   give it to marco  he  will eat it  it isn t too dry for him      white bread was a treat for them even now  when everybody eats bread   and maria fiori hated it  that bread should be a treat to her children   when it was the meanest food of all the rest of the world  she was in  opposition to this order  she did not want her sons to be peasants   fixed and static as posts driven in the earth  she wanted them to be in  the great flux of life in the midst of all possibilities  so she at  length sent paolo to america to the gold mines  meanwhile  she covered  the wall of her parlour with picture postcards  to bring the outer world  of cities and industries into her house     paolo was entirely remote from maria s world  he had not yet even  grasped the fact of money  not thoroughly  he reckoned in land and olive  trees  so he had the old fatalistic attitude to his circumstances  even  to his food  the earth was the lord s and the fulness thereof  also the  leanness thereof  paolo could only do his part and leave the rest  if he  ate in plenty  having oil and wine and sausage in the house  and plenty  of maize meal  he was glad with the lord  if he ate meagrely  of poor  polenta  that was fate  it was the skies that ruled these things  and no  man ruled the skies  he took his fate as it fell from the skies     maria was exorbitant about money  she would charge us all she could for  what we had and for what was done for us     yet she was not mean in her soul  in her soul she was in a state of  anger because of her own closeness  it was a violation to her strong  animal nature  yet her mind had wakened to the value of money  she knew  she could alter her position  the position of her children  by virtue of  money  she knew it was only money that made the difference between  master and servant  and this was all the difference she would  acknowledge  so she ruled her life according to money  her supreme  passion was to be mistress rather than servant  her supreme aspiration  for her children was that in the end they might be masters and  not servants     paolo was untouched by all this  for him there was some divinity about a  master which even america had not destroyed  if we came in for supper  whilst the family was still at table he would have the children at once  take their plates to the wall  he would have maria at once set the table  for us  though their own meal were never finished  and this was not  servility  it was the dignity of a religious conception  paolo regarded  us as belonging to the signoria  those who are elect  near to god  and  this was part of his religious service  his life was a ritual  it was  very beautiful  but it made me unhappy  the purity of his spirit was so  sacred and the actual facts seemed such a sacrilege to it  maria was  nearer to the actual truth when she said that money was the only  distinction  but paolo had hold of an eternal truth  where hers was  temporal  only paolo misapplied this eternal truth  he should not have  given giovanni the inferior status and a fat  mean italian tradesman the  superior  that was false  a real falsity  maria knew it and hated it   but paolo could not distinguish between the accident of riches and the  aristocracy of the spirit  so maria rejected him altogether  and went to  the other extreme  we were all human beings like herself  naked  there  was no distinction between us  no higher nor lower  but we were  possessed of more money than she  and she had to steer her course  between these two conceptions  the money alone made the real  distinction  the separation  the being  the life made the common level     paolo had the curious peasant s avarice also  but it was not meanness   it was a sort of religious conservation of his own power  his own self   fortunately he could leave all business transactions on our account to  maria  so that his relation with us was purely ritualistic  he would  have given me anything  trusting implicitly that i would fulfil my own  nature as signore  one of those more godlike  nearer the light of  perfection than himself  a peasant  it was pure bliss to him to bring us  the first fruit of the garden  it was like laying it on an altar     and his fulfilment was in a fine  subtle  exquisite relationship  not of  manners  but subtle interappreciation  he worshipped a finer  understanding and a subtler tact  a further fineness and dignity and  freedom in bearing was to him an approach towards the divine  so he  loved men best of all  they fulfilled his soul  a woman was always a  woman  and sex was a low level whereon he did not esteem himself  but a  man  a doer  the instrument of god  he was really godlike     paolo was a conservative  for him the world was established and divine  in its establishment  his vision grasped a small circle  a finer nature   a higher understanding  took in a greater circle  comprehended the  whole  so that when paolo was in relation to a man of further vision  he  himself was extended towards the whole  thus he was fulfilled  and his  initial assumption was that every signore  every gentleman  was a man of  further  purer vision than himself  this assumption was false  but  maria s assumption  that no one had a further vision  no one was more  elect than herself  that we are all one flesh and blood and being  was  even more false  paolo was mistaken in actual life  but maria was  ultimately mistaken     paolo  conservative as he was  believing that a priest must be a priest  of god  yet very rarely went to church  and he used the religious oaths  that maria hated  even  porca maria   he always used oaths  either  bacchus or god or mary or the sacrament  maria was always offended  yet  it was she who  in her soul  jeered at the church and at religion  she  wanted the human society as the absolute  without religious  abstractions  so paolo s oaths enraged her  because of their profanity   she said  but it was really because of their subscribing to another  superhuman order  she jeered at the clerical people  she made a loud  clamour of derision when the parish priest of the village above went  down to the big village on the lake  and across the piazza  the quay   with two pigs in a sack on his shoulder  this was a real picture of the  sacred minister to her     one day  when a storm had blown down an olive tree in front of the  house  and paolo and giovanni were beginning to cut it up  this same  priest of mugiano came to san gaudenzio  he was an iron grey  thin   disreputable looking priest  very talkative and loud and queer  he  seemed like an old ne er do well in priests  black  and he talked  loudly  almost to himself  as drunken people do  at once  he  must show  the fiori how to cut up the tree  he must have the axe from paolo  he  shouted to maria for a glass of wine  she brought it out to him with a  sort of insolent deference  insolent contempt of the man and traditional  deference to the cloth  the priest drained the tumblerful of wine at one  drink  his thin throat with its adam s apple working  and he did not pay  the penny     then he stripped off his cassock and put away his hat  and  a ludicrous  figure in ill fitting black knee breeches and a not very clean shirt  a  red handkerchief round his neck  he proceeded to give great extravagant  blows at the tree  he was like a caricature  in the doorway maria was  encouraging him rather jeeringly  whilst she winked at me  marco was  stifling his hysterical amusement in his mother s apron  and prancing  with glee  paolo and giovanni stood by the fallen tree  very grave and  unmoved  inscrutable  abstract  then the youth came away to the doorway   with a flush mounting on his face and a grimace distorting its  youngness  only paolo  unmoved and detached  stood by the tree with  unchanging  abstract face  very strange  his eyes fixed in the ageless  stare which is so characteristic     meanwhile the priest swung drunken blows at the tree  his thin buttocks  bending in the green black broadcloth  supported on thin shanks  and  thin throat growing dull purple in the red knotted kerchief   nevertheless he was doing the job  his face was wet with sweat  he  wanted another glass of wine     he took no notice of us  he was strangely a local  even a mountebank  figure  but entirely local  an appurtenance of the district     it was maria who jeeringly told us the story of the priest  who shrugged  her shoulders to imply that he was a contemptible figure  paolo sat with  the abstract look on his face  as of one who hears and does not hear  is  not really concerned  he never opposed or contradicted her  but stayed  apart  it was she who was violent and brutal in her ways  but sometimes  paolo went into a rage  and then maria  everybody  was afraid  it was a  white heavy rage  when his blue eyes shone unearthly  and his mouth  opened with a curious drawn blindness of the old furies  there was  something of the cruelty of a falling mass of snow  heavy  horrible   maria drew away  there was a silence  then the avalanche was finished     they must have had some cruel fights before they learned to withdraw  from each other so completely  they must have begotten marco in hatred   terrible disintegrated opposition and otherness  and it was after this   after the child of their opposition was born  that paolo went away to  california  leaving his san gaudenzio  travelling with several  companions  like blind beasts  to havre  and thence to new york  then to  california  he stayed five years in the gold mines  in a wild valley   living with a gang of italians in a town of corrugated iron     all the while he had never really left san gaudenzio  i asked him   used  you to think of it  the lake  the monte baldo  the laurel trees down the  slope   he tried to see what i wanted to know  yes  he said  but  uncertainly  i could see that he had never been really homesick  it had  been very wretched on the ship going from havre to new york  that he  told me about  and he told me about the gold mines  the galleries  the  valley  the huts in the valley  but he had never really fretted for san  gaudenzio whilst he was in california     in real truth he was at san gaudenzio all the time  his fate was riveted  there  his going away was an excursion from reality  a kind of  sleep walking  he left his own reality there in the soil above the lake  of garda  that his body was in california  what did it matter  it was  merely for a time  and for the sake of his own earth  his land  he would  pay off the mortgage  but the gate at home was his gate all the time   his hand was on the latch     as for maria  he had felt his duty towards her  she was part of his  little territory  the rooted centre of the world  he sent her home the  money  but it did not occur to him  in his soul  to miss her  he wanted  her to be safe with the children  that was all  in his flesh perhaps he  missed the woman  but his spirit was even more completely isolated since  marriage  instead of having united with each other  they had made each  other more terribly distinct and separate  he could live alone  eternally  it was his condition  his sex was functional  like eating and  drinking  to take a woman  a prostitute at the camp  or not to take her   was no more vitally important than to get drunk or not to get drunk of a  sunday  and fairly often on sunday paolo got drunk  his world remained  unaltered     but maria suffered more bitterly  she was a young  powerful  passionate  woman  and she was unsatisfied body and soul  her soul s satisfaction  became a bodily unsatisfaction  her blood was heavy  violent  anarchic   insisting on the equality of the blood in all  and therefore on her own  absolute right to satisfaction     she took a wine licence for san gaudenzio  and she sold wine  there were  many scandals about her  somehow it did not matter very much  outwardly   the authorities were too divided among themselves to enforce public  opinion  between the clerical party and the radicals and the socialists   what canons were left that were absolute  besides  these wild villages  had always been ungoverned     yet maria suffered  even she  according to her conviction belonged to  paolo  and she felt betrayed  betrayed and deserted  the iron had gone  deep into her soul  paolo had deserted her  she had been betrayed to  other men for five years  there was something cruel and implacable in  life  she sat sullen and heavy  for all her quick activity  her soul was  sullen and heavy     i could never believe felicina was paolo s child  she was an  unprepossessing little girl  affected  cold  selfish  foolish  maria and  paolo  with real italian greatness  were warm and natural towards the  child in her  but they did not love her in their very souls  she was the  fruit of ash to them  and this must have been the reason that she was so  self conscious and foolish and affected  small child that she was     paolo had come back from america a year before she was born  a year  before she was born  maria insisted  the husband and wife lived together  in a relationship of complete negation  in his soul he was sad for her   and in her soul she felt annulled  he sat at evening in the  chimney seat  smoking  always pleasant and cheerful  not for a moment  thinking he was unhappy  it had all taken place in his subconsciousness   but his eyebrows and eyelids were lifted in a kind of vacancy  his blue  eyes were round and somehow finished  though he was so gentle and  vigorous in body  but the very quick of him was killed  he was like a  ghost in the house  with his loose throat and powerful limbs  his open   blue extinct eyes  and his musical  slightly husky voice  that seemed to  sound out of the past     and maria  stout and strong and handsome like a peasant woman  went  about as if there were a weight on her  and her voice was high and  strident  she  too  was finished in her life  but she remained unbroken   her will was like a hammer that destroys the old form     giovanni was patiently labouring to learn a little english  paolo knew  only four or five words  the chief of which were  a right    boss     bread   and  day   the youth had these by heart  and was studying a  little more  he was very graceful and lovable  but he found it difficult  to learn  a confused light  like hot tears  would come into his eyes  when he had again forgotten the phrase  but he carried the paper about  with him  and he made steady progress     he would go to america  he also  not for anything would he stay in san  gaudenzio  his dream was to be gone  he would come back  the world was  not san gaudenzio to giovanni     the old order  the order of paolo and of pietro di paoli  the  aristocratic order of the supreme god  god the father  the lord  was  passing away from the beautiful little territory  the household no  longer receives its food  oil and wine and maize  from out of the earth  in the motion of fate  the earth is annulled  and money takes its place   the landowner  who is the lieutenant of god and of fate  like abraham   he  too  is annulled  there is now the order of the rich  which  supersedes the order of the signoria     it is passing away from italy as it has passed from england  the peasant  is passing away  the workman is taking his place  the stability is gone   paolo is a ghost  maria is the living body  and the new order means  sorrow for the italian more even than it has meant for us  but he will  have the new order     san gaudenzio is already becoming a thing of the past  below the house   where the land drops in sharp slips to the sheer cliff s edge  over  which it is maria s constant fear that felicina will tumble  there are  the deserted lemon gardens of the little territory  snug down below   they are invisible till one descends by tiny paths  sheer down into  them  and there they stand  the pillars and walls erect  but a dead  emptiness prevailing  lemon trees all dead  gone  a few vines in their  place  it is only twenty years since the lemon trees finally perished of  a disease and were not renewed  but the deserted terrace  shut between  great walls  descending in their openness full to the south  to the lake  and the mountain opposite  seem more terrible than pompeii in their  silence and utter seclusion  the grape hyacinths flower in the cracks   the lizards run  this strange place hangs suspended and forgotten   forgotten for ever  its erect pillars utterly meaningless     i used to sit and write in the great loft of the lemon house  high up   far  far from the ground  the open front giving across the lake and the  mountain snow opposite  flush with twilight  the old matting and boards   the old disused implements of lemon culture made shadows in the deserted  place  then there would come the call from the back  away above     venga  venga mangiare       we ate in the kitchen  where the olive and laurel wood burned in the  open fireplace  it was always soup in the evening  then we played games  or cards  all playing  or there was singing  with the accordion  and  sometimes a rough mountain peasant with a guitar     but it is all passing away  giovanni is in america  unless he has come  back to the war  he will not want to live in san gaudenzio when he is a  man  he says  he and marco will not spend their lives wringing a little  oil and wine out of the rocky soil  even if they are not killed in the  fighting which is going on at the end of the lake  in my loft by the  lemon houses now i should hear the guns  and giovanni kissed me with a  kind of supplication when i went on to the steamer  as if he were  beseeching for a soul  his eyes were bright and clear and lit up with  courage  he will make a good fight for the new soul he wants  that is   if they do not kill him in this war                the dance      maria had no real licence for san gaudenzio  yet the peasants always  called for wine  it is easy to arrange in italy  the penny is paid  another time     the wild old road that skirts the lake side  scrambling always higher as  the precipice becomes steeper  climbing and winding to the villages  perched high up  passes under the high boundary wall of san gaudenzio   between that and the ruined church  but the road went just as much  between the vines and past the house as outside  under the wall  for the  high gates were always open  and men or women and mules come into the  property to call at the door of the homestead  there was a loud shout    ah  a  a  ah  mari  a  o  o  oh pa o   from outside  another wild   inarticulate cry from within  and one of the fiori appeared in the  doorway to hail the newcomer     it was usually a man  sometimes a peasant from mugiano  high up   sometimes a peasant from the wilds of the mountain  a wood cutter  or a  charcoal burner  he came in and sat in the house place  his glass of  wine in his hand between his knees  or on the floor between his feet   and he talked in a few wild phrases  very shy  like a hawk indoors  and  unintelligible in his dialect     sometimes we had a dance  then  for the wine to drink  three men came  with mandolines and guitars  and sat in a corner playing their rapid  tunes  while all danced on the dusty brick floor of the little parlour   no strange women were invited  only men  the young bloods from the big  village on the lake  the wild men from above  they danced the slow   trailing  lilting polka waltz round and round the small room  the  guitars and mandolines twanging rapidly  the dust rising from the soft  bricks  there were only the two english women  so men danced with men   as the italians love to do  they love even better to dance with men   with a dear blood friend  than with women      it s better like this  two men   giovanni says to me  his blue eyes  hot  his face curiously tender     the wood cutters and peasants take off their coats  their throats are  bare  they dance with strange intentness  particularly if they have for  partner an english signora  their feet in thick boots are curiously  swift and significant  and it is strange to see the englishwomen  as  they dance with the peasants transfigured with a kind of brilliant  surprise  all the while the peasants are very courteous  but quiet  they  see the women dilate and flash  they think they have found a footing   they are certain  so the male dancers are quiet  but even grandiloquent   their feet nimble  their bodies wild and confident     they are at a loss when the two english signoras move together and laugh  excitedly at the end of the dance      isn t it fine       fine  their arms are like iron  carrying you round       yes  yes  and the muscles on their shoulders  i never knew there were  such muscles  i m almost frightened       but it s fine  isn t it  i m getting into the dance       yes  yes  you ve only to let them take you      then the glasses are put down  the guitars give their strange  vibrant   almost painful summons  and the dance begins again     it is a strange dance  strange and lilting  and changing as the music  changed  but it had always a kind of leisurely dignity  a trailing kind  of polka waltz  intimate  passionate  yet never hurried  never violent  in its passion  always becoming more intense  the women s faces changed  to a kind of transported wonder  they were in the very rhythm of  delight  from the soft bricks of the floor the red ochre rose in a thin  cloud of dust  making hazy the shadowy dancers  the three musicians  in  their black hats and their cloaks  sat obscurely in the corner  making a  music that came quicker and quicker  making a dance that grew swifter  and more intense  more subtle  the men seeming to fly and to implicate  other strange inter rhythmic dance into the women  the women drifting  and palpitating as if their souls shook and resounded to a breeze that  was subtly rushing upon them  through them  the men worked their feet   their thighs swifter  more vividly  the music came to an almost  intolerable climax  there was a moment when the dance passed into a  possession  the men caught up the women and swung them from the earth   leapt with them for a second  and then the next phase of the dance had  begun  slower again  more subtly interwoven  taking perfect  oh   exquisite delight in every interrelated movement  a rhythm within a  rhythm  a subtle approaching and drawing nearer to a climax  nearer   till  oh  there was the surpassing lift and swing of the women  when the  woman s body seemed like a boat lifted over the powerful  exquisite wave  of the man s body  perfect  for a moment  and then once more the slow   intense  nearer movement of the dance began  always nearer  nearer   always to a more perfect climax     and the women waited as if in transport for the climax  when they would  be flung into a movement surpassing all movement  they were flung  borne  away  lifted like a boat on a supreme wave  into the zenith and nave of  the heavens  consummate     then suddenly the dance crashed to an end  and the dancers stood  stranded  lost  bewildered  on a strange shore  the air was full of red  dust  half lit by the lamp on the wall  the players in the corner were  putting down their instruments to take up their glasses     and the dancers sat round the wall  crowding in the little room  faint  with the transport of repeated ecstasy  there was a subtle smile on the  face of the men  subtle  knowing  so finely sensual that the conscious  eyes could scarcely look at it  and the women were dazed  like creatures  dazzled by too much light  the light was still on their faces  like a  blindness  a reeling  like a transfiguration  the men were bringing  wine  on a little tin tray  leaning with their proud  vivid loins  their  faces flickering with the same subtle smile  meanwhile  maria fiori was  splashing water  much water  on the red floor  there was the smell of  water among the glowing  transfigured men and women who sat gleaming in  another world  round the walls     the peasants have chosen their women  for the dark  handsome  englishwoman  who looks like a slightly malignant madonna  comes il  duro  for the   bella bionda    the wood cutter  but the peasants have  always to take their turn after the young well to do men from the  village below     nevertheless  they are confident  they cannot understand the  middle class diffidence of the young men who wear collars and ties and  finger rings     the wood cutter from the mountain is of medium height  dark  thin  and  hard as a hatchet  with eyes that are black like the very flaming thrust  of night  he is quite a savage  there is something strange about his  dancing  the violent way he works one shoulder  he has a wooden leg   from the knee joint  yet he dances well  and is inordinately proud  he  is fierce as a bird  and hard with energy as a thunderbolt  he will  dance with the blonde signora  but he never speaks  he is like some  violent natural phenomenon rather than a person  the woman begins to  wilt a little in his possession       e bello  il ballo    he asked at length  one direct  flashing  question       si  molto bello    cries the woman  glad to have speech again     the eyes of the wood cutter flash like actual possession  he seems now  to have come into his own  with all his senses  he is dominant  sure     he is inconceivably vigorous in body  and his dancing is almost perfect   with a little catch in it  owing to his lameness  which brings almost a  pure intoxication  every muscle in his body is supple as steel  supple   as strong as thunder  and yet so quick  so delicately swift  it is  almost unbearable  as he draws near to the swing  the climax  the  ecstasy  he seems to lie in wait  there is a sense of a great strength  crouching ready  then it rushes forth  liquid  perfect  transcendent   the woman swoons over in the dance  and it goes on  enjoyment  infinite   incalculable enjoyment  he is like a god  a strange natural phenomenon   most intimate and compelling  wonderful     but he is not a human being  the woman  somewhere shocked in her  independent soul  begins to fall away from him  she has another being   which he has not touched  and which she will fall back upon  the dance  is over  she will fall back on herself  it is perfect  too perfect     during the next dance  while she is in the power of the educated ettore   a perfect and calculated voluptuary  who knows how much he can get out  of this northern woman  and only how much  the wood cutter stands on the  edge of the darkness  in the open doorway  and watches  he is fixed upon  her  established  perfect  and all the while she is aware of the  insistent hawk like poising of the face of the wood cutter  poised on  the edge of the darkness  in the doorway  in possession   unrelinquishing     and she is angry  there is something stupid  absurd  in the hard   talon like eyes watching so fiercely and so confidently in the doorway   sure  unmitigated  has the creature no sense     the woman reacts from him  for some time she will take no notice of him   but he waits  fixed  then she comes near to him  and his will seems to  take hold of her  he looks at her with a strange  proud  inhuman  confidence  as if his influence with her was already accomplished       venga  venga un po     he says  jerking his head strangely to the  darkness      what   she replies  and passes shaken and dilated and brilliant   consciously ignoring him  passes away among the others  among those  who are safe     there is food in the kitchen  great hunks of bread  sliced sausage that  maria has made  wine  and a little coffee  but only the quality come to  eat  the peasants may not come in  there is eating and drinking in the  little house  the guitars are silent  it is eleven o clock     then there is singing  the strange bestial singing of these hills   sometimes the guitars can play an accompaniment  but usually not  then  the men lift up their heads and send out the high  half howling music   astounding  the words are in dialect  they argue among themselves for a  moment  will the signoria understand  they sing  the signoria does not  understand in the least  so with a strange  slightly malignant triumph   the men sing all the verses of their song  sitting round the walls of  the little parlour  their throats move  their faces have a slight  mocking smile  the boy capers in the doorway like a faun  with glee  his  straight black hair falling over his forehead  the elder brother sits  straight and flushed  but even his eyes glitter with a kind of yellow  light of laughter  paolo also sits quiet  with the invisible smile on  his face   only maria  large and active  prospering now  keeps  collected  ready to order a shrill silence in the same way as she orders  the peasants  violently  to keep their places     the boy comes to me and says      do you know  signore  what they are singing       no   i say     so he capers with furious glee  the men with the watchful eyes  all  roused  sit round the wall and sing more distinctly          si verra la primavera      fiorann  le mandoline       vienn  di basso le trentine      coi  taliani far  l amor      but the next verses are so improper that i pretend not to understand   the women  with wakened  dilated faces  are listening  listening hard   their two faces beautiful in their attention  as if listening to  something magical  a long way off  and the men sitting round the wall  sing more plainly  coming nearer to the correct italian  the song comes  loud and vibrating and maliciously from their reedy throats  it  penetrates everybody  the foreign women can understand the sound  they  can feel the malicious  suggestive mockery  but they cannot catch the  words  the smile becomes more dangerous on the faces of the men     then maria fiori sees that i have understood  and she cries  in her  loud  overriding voice       basta  basta      the men get up  straighten their bodies with a curious  offering  movement  the guitars and mandolines strike the vibrating strings  but  the vague northern reserve has come over the englishwomen  they dance  again  but without the fusion in the dance  they have had enough     the musicians are thanked  they rise and go into the night  the men pass  off in pairs  but the wood cutter  whose name and whose nickname i could  never hear  still hovered on the edge of the darkness     then maria sent him also away  complaining that he was too wild    proprio selvatico   and only the  quality  remained  the well to do  youths from below  there was a little more coffee  and a talking  a  story of a man who had fallen over a declivity in a lonely part going  home drunk in the evening  and had lain unfound for eighteen hours  then  a story of a donkey who had kicked a youth in the chest and killed him     but the women were tired  they would go to bed  still the two young men  would not go away  we all went out to look at the night     the stars were very bright overhead  the mountain opposite and the  mountains behind us faintly outlined themselves on the sky  below  the  lake was a black gulf  a little wind blew cold from the adige     in the morning the visitors had gone  they had insisted on staying the  night  they had eaten eight eggs each and much bread at one o clock in  the morning  then they had gone to sleep  lying on the floor in the  sitting room     in the early sunshine they had drunk coffee and gone down to the village  on the lake  maria was very pleased  she would have made a good deal of  money  the young men were rich  her cupidity seemed like her  very blossom                il duro      the first time i saw il duro was on a sunny day when there came up a  party of pleasure makers to san gaudenzio  they were three women and  three men  the women were in cotton frocks  one a large  dark  florid  woman in pink  the other two rather insignificant  the men i scarcely  noticed at first  except that two were young and one elderly     they were a queer party  even on a feast day  coming up purely for  pleasure  in the morning  strange  and slightly uncertain  advancing  between the vines  they greeted maria and paolo in loud  coarse voices   there was something blowsy and uncertain and hesitating about the women  in particular  which made one at once notice them     then a picnic was arranged for them out of doors  on the grass  they sat  just in front of the house  under the olive tree  beyond the well  it  should have been pretty  the women in their cotton frocks  and their  friends  sitting with wine and food in the spring sunshine  but somehow  it was not  it was hard and slightly ugly     but since they were picnicking out of doors  we must do so too  we were  at once envious  but maria was a little unwilling  and then she set a  table for us     the strange party did not speak to us  they seemed slightly uneasy and  angry at our presence  i asked maria who they were  she lifted her  shoulders  and  after a second s cold pause  said they were people from  down below  and then  in her rather strident  shrill  slightly bitter   slightly derogatory voice  she added      they are not people for you  signore  you don t know them      she spoke slightly angrily and contemptuously of them  rather  protectively of me  so that vaguely i gathered that they were not quite   respectable      only one man came into the house  he was very handsome  beautiful  rather  a man of thirty two or three  with a clear golden skin  and  perfectly turned face  something godlike  but the expression was  strange  his hair was jet black and fine and smooth  glossy as a bird s  wing  his brows were beautifully drawn  calm above his grey eyes  that  had long dark lashes     his eyes  however  had a sinister light in them  a pale  slightly  repelling gleam  very much like a god s pale gleaming eyes  with the  same vivid pallor  and all his face had the slightly malignant   suffering look of a satyr  yet he was very beautiful     he walked quickly and surely  with his head rather down  passing from  his desire to his object  absorbed  yet curiously indifferent  as if the  transit were in a strange world  as if none of what he was doing were  worth the while  yet he did it for his own pleasure  and the light on  his face  a pale  strange gleam through his clear skin  remained like a  translucent smile  unchanging as time     he seemed familiar with the household  he came and fetched wine at his  will  maria was angry with him  she railed loudly and violently  he was  unchanged  he went out with the wine to the party on the grass  maria  regarded them all with some hostility     they drank a good deal out there in the sunshine  the women and the  older man talked floridly  il duro crouched at the feast in his curious  fashion  he had strangely flexible loins  upon which he seemed to crouch  forward  but he was separate  like an animal that remains quite single   no matter where it is     the party remained until about two o clock  then  slightly flushed  it  moved on in a ragged group up to the village beyond  i do not know if  they went to one of the inns of the stony village  or to the large  strange house which belonged to the rich young grocer of the village  below  a house kept only for feasts and riots  uninhabited for the most  part  maria would tell me nothing about them  only the young well to do  grocer  who had lived in vienna  the bertolotti  came later in the  afternoon inquiring for the party     and towards sunset i saw the elderly man of the group stumbling home  very drunk down the path  after the two women  who had gone on in front   then paolo sent giovanni to see the drunken one safely past the  landslip  which was dangerous  altogether it was an unsatisfactory  business  very much like any other such party in any other country     then in the evening il duro came in  his name is faustino  but everybody  in the village has a nickname  which is almost invariably used  he came  in and asked for supper  we had all eaten  so he ate a little food alone  at the table  whilst we sat round the fire     afterwards we played  up  jenkins   that was the one game we played with  the peasants  except that exciting one of theirs  which consists in  shouting in rapid succession your guesses at the number of fingers  rapidly spread out and shut into the hands again upon the table     il duro joined in the game  and that was because he had been in america   and now was rich  he felt he could come near to the strange signori  but  he was always inscrutable     it was queer to look at the hands spread on the table  the englishwomen   having rings on their soft fingers  the large fresh hands of the elder  boy  the brown paws of the younger  paolo s distorted great hard hands  of a peasant  and the big  dark brown  animal  shapely hands  of faustino     he had been in america first for two years and then for five  years  seven years altogether  but he only spoke a very little english   he was always with italians  he had served chiefly in a flag factory   and had had very little to do save to push a trolley with flags from the  dyeing room to the drying room i believe it was this     then he had come home from america with a fair amount of money  he had  taken his uncle s garden  had inherited his uncle s little house  and he  lived quite alone     he was rich  maria said  shouting in her strident voice  he at once  disclaimed it  peasant wise  but before the signori he was glad also to  appear rich  he was mean  that was more  maria cried  half teasing  half  getting at him     he attended to his garden  grew vegetables all the year round  lived in  his little house  and in spring made good money as a vine grafter  he  was an expert vine grafter     after the boys had gone to bed he sat and talked to me  he was curiously  attractive and curiously beautiful  but somehow like stone in his clear  colouring and his clear cut face  his temples  with the black hair  were  distinct and fine as a work of art     but always his eyes had this strange  half diabolic  half tortured pale  gleam  like a goat s  and his mouth was shut almost uglily  his cheeks  stern  his moustache was brown  his teeth strong and spaced  the women  said it was a pity his moustache was brown       peccato   sa  per bellezza  i baffi neri  ah h       then a long drawn exclamation of voluptuous appreciation      you live quite alone   i said to him     he did  and even when he had been ill he was alone  he had been ill two  years before  his cheeks seemed to harden like marble and to become pale  at the thought  he was afraid  like marble with fear      but why   i said   why do you live alone  you are sad   e triste       he looked at me with his queer  pale eyes  i felt a great static misery  in him  something very strange       triste    he repeated  stiffening up  hostile  i could not understand       vuol  dire che hai l aria dolorosa    cried maria  like a chorus  interpreting  and there was always a sort of loud ring of challenge  somewhere in her voice      sad   i said in english      sad i  he repeated  also in english  and he did not smile or change   only his face seemed to become more stone like  and he only looked at  me  into my eyes  with the long  pale  steady  inscrutable look of a  goat  i can only repeat  something stone like      why   i said   don t you marry  man doesn t live alone       i don t marry   he said to me  in his emphatic  deliberate  cold  fashion   because i ve seen too much   ho visto troppo        i don t understand   i said     yet i could feel that paolo  sitting silent  like a monolith also  in  the chimney opening  he understood  maria also understood     il duro looked again steadily into my eyes       ho visto troppo    he repeated  and the words seemed engraved on  stone   i ve seen too much       but you can marry   i said   however much you have seen  if you have  seen all the world      he watched me steadily  like a strange creature looking at me      what woman   he said to me      you can find a woman  there are plenty of women   i said      not for me   he said   i have known too many  i ve known too much  i  can marry nobody       do you dislike women   i said      no  quite otherwise  i don t think ill of them       then why can t you marry  why must you live alone       why live with a woman   he said to me  and he looked mockingly   which  woman is it to be       you can find her   i said   there are many women      again he shook his head in the stony  final fashion      not for me  i have known too much       but does that prevent you from marrying      he looked at me steadily  finally  and i could see it was impossible for  us to understand each other  or for me to understand him  i could not  understand the strange white gleam of his eyes  where it came from     also i knew he liked me very much  almost loved me  which again was  strange and puzzling  it was as if he were a fairy  a faun  and had no  soul  but he gave me a feeling of vivid sadness  a sadness that gleamed  like phosphorescence  he himself was not sad  there was a completeness  about him  about the pallid otherworld he inhabited  which excluded  sadness  it was too complete  too final  too defined  there was no  yearning  no vague merging off into mistiness     he was clear and fine  as semi transparent rock  as a substance in moonlight  he seemed like a  crystal that has achieved its final shape and has nothing more  to achieve     that night he slept on the floor of the sitting room  in the morning he  was gone  but a week after he came again  to graft the vines     all the morning and the afternoon he was among the vines  crouching  before them  cutting them back with his sharp  bright knife  amazingly  swift and sure  like a god  it filled me with a sort of panic to see him  crouched flexibly  like some strange animal god  doubled on his  haunches  before the young vines  and swiftly  vividly  without thought   cut  cut  cut at the young budding shoots  which fell unheeded on to the  earth  then again he strode with his curious half goatlike movement  across the garden  to prepare the lime     he mixed the messy stuff  cow dung and lime and water and earth   carefully with his hands  as if he understood that too  he was not a  worker  he was a creature in intimate communion with the sensible world   knowing purely by touch the limey mess he mixed amongst  knowing as if  by relation between that soft matter and the matter of himself     then again he strode over the earth  a gleaming piece of earth himself   moving to the young vines  quickly  with a few clean cuts of the knife   he prepared the new shoot  which he had picked out of a handful which  lay beside him on the ground  he went finely to the quick of the plant   inserted the graft  then bound it up  fast  hard     it was like god grafting the life of man upon the body of the earth   intimately conjuring with his own flesh     all the while paolo stood by  somehow excluded from the mystery  talking  to me  to faustino  and il duro answered easily  as if his mind were  disengaged  it was his senses that were absorbed in the sensible life of  the plant  and the lime and the cow dung he handled     watching him  watching his absorbed  bestial  and yet godlike crouching  before the plant  as if he were the god of lower life  i somehow  understood his isolation  why he did not marry  pan and the ministers of  pan do not marry  the sylvan gods  they are single and isolated in  their being     it is in the spirit that marriage takes place  in the flesh there is  connexion  but only in the spirit is there a new thing created out of  two different antithetic things  in the body i am conjoined with the  woman  but in the spirit my conjunction with her creates a third thing   an absolute  a word  which is neither me nor her  nor of me nor of her   but which is absolute     and faustino had none of this spirit  in him sensation itself was  absolute  not spiritual consummation  but physical sensation  so he  could not marry  it was not for him  he belonged to the god pan  to the  absolute of the senses     all the while his beauty  so perfect and so defined  fascinated me  a  strange static perfection about him  but his movements  whilst they  fascinated  also repelled  i can always see him crouched before the  vines on his haunches  his haunches doubled together in a complete  animal unconsciousness  his face seeming in its strange golden pallor  and its hardness of line  with the gleaming black of the fine hair on  the brow and temples  like something reflective  like the reflecting  surface of a stone that gleams out of the depths of night  it was like  darkness revealed in its steady  unchanging pallor     again he stayed through the evening  having quarrelled once more with  the maria about money  he quarrelled violently  yet coldly  there was  something terrifying in it  and as soon as the matter of dispute was  settled  all trace of interest or feeling vanished from him     yet he liked  above all things  to be near the english signori  they  seemed to exercise a sort of magnetic attraction over him  it was  something of the purely physical world  as a magnetized needle swings  towards soft iron  he was quite helpless in the relation  only by  mechanical attraction he gravitated into line with us     but there was nothing between us except our complete difference  it was  like night and day flowing together                john      besides il duro  we found another italian who could speak english  this  time quite well  we had walked about four or five miles up the lake   getting higher and higher  then quite suddenly  on the shoulder of a  bluff far up  we came on a village  icy cold  and as if forgotten     we went into the inn to drink something hot  the fire of olive sticks  was burning in the open chimney  one or two men were talking at a table   a young woman with a baby stood by the fire watching something boil in a  large pot  another woman was seen in the house place beyond     in the chimney seats sat a young mule driver  who had left his two mules  at the door of the inn  and opposite him an elderly stout man  they got  down and offered us the seats of honour  which we accepted with  due courtesy     the chimneys are like the wide  open chimney places of old english  cottages  but the hearth is raised about a foot and a half or two feet  from the floor  so that the fire is almost level with the hands  and  those who sit in the chimney seats are raised above the audience in the  room  something like two gods flanking the fire  looking out of the cave  of ruddy darkness into the open  lower world of the room     we asked for coffee with milk and rum  the stout landlord took a seat  near us below  the comely young woman with the baby took the tin  coffee pot that stood among the grey ashes  put in fresh coffee among  the old bottoms  filled it with water  then pushed it more into  the fire     the landlord turned to us with the usual naive  curious deference  and  the usual question      you are germans       english       ah   inglesi       then there is a new note of cordiality  or so i always imagine  and the  rather rough  cattle like men who are sitting with their wine round the  table look up more amicably  they do not like being intruded upon  only  the landlord is always affable      i have a son who speaks english   he says  he is a handsome  courtly  old man  of the falstaff sort      oh       he has been in america       and where is he now       he is at home  o  nicoletta  where is the giovann       the comely young woman with the baby came in      he is with the band   she said     the old landlord looked at her with pride      this is my daughter in law   he said     she smiled readily to the signora      and the baby   we asked       mio figlio    cried the young woman  in the strong  penetrating voice  of these women  and she came forward to show the child to the signora     it was a bonny baby  the whole company was united in adoration and  service of the bambino  there was a moment of suspension  when religious  submission seemed to come over the inn room     then the signora began to talk  and it broke upon the italian  child reverence      what is he called       oscare   came the ringing note of pride  and the mother talked to the  baby in dialect  all  men and women alike  felt themselves glorified by  the presence of the child     at last the coffee in the tin coffee pot was boiling and frothing out of  spout and lid  the milk in the little copper pan was also hot  among the  ashes  so we had our drink at last     the landlord was anxious for us to see giovanni  his son  there was a  village band performing up the street  in front of the house of a  colonel who had come home wounded from tripoli  everybody in the village  was wildly proud about the colonel and about the brass band  the music  of which was execrable     we just looked into the street  the band of uncouth fellows was playing  the same tune over and over again before a desolate  newish house  a  crowd of desolate  forgotten villagers stood round in the cold upper  air  it seemed altogether that the place was forgotten by god and man     but the landlord  burly  courteous  handsome  pointed out with a  flourish the giovanni  standing in the band playing a cornet  the band  itself consisted only of five men  rather like beggars in the street   but giovanni was the strangest  he was tall and thin and somewhat  german looking  wearing shabby american clothes and a very high double  collar and a small american crush hat  he looked entirely like a  ne er do well who plays a violin in the street  dressed in the most  down at heel  sordid respectability      that is he  you see  signore  the young one under the balcony      the father spoke with love and pride  and the father was a gentleman   like falstaff  a pure gentleman  the daughter in law also peered out to  look at il giovann   who was evidently a figure of repute  in his  sordid  degenerate american respectability  meanwhile  this figure of  repute blew himself red in the face  producing staccato strains on his  cornet  and the crowd stood desolate and forsaken in the cold  upper  afternoon     then there was a sudden rugged   evviva  evviva    from the people  the  band stopped playing  somebody valiantly broke into a line of the song          tripoli  sara italiana       sara italiana al rombo del cannon       the colonel had appeared on the balcony  a smallish man  very yellow in  the face  with grizzled black hair and very shabby legs  they all seemed  so sordidly  hopelessly shabby     he suddenly began to speak  leaning forward  hot and feverish and  yellow  upon the iron rail of the balcony  there was something hot and  marshy and sick about him  slightly repulsive  less than human  he told  his fellow villagers how he loved them  how  when he lay uncovered on  the sands of tripoli  week after week  he had known they were watching  him from the alpine height of the village  he could feel that where he  was they were all looking  when the arabs came rushing like things gone  mad  and he had received his wound  he had known that in his own  village  among his own dear ones  there was recovery  love would heal  the wounds  the home country was a lover who would heal all her sons   wounds with love     among the grey desolate crowd were sharp  rending  bravos    the people  were in tears  the landlord at my side was repeating softly   abstractedly    caro  caro  ettore  caro colonello     and when it was  finished  and the little colonel with shabby  humiliated legs was gone  in  he turned to me and said  with challenge that almost frightened me       un brav  uomo         bravissimo    i said     then we  too  went indoors     it was all  somehow  grey and hopeless and acrid  unendurable     the colonel  poor devil  we knew him afterwards  is now dead  it is  strange that he is dead  there is something repulsive to me in the  thought of his lying dead  such a humiliating  somehow degraded corpse   death has no beauty in italy  unless it be violent  the death of man or  woman through sickness is an occasion of horror  repulsive  they belong  entirely to life  they are so limited to life  these people     soon the giovanni came home  and took his cornet upstairs  then he came  to see us  he was an ingenuous youth  sordidly shabby and dirty  his  fair hair was long and uneven  his very high starched collar made one  aware that his neck and his ears were not clean  his american crimson  tie was ugly  his clothes looked as if they had been kicking about on  the floor for a year     yet his blue eyes were warm and his manner and speech very gentle      you will speak english with us   i said      oh   he said  smiling and shaking his head   i could speak english very  well  but it is two years that i don t speak it now  over two years now   so i don t speak it       but you speak it very well       no  it is two years that i have not spoke  not a word  so  you see  i  have        you have forgotten it  no  you haven t  it will quickly come back       if i hear it  when i go to america  then i shall  i shall        you will soon pick it up       yes  i shall pick it up      the landlord  who had been watching with pride  now went away  the wife  also went away  and we were left with the shy  gentle  dirty  and  frowsily dressed giovanni     he laughed in his sensitive  quick fashion      the women in america  when they came into the store  they said   where  is john  where is john   yes  they liked me      and he laughed again  glancing with vague  warm blue eyes  very shy   very coiled upon himself with sensitiveness     he had managed a store in america  in a smallish town  i glanced at his  reddish  smooth  rather knuckly hands  and thin wrists in the frayed  cuff  they were real shopman s hands     the landlord brought some special feast day cake  so overjoyed he was to  have his giovanni speaking english with the signoria     when we went away  we asked  john  to come down to our villa to see us   we scarcely expected him to turn up     yet one morning he appeared  at about half past nine  just as we were  finishing breakfast  it was sunny and warm and beautiful  so we asked  him please to come with us picnicking     he was a queer shoot  again  in his unkempt longish hair and slovenly  clothes  a sort of very vulgar down at heel american in appearance  and  he was transported with shyness  yet ours was the world he had chosen as  his own  so he took his place bravely and simply  a hanger on     we climbed up the water course in the mountain side  up to a smooth  little lawn under the olive trees  where daisies were flowering and  gladioli were in bud  it was a tiny little lawn of grass in a level  crevice  and sitting there we had the world below us  the lake  the  distant island  the far off low verona shore     then  john  began to talk  and he talked continuously  like a foreigner   not saying the things he would have said in italian  but following the  suggestion and scope of his limited english     in the first place  he loved his father  it was  my father  my father   always  his father had a little shop as well as the inn in the village  above  so john had had some education  he had been sent to brescia and  then to verona to school  and there had taken his examinations to become  a civil engineer  he was clever  and could pass his examinations  but he  never finished his course  his mother died  and his father   disconsolate  had wanted him at home  then he had gone back  when he was  sixteen or seventeen  to the village beyond the lake  to be with his  father and to look after the shop      but didn t you mind giving up all your work   i said     he did not quite understand      my father wanted me to come back   he said     it was evident that giovanni had had no definite conception of what he  was doing or what he wanted to do  his father  wishing to make a  gentleman of him  had sent him to school in verona  by accident he had  been moved on into the engineering course  when it all fizzled to an  end  and he returned half baked to the remote  desolate village of the  mountain side  he was not disappointed or chagrined  he had never  conceived of a coherent purposive life  either one stayed in the  village  like a lodged stone  or one made random excursions into the  world  across the world  it was all aimless and purposeless     so he had stayed a while with his father  then he had gone  just as  aimlessly  with a party of men who were emigrating to america  he had  taken some money  had drifted about  living in the most comfortless   wretched fashion  then he had found a place somewhere in pennsylvania   in a dry goods store  this was when he was seventeen or eighteen  years old     all this seemed to have happened to him without his being very much  affected  at least consciously  his nature was simple and self complete   yet not so self complete as that of il duro or paolo  they had passed  through the foreign world and been quite untouched  their souls were  static  it was the world that had flowed unstable by     but john was more sensitive  he had come more into contact with his new  surroundings  he had attended night classes almost every evening  and  had been taught english like a child  he had loved the american free  school  the teachers  the work     but he had suffered very much in america  with his curious   over sensitive  wincing laugh  he told us how the boys had followed him  and jeered at him  calling after him   you damn dago  you damn dago    they had stopped him and his friend in the street and taken away their  hats  and spat into them  so that at last he had gone mad  they were  youths and men who always tortured him  using bad language which  startled us very much as he repeated it  there on the little lawn under  the olive trees  above the perfect lake  english obscenities and abuse  so coarse and startling that we bit our lips  shocked almost into  laughter  whilst john  simple and natural  and somehow  for all his long  hair and dirty appearance  flower like in soul  repeated to us these  things which may never be repeated in decent company      oh   he said   at last  i get mad  when they come one day  shouting    you damn dago  dirty dog   and will take my hat again  oh  i get mad   and i would kill them  i would kill them  i am so mad  i run to them   and throw one to the floor  and i tread on him while i go upon another   the biggest  though they hit me and kick me all over  i feel nothing  i  am mad  i throw the biggest to the floor  a man  he is older than i am   and i hit him so hard i would kill him  when the others see it they are  afraid  they throw stones and hit me on the face  but i don t feel it  i  don t know nothing  i hit the man on the floor  i almost kill him  i  forget everything except i will kill him        but you didn t       no  i don t know    and he laughed his queer  shaken laugh   the other  man that was with me  my friend  he came to me and we went away  oh  i  was mad  i was completely mad  i would have killed them      he was trembling slightly  and his eyes were dilated with a strange  greyish blue fire that was very painful and elemental  he looked beside  himself  but he was by no means mad     we were shaken by the vivid  lambent excitement of the youth  we wished  him to forget  we were shocked  too  in our souls to see the pure  elemental flame shaken out of his gentle  sensitive nature  by his  slight  crinkled laugh we could see how much he had suffered  he had  gone out and faced the world  and he had kept his place  stranger and  dago though he was      they never came after me no more  not all the while i was there      then he said he became the foreman in the store  at first he was only  assistant  it was the best store in the town  and many english ladies  came  and some germans  he liked the english ladies very much  they  always wanted him to be in the store  he wore white clothes there  and  they would say      you look very nice in the white coat  john   or else      let john come  he can find it   or else they said      john speaks like a born american      this pleased him very much     in the end  he said  he earned a hundred dollars a month  he lived with  the extraordinary frugality of the italians  and had quite a lot  of money     he was not like il duro  faustino had lived in a state of miserliness  almost in america  but then he had had his debauches of shows and wine  and carousals  john went chiefly to the schools  in one of which he was  even asked to teach italian  his knowledge of his own language was  remarkable and most unusual      but what   i asked   brought you back       it was my father  you see  if i did not come to have my military  service  i must stay till i am forty  so i think perhaps my father will  be dead  i shall never see him  so i came      he had come home when he was twenty to fulfil his military duties  at  home he had married  he was very fond of his wife  but he had no  conception of love in the old sense  his wife was like the past  to  which he was wedded  out of her he begot his child  as out of the past   but the future was all beyond her  apart from her  he was going away  again  now  to america  he had been some nine months at home after his  military service was over  he had no more to do  now he was leaving his  wife and child and his father to go to america      but why   i said   why  you are not poor  you can manage the shop in  your village       yes   he said   but i will go to america  perhaps i shall go into the  store again  the same       but is it not just the same as managing the shop at home       no  no  it is quite different      then he told us how he bought goods in brescia and in said for the shop  at home  how he had rigged up a funicular with the assistance of the  village  an overhead wire by which you could haul the goods up the face  of the cliffs right high up  to within a mile of the village  he was  very proud of this  and sometimes he himself went down the funicular to  the water s edge  to the boat  when he was in a hurry  this also  pleased him     but he was going to brescia this day to see about going again to  america  perhaps in another month he would be gone     it was a great puzzle to me why he would go  he could not say himself   he would stay four or five years  then he would come home again to see  his father  and his wife and child     there was a strange  almost frightening destiny upon him  which seemed  to take him away  always away from home  from the past  to that great   raw america  he seemed scarcely like a person with individual choice   more like a creature under the influence of fate which was  disintegrating the old life and precipitating him  a fragment  inconclusive  into the new chaos     he submitted to it all with a perfect unquestioning simplicity  never  even knowing that he suffered  that he must suffer disintegration from  the old life  he was moved entirely from within  he never questioned his  inevitable impulse      they say to me   don t go  don t go     he shook his head   but i say i  will go      and at that it was finished     so we saw him off at the little quay  going down the lake  he would  return at evening  and be pulled up in his funicular basket  and in a  month s time he would be standing on the same lake steamer going  to america     nothing was more painful than to see him standing there in his degraded   sordid american clothes  on the deck of the steamer  waving us good bye   belonging in his final desire to our world  the world of consciousness  and deliberate action  with his candid  open  unquestioning face  he  seemed like a prisoner being conveyed from one form of life to another   or like a soul in trajectory  that has not yet found a resting place     what were wife and child to him   they were the last steps of the past   his father was the continent behind him  his wife and child the  foreshore of the past  but his face was set outwards  away from it  all  whither  neither he nor anybody knew  but he called it america            italians in exile       when i was in constance the weather was misty and enervating and  depressing  it was no pleasure to travel on the big flat desolate lake     when i went from constance  it was on a small steamer down the rhine to  schaffhausen  that was beautiful  still  the mist hung over the waters   over the wide shallows of the river  and the sun  coming through the  morning  made lovely yellow lights beneath the bluish haze  so that it  seemed like the beginning of the world  and there was a hawk in the  upper air fighting with two crows  or two rooks  ever they rose higher  and higher  the crow flickering above the attacking hawk  the fight  going on like some strange symbol in the sky  the germans on deck  watching with pleasure     then we passed out of sight between wooded banks and under bridges where  quaint villages of old romance piled their red and coloured pointed  roofs beside the water  very still  remote  lost in the vagueness of the  past  it could not be that they were real  even when the boat put in to  shore  and the customs officials came to look  the village remained  remote in the romantic past of high germany  the germany of fairy tales  and minstrels and craftsmen  the poignancy of the past was almost  unbearable  floating there in colour upon the haze of the river     we went by some swimmers  whose white shadowy bodies trembled near the  side of the steamer under water  one man with a round  fair head lifted  his face and one arm from the water and shouted a greeting to us  as if  he were a niebelung  saluting with bright arm lifted from the water  his  face laughing  the fair moustache hanging over his mouth  then his white  body swirled in the water  and he was gone  swimming with the  side stroke     schaffhausen the town  half old and bygone  half modern  with breweries  and industries  that is not very real  schaffhausen falls  with their  factory in the midst and their hotel at the bottom  and the general  cinematograph effect  they are ugly     it was afternoon when i set out to walk from the falls to italy  across  switzerland  i remember the big  fat  rather gloomy fields of this part  of baden  damp and unliving  i remember i found some apples under a tree  in a field near a railway embankment  then some mushrooms  and i ate  both  then i came on to a long  desolate high road  with dreary   withered trees on either side  and flanked by great fields where groups  of men and women were working  they looked at me as i went by down the  long  long road  alone and exposed and out of the world     i remember nobody came at the border village to examine my pack  i  passed through unchallenged  all was quiet and lifeless and hopeless   with big stretches of heavy land     till sunset came  very red and purple  and suddenly  from the heavy  spacious open land i dropped sharply into the rhine valley again   suddenly  as if into another glamorous world     there was the river rushing along between its high  mysterious  romantic  banks  which were high as hills  and covered with vine  and there was  the village of tall  quaint houses flickering its lights on to the  deep flowing river  and quite silent  save for the rushing of water     there was a fine covered bridge  very dark  i went to the middle and  looked through the opening at the dark water below  at the facade of  square lights  the tall village front towering remote and silent above  the river  the hill rose on either side the flood  down here was a  small  forgotten  wonderful world that belonged to the date of isolated  village communities and wandering minstrels     so i went back to the inn of the golden stag  and  climbing some steps   i made a loud noise  a woman came  and i asked for food  she led me  through a room where were enormous barrels  ten feet in diameter  lying  fatly on their sides  then through a large stone clean kitchen  with  bright pans  ancient as the meistersinger  then up some steps and into  the long guest room  where a few tables were laid for supper     a few people were eating  i asked for abendessen  and sat by the window  looking at the darkness of the river below  the covered bridge  the dark  hill opposite  crested with its few lights     then i ate a very large quantity of knoedel soup and bread  and drank  beer  and was very sleepy  only one or two village men came in  and  these soon went again  the place was dead still  only at a long table on  the opposite side of the room were seated seven or eight men  ragged   disreputable  some impudent  another came in late  the landlady gave  them all thick soup with dumplings and bread and meat  serving them in a  sort of brief disapprobation  they sat at the long table  eight or nine  tramps and beggars and wanderers out of work and they ate with a sort of  cheerful callousness and brutality for the most part  and as if  ravenously  looking round and grinning sometimes  subdued  cowed  like  prisoners  and yet impudent  at the end one shouted to know where he was  to sleep  the landlady called to the young serving woman  and in a  classic german severity of disapprobation they were led up the stone  stairs to their room  they tramped off in threes and twos  making a bad   mean  humiliated exit  it was not yet eight o clock  the landlady sat  talking to one bearded man  staid and severe  whilst  with her work on  the table  she sewed steadily     as the beggars and wanderers went slinking out of the room  some called  impudently  cheerfully       nacht  frau wirtin  g nacht  wirtin   te nacht  frau    to all of  which the hostess answered a stereotyped   gute nacht    never turning  her head from her sewing  or indicating by the faintest movement that  she was addressing the men who were filing raggedly to the doorway     so the room was empty  save for the landlady and her sewing  the staid   elderly villager to whom she was talking in the unbeautiful dialect  and  the young serving woman who was clearing away the plates and basins of  the tramps and beggars     then the villager also went       gute nacht  frau seidl    to the landlady    gute nacht    at random   to me     so i looked at the newspaper  then i asked the landlady for a cigarette   not knowing how else to begin  so she came to my table  and we talked     it pleased me to take upon myself a sort of romantic  wandering  character  she said my german was   schoen    a little goes a long way     so i asked her who were the men who had sat at the long table  she  became rather stiff and curt      they are the men looking for work   she said  as if the subject were  disagreeable      but why do they come here  so many   i asked     then she told me that they were going out of the country  this was  almost the last village of the border  that the relieving officer in  each village was empowered to give to every vagrant a ticket entitling  the holder to an evening meal  bed  and bread in the morning  at a  certain inn  this was the inn for the vagrants coming to this village   the landlady received fourpence per head  i believe it was  for each of  these wanderers      little enough   i said      nothing   she replied     she did not like the subject at all  only her respect for me made her  answer       bettler  lumpen  und taugenichtse    i said cheerfully      and men who are out of work  and are going back to their own parish    she said stiffly     so we talked a little  and i too went to bed       gute nacht  frau wirtin         gute nacht  mein herr       so i went up more and more stone stairs  attended by the young woman  it  was a great  lofty  old deserted house  with many drab doors     at last  in the distant topmost floor  i had my bedroom  with two beds  and bare floor and scant furniture  i looked down at the river far  below  at the covered bridge  at the far lights on the hill above   opposite  strange to be here in this lost  forgotten place  sleeping  under the roof with tramps and beggars  i debated whether they would  steal my boots if i put them out  but i risked it  the door latch made a  loud noise on the deserted landing  everywhere felt abandoned   forgotten  i wondered where the eight tramps and beggars were asleep   there was no way of securing the door  but somehow i felt that  if i  were destined to be robbed or murdered  it would not be by tramps and  beggars  so i blew out the candle and lay under the big feather bed   listening to the running and whispering of the medieval rhine     and when i waked up again it was sunny  it was morning on the hill  opposite  though the river deep below ran in shadow     the tramps and beggars were all gone  they must be cleared out by seven  o clock in the morning  so i had the inn to myself  i  and the landlady   and the serving woman  everywhere was very clean  full of the german  morning energy and brightness  which is so different from the latin  morning  the italians are dead and torpid first thing  the germans are  energetic and cheerful     it was cheerful in the sunny morning  looking down on the swift river   the covered  picturesque bridge  the bank and the hill opposite  then  down the curving road of the facing hill the swiss cavalry came riding   men in blue uniforms  i went out to watch them  they came thundering  romantically through the dark cavern of the roofed in bridge  and they  dismounted at the entrance to the village  there was a fresh  morning cheerful newness everywhere  in the arrival of the troops  in  the welcome of the villagers     the swiss do not look very military  neither in accoutrement nor  bearing  this little squad of cavalry seemed more like a party of common  men riding out in some business of their own than like an army  they  were very republican and very free  the officer who commanded them was  one of themselves  his authority was by consent     it was all very pleasant and genuine  there was a sense of ease and  peacefulness  quite different from the mechanical  slightly sullen  manoeuvring of the germans     the village baker and his assistant came hot and floury from the  bakehouse  bearing between them a great basket of fresh bread  the  cavalry were all dismounted by the bridge head  eating and drinking like  business men  villagers came to greet their friends  one soldier kissed  his father  who came wearing a leathern apron  the school bell  tang tang tanged from above  school children merged timidly through the  grouped horses  up the narrow street  passing unwillingly with their  books  the river ran swiftly  the soldiers  very haphazard and slack in  uniform  real shack bags  chewed their bread in large mouthfuls  the  young lieutenant  who seemed to be an officer only by consent of the  men  stood apart by the bridge head  gravely  they were all serious and  self contented  very unglamorous  it was like a business excursion on  horseback  harmless and uninspiring  the uniforms were almost ludicrous   so ill fitting and casual     so i shouldered my own pack and set off  through the bridge over the  rhine  and up the hill opposite     there is something very dead about this country  i remember i picked  apples from the grass by the roadside  and some were very sweet  but for  the rest  there was mile after mile of dead  uninspired  country  uninspired  so neutral and ordinary that it was almost  destructive     one gets this feeling always in switzerland  except high up  this  feeling of average  of utter soulless ordinariness  something  intolerable  mile after mile  to zurich  it was just the same  it was  just the same in the tram car going into zurich  it was just the same in  the town  in the shops  in the restaurant  all was the utmost level of  ordinariness and well being  but so ordinary that it was like a blight   all the picturesqueness of the town is nothing  it is like a most  ordinary  average  usual person in an old costume  the place was  soul killing     so after two hours  rest  eating in a restaurant  wandering by the quay  and through the market  and sitting on a seat by the lake  i found a  steamer that would take me away  that is how i always feel in  switzerland  the only possible living sensation is the sensation of  relief in going away  always going away  the horrible average  ordinariness of it all  something utterly without flower or soul or  transcendence  the horrible vigorous ordinariness  is too much     so i went on a steamer down the long lake  surrounded by low grey hills   it was saturday afternoon  a thin rain came on  i thought i would rather  be in fiery hell than in this dead level of average life     i landed somewhere on the right bank  about three quarters of the way  down the lake  it was almost dark  yet i must walk away  i climbed a  long hill from the lake  came to the crest  looked down the darkness of  the valley  and descended into the deep gloom  down into a  soulless village     but it was eight o clock  and i had had enough  one might as well sleep   i found the gasthaus zur post     it was a small  very rough inn  having only one common room  with bare  tables  and a short  stout  grim  rather surly landlady  and a landlord  whose hair stood up on end  and who was trembling on the edge of  delirium tremens     they could only give me boiled ham  so i ate boiled ham and drank beer   and tried to digest the utter cold materialism of switzerland     as i sat with my back to the wall  staring blankly at the trembling  landlord  who was ready at any moment to foam at the mouth  and at the  dour landlady  who was quite capable of keeping him in order  there came  in one of those dark  showy italian girls with a man  she wore a blouse  and skirt  and no hat  her hair was perfectly dressed  it was really  italy  the man was soft  dark  he would get stout later   trapu   he  would have somewhat the figure of caruso  but as yet he was soft   sensuous  young  handsome     they sat at the long side table with their beer  and created another  country at once within the room  another italian came  fair and fat and  slow  one from the venetian province  then another  a little thin young  man  who might have been a swiss save for his vivid movement     this last was the first to speak to the germans  the others had just  said   bier    but the little newcomer entered into a conversation with  the landlady     at last there were six italians sitting talking loudly and warmly at the  side table  the slow  cold german swiss at the other tables looked at  them occasionally  the landlord  with his crazed  stretched eyes  glared  at them with hatred  but they fetched their beer from the bar with easy  familiarity  and sat at their table  creating a bonfire of life in the  callousness of the inn     at last they finished their beer and trooped off down the passage  the  room was painfully empty  i did not know what to do     then i heard the landlord yelling and screeching and snarling from the  kitchen at the back  for all the world like a mad dog  but the swiss  saturday evening customers at the other tables smoked on and talked in  their ugly dialect  without trouble  then the landlady came in  and soon  after the landlord  he collarless  with his waistcoat unbuttoned   showing his loose throat  and accentuating his round pot belly  his  limbs were thin and feverish  the skin of his face hung loose  his eyes  glaring  his hands trembled  then he sat down to talk to a crony  his  terrible appearance was a fiasco  nobody heeded him at all  only the  landlady was surly     from the back came loud noises of pleasure and excitement and banging  about  when the room door was opened i could see down the dark passage  opposite another lighted door  then the fat  fair italian came in for  more beer      what is all the noise   i asked the landlady at last      it is the italians   she said      what are they doing       they are doing a play       where      she jerked her head   in the room at the back       can i go and look at them       i should think so      the landlord glaringly watched me go out  i went down the stone passage  and found a great  half lighted room that might be used to hold  meetings  with forms piled at the side  at one end was raised platform  or stage  and on this stage was a table and a lamp  and the italians  grouped round the light  gesticulating and laughing  their beer mugs  were on the table and on the floor of the stage  the little sharp youth  was intently looking over some papers  the others were bending over the  table with him     they looked up as i entered from the distance  looked at me in the  distant twilight of the dusky room  as if i were an intruder  as if i  should go away when i had seen them  but i said in german      may i look      they were still unwilling to see or to hear me      what do you say   the small one asked in reply     the others stood and watched  slightly at bay  like suspicious animals      if i might come and look   i said in german  then  feeling very  uncomfortable  in italian   you are doing a drama  the landlady  told me      the big empty room was behind me  dark  the little company of italians  stood above me in the light of the lamp which was on the table  they all  watched with unseeing  unwilling looks  i was merely an intrusion      we are only learning it   said the small youth     they wanted me to go away  but i wanted to stay      may i listen   i said   i don t want to stay in there   and i  indicated  with a movement of the head  the inn room beyond      yes   said the young intelligent man   but we are only reading our  parts      they had all become more friendly to me  they accepted me      you are a german   asked one youth      no  english       english  but do you live in switzerland       no  i am walking to italy       on foot      they looked with wakened eyes      yes      so i told them about my journey  they were puzzled  they did not quite  understand why i wanted to walk  but they were delighted with the idea  of going to lugano and como and then to milan      where do you come from   i asked them     they were all from the villages between verona and venice  they had seen  the garda  i told them of my living there      those peasants of the mountains   they said at once   they are people  of little education  rather wild folk      and they spoke with good humoured contempt     i thought of paolo  and il duro  and the signor pietro  our padrone  and  i resented these factory hands for criticizing them     so i sat on the edge of the stage whilst they rehearsed their parts  the  little thin intelligent fellow  giuseppino  was the leader  the others  read their parts in the laborious  disjointed fashion of the peasant   who can only see one word at a time  and has then to put the words  together  afterwards  to make sense  the play was an amateur melodrama   printed in little penny booklets  for carnival production  this was only  the second reading they had given it  and the handsome  dark fellow  who  was roused and displaying himself before the girl  a hard  erect piece  of callousness  laughed and flushed and stumbled  and understood nothing  till it was transferred into him direct through giuseppino  the fat   fair  slow man was more conscientious  he laboured through his part  the  other two men were in the background more or less     the most confidential was the fat  fair  slow man  who was called  alberto  his part was not very important  so he could sit by me and  talk to me     he said they were all workers in the factory  silk  i think it was  in  the village  they were a whole colony of italians  thirty or more  families  they had all come at different times     giuseppino had been longest in the village  he had come when he was  eleven  with his parents  and had attended the swiss school  so he spoke  perfect german  he was a clever man  was married  and had two children     he himself  alberto  had been seven years in the valley  the girl  la  maddelena  had been here ten years  the dark man  alfredo  who was  flushed with excitement of her  had been in the village about nine  years  he alone of all men was not married     the others had all married italian wives  and they lived in the great  dwelling whose windows shone yellow by the rattling factory  they lived  entirely among themselves  none of them could speak german  more than a  few words  except the giuseppino  who was like a native here     it was very strange being among these italians exiled in switzerland   alfredo  the dark one  the unmarried  was in the old tradition  yet even  he was curiously subject to a new purpose  as if there were some greater  new will that included him  sensuous  mindless as he was  he seemed to  give his consent to something beyond himself  in this he was different  from il duro  in that he had put himself under the control of the  outside conception     it was strange to watch them on the stage  the italians all lambent   soft  warm  sensuous  yet moving subject round giuseppino  who was  always quiet  always ready  always impersonal  there was a look of  purpose  almost of devotion on his face  that singled him out and made  him seem the one stable  eternal being among them  they quarrelled  and  he let them quarrel up to a certain point  then he called them back  he  let them do as they liked so long as they adhered more or less to the  central purpose  so long as they got on in some measure with the play     all the while they were drinking beer and smoking cigarettes  the  alberto was barman  he went out continually with the glasses  the  maddelena had a small glass  in the lamplight of the stage the little  party read and smoked and practised  exposed to the empty darkness of  the big room  queer and isolated it seemed  a tiny  pathetic magicland  far away from the barrenness of switzerland  i could believe in the old  fairy tales where  when the rock was opened  a magic underworld  was revealed     the alfredo  flushed  roused  handsome  but very soft and enveloping in  his heat  laughed and threw himself into his pose  laughed foolishly   and then gave himself up to his part  the alberto  slow and laborious   yet with a spark of vividness and natural intensity flashing through   replied and gesticulated  the maddelena laid her head on the bosom of  alfredo  the other men started into action  and the play proceeded  intently for half an hour     quick  vivid  and sharp  the little giuseppino was always central  but  he seemed almost invisible  when i think back  i can scarcely see him  i  can only see the others  the lamplight on their faces and on their full  gesticulating limbs  i can see  the maddelena  rather coarse and hard  and repellent  declaiming her words in a loud  half cynical voice   falling on the breast of the alfredo  who was soft and sensuous  more  like a female  flushing  with his mouth getting wet  his eyes moist  as  he was roused  i can see the alberto  slow  laboured  yet with a kind of  pristine simplicity in all his movements  that touched his fat  commonplaceness with beauty  then there were the two other men  shy   inflammable  unintelligent  with their sudden italian rushes of hot  feeling  all their faces are distinct in the lamplight  all their bodies  ate palpable and dramatic     but the face of the giuseppino is like a pale luminousness  a sort of  gleam among all the ruddy glow  his body is evanescent  like a shadow   and his being seemed to cast its influence over all the others  except  perhaps the woman  who was hard and resistant  the other men seemed all  overcast  mitigated  in part transfigured by the will of the little  leader  but they were very soft stuff  if inflammable     the young woman of the inn  niece of the landlady  came down and called  out across the room      we will go away from here now   said the giuseppino to me   they close  at eleven  but we have another inn in the next parish that is open all  night  come with us and drink some wine       but   i said   you would rather be alone      no  they pressed me to go  they wanted me to go with them  they were  eager  they wanted to entertain me  alfredo  flushed  wet mouthed  warm   protested i must drink wine  the real italian red wine  from their own  village at home  they would have no nay     so i told the landlady  she said i must be back by twelve o clock     the night was very dark  below the road the stream was rushing  there  was a great factory on the other side of the water  making faint  quivering lights of reflection  and one could see the working of  machinery shadowy through the lighted windows  near by was the tall  tenement where the italians lived     we went on through the straggling  raw village  deep beside the stream   then over the small bridge  and up the steep hill down which i had come  earlier in the evening     so we arrived at the cafe  it was so different inside from the german  inn  yet it was not like an italian cafe either  it was brilliantly  lighted  clean  new  and there were red and white cloths on the tables   the host was in the room  and his daughter  a beautiful red haired girl     greetings were exchanged with the quick  intimate directness of italy   but there was another note also  a faint echo of reserve  as though they  reserved themselves from the outer world  making a special inner  community     alfredo was hot  he took off his coat  we all sat freely at a long  table  whilst the red haired girl brought a quart of red wine  at other  tables men were playing cards  with the odd neapolitan cards  they too  were talking italian  it was a warm  ruddy bit of italy within the cold  darkness of switzerland      when you come to italy   they said to me   salute it from us  salute  the sun  and the earth   l italia       so we drank in salute of italy  they sent their greeting by me      you know in italy there is the sun  the sun   said alfredo to me   profoundly moved  wet mouthed  tipsy     i was reminded of enrico persevalli and his terrifying cry at the end of   ghosts        il sole  il sole       so we talked for a while of italy  they had a pained tenderness for it   sad  reserved      don t you want to go back   i said  pressing them to tell me  definitely   won t you go back some time       yes   they said   we will go back      but they spoke reservedly  without freedom  we talked about italy  about  songs  and carnival  about the food  polenta  and salt  they laughed at  my pretending to cut the slabs of polenta with a string  that rejoiced  them all  it took them back to the italian mezzo giorno  the bells  jangling in the campanile  the eating after the heavy work on the land     but they laughed with the slight pain and contempt and fondness which  every man feels towards his past  when he has struggled away from that  past  from the conditions which made it     they loved italy passionately  but they would not go back  all their  blood  all their senses were italian  needed the italian sky  the  speech  the sensuous life  they could hardly live except through the  senses  their minds were not developed  mentally they were children   lovable  naive  almost fragile children  but sensually they were men   sensually they were accomplished     yet a new tiny flower was struggling to open in them  the flower of a  new spirit  the substratum of italy has always been pagan  sensuous  the  most potent symbol the sexual symbol  the child is really a  non christian symbol  it is the symbol of mans s triumph of eternal life  in procreation  the worship of the cross never really held good in  italy  the christianity of northern europe has never had any  place there     and now  when northern europe is turning back on its own christianity   denying it all  the italians are struggling with might and main against  the sensuous spirit which still dominates them  when northern europe   whether it hates nietzsche or not  is crying out for the dionysic  ecstasy  practising on itself the dionysic ecstasy  southern europe is  breaking free from dionysus  from the triumphal affirmation of life over  death  immortality through procreation     i could see these sons of italy would never go back  men like paolo and  il duro broke away only to return  the dominance of the old form was too  strong for them  call it love of country or love of the village   campanilismo  or what not  it was the dominance of the old pagan form   the old affirmation of immortality through procreation  as opposed to  the christian affirmation of immortality through self death and  social love     but  john  and these italians in switzerland were a generation younger   and they would not go back  at least not to the old italy  suffer as  they might  and they did suffer  wincing in every nerve and fibre from  the cold material insentience of the northern countries and of america   still they would endure this for the sake of something else they wanted   they would suffer a death in the flesh  as  john  had suffered in  fighting the street crowd  as these men suffered year after year cramped  in their black gloomy cold swiss valley  working in the factory  but  there would come a new spirit out of it     even alfredo was submitted to the new process  though he belonged  entirely by nature to the sort of il duro  he was purely sensuous and  mindless  but under the influence of giuseppino he was thrown down  as  fallow to the new spirit that would come     and then  when the others were all partially tipsy  the giuseppino began  to talk to me  in him was a steady flame burning  burning  burning  a  flame of the mind  of the spirit  something new and clear  something  that held even the soft  sensuous alfredo in submission  besides all the  others  who had some little development of mind       sa signore    said the giuseppino to me  quiet  almost invisible or  inaudible  as it seemed  like a spirit addressing me    l uomo non ha  patria   a man has no country  what has the italian government to do  with us  what does a government mean  it makes us work  it takes part of  our wages away from us  it makes us soldiers  and what for  what is  government for       have you been a soldier   i interrupted him     he had not  none of them had  that was why they could not really go back  to italy  now this was out  this explained partly their curious  reservation in speaking about their beloved country  they had forfeited  parents as well as homeland      what does the government do  it takes taxes  it has an army and police   and it makes roads  but we could do without an army  and we could be our  own police  and we could make our own roads  what is this government   who wants it  only those who are unjust  and want to have advantage over  somebody else  it is an instrument of injustice and of wrong      why should we have a government  here  in this village  there are  thirty families of italians  there is no government for them  no italian  government  and we live together better than in italy  we are richer and  freer  we have no policemen  no poor laws  we help each other  and there  are no poor      why are these governments always doing what we don t want them to do   we should not be fighting in the cirenaica if we were all italians  it  is the government that does it  they talk and talk and do things with  us  but we don t want them      the others  tipsy  sat round the table with the terrified gravity of  children who are somehow responsible for things they do not understand   they stirred in their seats  turning aside  with gestures almost of  pain  of imprisonment  only alfredo  laying his hand on mine  was  laughing  loosely  floridly  he would upset all the government with a  jerk of his well built shoulder  and then he would have a spree  such a  spree  he laughed wetly to me     the giuseppino waited patiently during this tipsy confidence  but his  pale clarity and beauty was something constant star like in comparison  with the flushed  soft handsomeness of the other  he waited patiently   looking at me     but i did not want him to go on  i did not want to answer  i could feel  a new spirit in him  something strange and pure and slightly  frightening  he wanted something which was beyond me  and my soul was  somewhere in tears  crying helplessly like an infant in the night  i  could not respond  i could not answer  he seemed to look at me  me  an  englishman  an educated man  for corroboration  but i could not  corroborate him  i knew the purity and new struggling towards birth of a  true star like spirit  but i could not confirm him in his utterance  my  soul could not respond  i did not believe in the perfectibility of man   i did not believe in infinite harmony among men  and this was his star   this belief     it was nearly midnight  a swiss came in and asked for beer  the italians  gathered round them a curious darkness of reserve  and then i must go     they shook hands with me warmly  truthfully  putting a sort of implicit  belief in me  as representative of some further knowledge  but there was  a fixed  calm resolve over the face of the giuseppino  a sort of steady  faith  even in disappointment  he gave me a copy of a little anarchist  paper published in geneva   l anarchista   i believe it was called  i  glanced at it  it was in italian  naive  simple  rather rhetorical  so  they were all anarchists  these italians     i ran down the hill in the thick swiss darkness to the little bridge   and along the uneven cobbled street  i did not want to think  i did not  want to know  i wanted to arrest my activity  to keep it confined to the  moment  to the adventure     when i came to the flight of stone steps which led up to the door of the  inn  at the side i saw in the darkness two figures  they said a low good  night and parted  the girl began to knock at the door  the man  disappeared  it was the niece of the landlady parting from her lover     we waited outside the locked door  at the top of the stone steps  in the  darkness of midnight  the stream rustled below  then came a shouting and  an insane snarling within the passage  the bolts were not withdrawn      it is the gentleman  it is the strange gentleman   called the girl     then came again the furious shouting snarls  and the landlord s mad  voice      stop out  stop out there  the door won t be opened again       the strange gentleman is here   repeated the girl     then more movement was heard  and the door was suddenly opened  and the  landlord rushed out upon us  wielding a broom  it was a strange sight   in the half lighted passage  i stared blankly in the doorway  the  landlord dropped the broom he was waving and collapsed as if by magic   looking at me  though he continued to mutter madly  unintelligibly  the  girl slipped past me  and the landlord snarled  then he picked up the  brush  at the same time crying      you are late  the door was shut  it will not be opened  we shall have  the police in the house  we said twelve o clock  at twelve o clock the  door must be shut  and must not be opened again  if you are late you  stay out       so he went snarling  his voice rising higher and higher  away into the  kitchen      you are coming to your room   the landlady said to me coldly  and she  led me upstairs     the room was over the road  clean  but rather ugly  with a large tin   that had once contained lard or swiss milk  to wash in  but the bed was  good enough  which was all that mattered     i heard the landlord yelling  and there was a long and systematic  thumping somewhere  thump  thump  thump  and banging  i wondered where  it was  i could not locate it at all  because my room lay beyond another  large room  i had to go through a large room  by the foot of two beds   to get to my door  so i could not quite tell where anything was     but i went to sleep whilst i was wondering     i woke in the morning and washed in the tin  i could see a few people in  the street  walking in the sunday morning leisure  it felt like sunday  in england  and i shrank from it  i could see none of the italians  the  factory stood there  raw and large and sombre  by the stream  and the  drab coloured stone tenements were close by  otherwise the village was a  straggling swiss street  almost untouched     the landlord was quiet and reasonable  even friendly  in the morning  he  wanted to talk to me  where had i bought my boots  was his first  question  i told him in munich  and how much had they cost  i told him  twenty eight marks  he was much impressed by them  such good boots  of  such soft  strong  beautiful leather  he had not seen such boots for a  long time     then i knew it was he who had cleaned my boots  i could see him  fingering them and wondering over them  i rather liked him  i could see  he had had imagination once  and a certain fineness of nature  now he  was corrupted with drink  too far gone to be even a human being  i hated  the village     they set bread and butter and a piece of cheese weighing about five  pounds  and large  fresh  sweet cakes for breakfast  i ate and was  thankful  the food was good     a couple of village youths came in  in their sunday clothes  they had  the sunday stiffness  it reminded me of the stiffness and curious  self consciousness that comes over life in england on a sunday  but the  landlord sat with his waistcoat hanging open over his shirt   pot bellied  his ruined face leaning forward  talking  always talking   wanting to know     so in a few minutes i was out on the road again  thanking god for the  blessing of a road that belongs to no man  and travels away from  all men     i did not want to see the italians  something had got tied up in me  and  i could not bear to see them again  i liked them so much  but  for some  reason or other  my mind stopped like clockwork if i wanted to think of  them and of what their lives would be  their future  it was as if some  curious negative magnetism arrested my mind  prevented it from working   the moment i turned it towards these italians     i do not know why it was  but i could never write to them  or think of  them  or even read the paper they gave me though it lay in my drawer for  months  in italy  and i often glanced over six lines of it  and often   often my mind went back to the group  the play they were rehearsing  the  wine in the pleasant cafe  and the night  but the moment my memory  touched them  my whole soul stopped and was null  i could not go on   even now i cannot really consider them in thought     i shrink involuntarily away  i do not know why this is            the return journey       when one walks  one must travel west or south  if one turns northward or  eastward it is like walking down a cul de sac  to the blind end     so it has been since the crusaders came home satiated  and the  renaissance saw the western sky as an archway into the future  so it is  still  we must go westwards and southwards     it is a sad and gloomy thing to travel even from italy into france  but  it is a joyful thing to walk south to italy  south and west  it is so   and there is a certain exaltation in the thought of going west  even to  cornwall  to ireland  it is as if the magnetic poles were south west and  north east  for our spirits  with the south west  under the sunset  as  the positive pole  so whilst i walk through switzerland  though it is a  valley of gloom and depression  a light seems to flash out under every  footstep  with the joy of progression     it was sunday morning when i left the valley where the italians lived  i  went quickly over the stream  heading for lucerne  it was a good thing  to be out of doors  with one s pack on one s back  climbing uphill  but  the trees were thick by the roadside  i was not yet free  it was sunday  morning  very still     in two hours i was at the top of the hill  looking out over the  intervening valley at the long lake of zurich  spread there beyond with  its girdle of low hills  like a relief map  i could not bear to look at  it  it was so small and unreal  i had a feeling as if it were false  a  large relief map that i was looking down upon  and which i wanted to  smash  it seemed to intervene between me and some reality  i could not  believe that that was the real world  it was a figment  a fabrication   like a dull landscape painted on a wall  to hide the real landscape     so i went on  over to the other side of the hill  and i looked out  again  again there were the smoky looking hills and the lake like a  piece of looking glass  but the hills were higher  that big one was the  rigi  i set off down the hill     there was fat agricultural land and several villages  and church was  over  the churchgoers were all coming home  men in black broadcloth and  old chimney pot silk hats  carrying their umbrellas  women in ugly  dresses  carrying books and umbrellas  the streets were dotted with  these black clothed men and stiff women  all reduced to a sunday  nullity  i hated it  it reminded me of that which i knew in my boyhood   that stiff  null  propriety  which used to come over us  like a sort of  deliberate and self inflicted cramp  on sundays  i hated these elders in  black broadcloth  with their neutral faces  going home piously to their  sunday dinners  i hated the feeling of these villages  comfortable   well to do  clean  and proper     and my boot was chafing two of my toes  that always happens  i had come  down to a wide  shallow valley bed  marshy  so about a mile out of the  village i sat down by a stone bridge  by a stream  and tore up my  handkerchief  and bound up the toes  and as i sat binding my toes  two  of the elders in black  with umbrellas under their arms  approached from  the direction of the village     they made me so furious  i had to hasten to fasten my boot  to hurry on  again  before they should come near me  i could not bear the way they  walked and talked  so crambling and material and mealy mouthed     then it did actually begin to rain  i was just going down a short hill   so i sat under a bush and watched the trees drip  i was so glad to be  there  homeless  without place or belonging  crouching under the leaves  in the copse by the road  that i felt i had  like the meek  inherited  the earth  some men went by  with their coat collars turned up  and the  rain making still blacker their black broadcloth shoulders  they did not  see me  i was as safe and separate as a ghost  so i ate the remains of  my food that i had bought in zurich  and waited for the rain     later  in the wet sunday afternoon  i went on to the little lake  past  many inert  neutral  material people  down an ugly road where trams ran   the blight of sunday was almost intolerable near the town     so on i went  by the side of the steamy  reedy lake  walking the length  of it  then suddenly i went in to a little villa by the water for tea   in switzerland every house is a villa     but this villa  was kept by two old ladies and a delicate dog  who must  not get his feet wet  i was very happy there  i had good jam and strange  honey cakes for tea  that i liked  and the little old ladies pattered  round in a great stir  always whirling like two dry leaves after the  restless dog      why must he not go out   i said      because it is wet   they answered   and he coughs and sneezes       without a handkerchief  that is not  angenehm   i said     so we became bosom friends      you are austrian   they said to me     i said i was from graz  that my father was a doctor in graz  and that i  was walking for my pleasure through the countries of europe     i said this because i knew a doctor from graz who was always wandering  about  and because i did not want to be myself  an englishman  to these  two old ladies  i wanted to be something else  so we exchanged  confidences     they told me  in their queer  old  toothless fashion  about their  visitors  a man who used to fish all day  every day for three weeks   fish every hour of the day  though many a day he caught nothing  nothing  at all  still he fished from the boat  and so on  such trivialities   then they told me of a third sister who had died  a third little old  lady  one could feel the gap in the house  they cried  and i  being an  austrian from graz  to my astonishment felt my tears slip over on to the  table  i also  was  sorry  and i would have kissed the little old ladies  to comfort them      only in heaven it is warm  and it doesn t rain  and no one dies   i  said  looking at the wet leaves     then i went away  i would have stayed the night at this house  i wanted  to  but i had developed my austrian character too far     so i went on to a detestable brutal inn in the town  and the next day i  climbed over the back of the detestable rigi  with its vile hotel  to  come to lucerne  there  on the rigi  i met a lost young frenchman who  could speak no german  and who said he could not find people to speak  french  so we sat on a stone and became close friends  and i promised  faithfully to go and visit him in his barracks in algiers  i was to sail  from naples to algiers  he wrote me the address on his card  and told me  he had friends in the regiment  to whom i should be introduced  and we  could have a good time  if i would stay a week or two  down there  in algiers     how much more real algiers was than the rock on the rigi where we sat   or the lake beneath  or the mountains beyond  algiers is very real   though i have never seen it  and my friend is my friend for ever  though  i have lost his card and forgotten his name  he was a government clerk  from lyons  making this his first foreign tour before he began his  military service  he showed me his  circular excursion ticket   then at  last we parted  for he must get to the top of the rigi  and i must get  to the bottom     lucerne and its lake were as irritating as ever  like the wrapper round  milk chocolate  i could not sleep even one night there  i took the  steamer down the lake  to the very last station  there i found a good  german inn  and was happy     there was a tall thin young man  whose face was red and inflamed from  the sun  i thought he was a german tourist  he had just come in  and he  was eating bread and milk  he and i were alone in the eating room  he  was looking at an illustrated paper      does the steamer stop here all night   i asked him in german  hearing  the boat bustling and blowing her steam on the water outside  and  glancing round at her lights  red and white  in the pitch darkness     he only shook his head over his bread and milk  and did not lift his  face      are you english  then   i said     no one but an englishman would have hidden his face in a bowl of milk   and have shaken his red ears in such painful confusion      yes   he said   i am      and i started almost out of my skin at the unexpected london accent  it  was as if one suddenly found oneself in the tube      so am i   i said   where have you come from      then he began  like a general explaining his plans  to tell me  he had  walked round over the furka pass  had been on foot four or five days  he  had walked tremendously  knowing no german  and nothing of the  mountains  he had set off alone on this tour  he had a fortnight s  holiday  so he had come over the rhone glacier across the furka and down  from andermatt to the lake  on this last day he had walked about thirty  mountain miles      but weren t you tired   i said  aghast     he was  under the inflamed redness of his sun  and wind  and snow burned  face he was sick with fatigue  he had done over a hundred miles in the  last four days      did you enjoy it   i asked      oh yes  i wanted to do it all   he wanted to do it  and he  had  done  it  but god knows what he wanted to do it for  he had now one day at  lucerne  one day at interlaken and berne  then london     i was sorry for him in my soul  he was so cruelly tired  so perishingly  victorious      why did you do so much   i said   why did you come on foot all down the  valley when you could have taken the train  was it worth it       i think so   he said     yet he was sick with fatigue and over exhaustion  his eyes were quite  dark  sightless  he seemed to have lost the power of seeing  to be  virtually blind  he hung his head forward when he had to write a post  card  as if he felt his way  but he turned his post card so that i  should not see to whom it was addressed  not that i was interested  only  i noticed his little  cautious  english movement of privacy      what time will you be going on   i asked      when is the first steamer   he said  and he turned out a guide book  with a time table  he would leave at about seven      but why so early   i said to him     he must be in lucerne at a certain hour  and at interlaken in the  evening      i suppose you will rest when you get to london   i said     he looked at me quickly  reservedly     i was drinking beer  i asked him wouldn t he have something  he thought  a moment  then said he would have another glass of hot milk  the  landlord came   and bread   he asked     the englishman refused  he could not eat  really  also he was poor  he  had to husband his money  the landlord brought the milk and asked me   when would the gentleman want to go away  so i made arrangements between  the landlord and the stranger  but the englishman was slightly  uncomfortable at my intervention  he did not like me to know what he  would have for breakfast     i could feel so well the machine that had him in its grip  he slaved for  a year  mechanically  in london  riding in the tube  working in the  office  then for a fortnight he was let free  so he rushed to  switzerland  with a tour planned out  and with just enough money to see  him through  and to buy presents at interlaken  bits of the edelweiss  pottery  i could see him going home with them     so he arrived  and with amazing  pathetic courage set forth on foot in a  strange land  to face strange landlords  with no language but english at  his command  and his purse definitely limited  yet he wanted to go among  the mountains  to cross a glacier  so he had walked on and on  like one  possessed  ever forward  his name might have been excelsior  indeed     but then  when he reached his furka  only to walk along the ridge and to  descend on the same side  my god  it was killing to the soul  and here  he was  down again from the mountains  beginning his journey home again   steamer and train and steamer and train and tube  till he was back in  the machine     it hadn t let him go  and he knew it  hence his cruel self torture of  fatigue  his cruel exercise of courage  he who hung his head in his milk  in torment when i asked him a question in german  what courage had he  not needed to take this his very first trip out of england  alone   on foot     his eyes were dark and deep with unfathomable courage  yet he was going  back in the morning  he was going back  all he had courage for was to go  back  he would go back  though he died by inches  why not  it was  killing him  it was like living loaded with irons  but he had the  courage to submit  to die that way  since it was the way allotted  to him     the way he sank on the table in exhaustion  drinking his milk  his will   nevertheless  so perfect and unblemished  triumphant  though his body  was broken and in anguish  was almost too much to bear  my heart was  wrung for my countryman  wrung till it bled     i could not bear to understand my countryman  a man who worked for his  living  as i had worked  as nearly all my countrymen work  he would not  give in  on his holiday he would walk  to fulfil his purpose  walk on   no matter how cruel the effort were  he would not rest  he would not  relinquish his purpose nor abate his will  not by one jot or tittle  his  body must pay whatever his will demanded  though it were torture     it all seemed to me so foolish  i was almost in tears  he went to bed  i  walked by the dark lake  and talked to the girl in the inn  she was a  pleasant girl  it was a pleasant inn  a homely place  one could be  happy there     in the morning it was sunny  the lake was blue  by night i should be  nearly at the crest of my journey  i was glad     the englishman had gone  i looked for his name in the book  it was  written in a fair  clerkly hand  he lived at streatham  suddenly i hated  him  the dogged fool  to keep his nose on the grindstone like that  what  was all his courage but the very tip top of cowardice  what a vile  nature  almost sadish  proud  like the infamous red indians  of being  able to stand torture     the landlord came to talk to me  he was fat and comfortable and too  respectful  but i had to tell him all the englishman had done  in the  way of a holiday  just to shame his own fat  ponderous  inn keeper s  luxuriousness that was too gross  then all i got out of his enormous  comfortableness was      yes  that s a  very  long step to take      so i set off myself  up the valley between the close  snow topped  mountains  whose white gleamed above me as i crawled  small as an  insect  along the dark  cold valley below     there had been a cattle fair earlier in the morning  so troops of cattle  were roving down the road  some with bells tang tanging  all with soft  faces and startled eyes and a sudden swerving of horns  the grass was  very green by the roads and by the streams  the shadows of the mountain  slopes were very dark on either hand overhead  and the sky with snowy  flanks and tips was high up     here  away from the world  the villages were quiet and obscure  left  behind  they had the same fascinating atmosphere of being forgotten   left out of the world  that old english villages have  and buying apples  and cheese and bread in a little shop that sold everything and smelled  of everything  i felt at home again     but climbing gradually higher  mile after mile  always between the  shadows of the high mountains  i was glad i did not live in the alps   the villages on the slopes  the people there  seemed  as if they  must   gradually  bit by bit  slide down and tumble to the water course  and be  rolled on away  away to the sea  straggling  haphazard little villages  ledged on the slope  high up  beside their wet  green  hanging meadows   with pine trees behind and the valley bottom far below  and rocks right  above  on both sides  seemed like little temporary squattings of outcast  people  it seemed impossible that they should persist there  with great  shadows wielded over them  like a menace  and gleams of brief sunshine   like a window  there was a sense of momentariness and expectation  it  seemed as though some dramatic upheaval must take place  the mountains  fall down into their own shadows  the valley beds were like deep graves   the sides of the mountains like the collapsing walls of a grave  the  very mountain tops above  bright with transcendent snow  seemed like  death  eternal death     there  it seemed  in the glamorous snow  was the source of death  which  fell down in great waves of shadow and rock  rushing to the level earth   and all the people of the mountains  on the slopes  in the valleys   seemed to live upon this great  rushing wave of death  of breaking down   of destruction     the very pure source of breaking down  decomposition  the very quick of  cold death  is the snowy mountain peak above  there  eternally  goes on  the white foregathering of the crystals  out of the deathly cold of the  heavens  this is the static nucleus where death meets life in its  elementality  and thence  from their white  radiant nucleus of death in  life  flows the great flux downwards  towards life and warmth  and we  below  we cannot think of the flux upwards  that flows from the  needle point of snow to the unutterable cold and death     the people under the mountains  they seem to live in the flux of death   the last  strange  overshadowed units of life  big shadows wave over  them  there is the eternal noise of water falling icily downwards from  the source of death overhead     and the people under the shadows  dwelling in the tang of snow and the  noise of icy water  seem dark  almost sordid  brutal  there is no  flowering or coming to flower  only this persistence  in the ice touched  air  of reproductive life     but it is difficult to get a sense of a native population  everywhere  are the hotels and the foreigners  the parasitism  yet there is  unseen   this overshadowed  overhung  sordid mountain population  ledged on the  slopes and in the crevices  in the wider valleys there is still a sense  of cowering among the people  but they catch a new tone from their  contact with the foreigners  and in the towns are nothing but  tradespeople     so i climbed slowly up  for a whole day  first along the highroad   sometimes above and sometimes below the twisting  serpentine railway   then afterwards along a path on the side of the hill  a path that went  through the crew yards of isolated farms and even through the garden of  a village priest  the priest was decorating an archway  he stood on a  chair in the sunshine  reaching up with a garland  whilst the  serving woman stood below  talking loudly     the valley here seemed wider  the great flanks of the mountains gave  place  the peaks above were further back  so one was happier  i was  pleased as i sat by the thin track of single flat stones that dropped  swiftly downhill     at the bottom was a little town with a factory or quarry  or a foundry   some place with long  smoking chimneys  which made me feel quite at home  among the mountains     it is the hideous rawness of the world of men  the horrible  desolating  harshness of the advance of the industrial world upon the world of  nature  that is so painful  it looks as though the industrial spread of  mankind were a sort of dry disintegration advancing and advancing  a  process of dry disintegration  if only we could learn to take thought  for the whole world instead of for merely tiny bits of it     i went through the little  hideous  crude factory settlement in the high  valley  where the eternal snows gleamed  past the enormous  advertisements for chocolate and hotels  up the last steep slope of the  pass to where the tunnel begins  goeschenen  the village at the mouth of  the tunnel  is all railway sidings and haphazard villas for tourists   post cards  and touts and weedy carriages  disorder and sterile chaos   high up  how should any one stay there     i went on up the pass itself  there were various parties of visitors on  the roads and tracks  people from towns incongruously walking and  driving  it was drawing on to evening  i climbed slowly  between the  great cleft in the rock where are the big iron gates  through which the  road winds  winds half way down the narrow gulley of solid  living rock   the very throat of the path  where hangs a tablet in memory of many  russians killed     emerging through the dark rocky throat of the pass i came to the upper  world  the level upper world  it was evening  livid  cold  on either  side spread the sort of moorland of the wide pass head  i drew near  along the high road  to andermatt     everywhere were soldiers moving about the livid  desolate waste of this  upper world  i passed the barracks and the first villas for visitors   darkness was coming on  the straggling  inconclusive street of andermatt  looked as if it were some accident  houses  hotels  barracks   lodging places tumbled at random as the caravan of civilization crossed  this high  cold  arid bridge of the european world     i bought two post cards and wrote them out of doors in the cold  livid  twilight  then i asked a soldier where was the post office  he directed  me  it was something like sending post cards from skegness or bognor   there in the post office     i was trying to make myself agree to stay in andermatt for the night   but i could not  the whole place was so terribly raw and flat and  accidental  as if great pieces of furniture had tumbled out of a  pantechnicon and lay discarded by the road  i hovered in the street  in  the twilight  trying to make myself stay  i looked at the announcements  of lodgings and boarding for visitors  it was no good  i could not go  into one of these houses     so i passed on  through the old  low  broad eaved houses that cringe  down to the very street  out into the open again  the air was fierce and  savage  on one side was a moorland  level  on the other a sweep of naked  hill  curved concave  and sprinkled with snow  i could see how wonderful  it would all be  under five or six feet of winter snow  skiing and  tobogganing at christmas  but it needed the snow  in the summer there is  to be seen nothing but the winter s broken detritus     the twilight deepened  though there was still the strange  glassy  translucency of the snow lit air  a fragment of moon was in the sky  a  carriage load of french tourists passed me  there was the loud noise of  water  as ever  something eternal and maddening in its sound  like the  sound of time itself  rustling and rushing and wavering  but never for a  second ceasing  the rushing of time that continues throughout eternity   this is the sound of the icy streams of switzerland  something that  mocks and destroys our warm being     so i came  in the early darkness  to the little village with the broken  castle that stands for ever frozen at the point where the track parts   one way continuing along the ridge  to the furka pass  the other  swerving over the hill to the left  over the gotthardt     in this village i must stay  i saw a woman looking hastily  furtively  from a doorway  i knew she was looking for visitors  i went on up the  hilly street  there were only a few wooden houses and a gaily lighted  wooden inn  where men were laughing  and strangers  men  standing  talking loudly in the doorway     it was very difficult to go to a house this night  i did not want to  approach any of them  i turned back to the house of the peering woman   she had looked hen like and anxious  she would be glad of a visitor to  help her pay her rent     it was a clean  pleasant wooden house  made to keep out the cold  that  seemed its one function  to defend the inmates from the cold  it was  furnished like a hut  just tables and chairs and bare wooden walls  one  felt very close and secure in the room  as in a hut  shut away from the  outer world     the hen like woman came      can i have a bed   i said   for the night        abendessen  ja    she replied   will you have soup and boiled beef and  vegetables      i said i would  so i sat down to wait  in the utter silence  i could  scarcely hear the ice stream  the silence seemed frozen  the house  empty  the woman seemed to be flitting aimlessly  scurriedly  in reflex  against the silence  one could almost touch the stillness as one could  touch the walls  or the stove  or the table with white american  oil cloth     suddenly she appeared again      what will you drink      she watched my face anxiously  and her voice was pathetic  slightly  pleading in its quickness      wine or beer   she said     i would not trust the coldness of beer      a half of red wine   i said     i knew she was going to keep me an indefinite time     she appeared with the wine and bread      would you like omelette after the beef   she asked   omelette with  cognac  i can make it  very  good      i knew i should be spending too much  but i said yes  after all  why  should i not eat  after the long walk     so she left me again  whilst i sat in the utter isolation and stillness   eating bread and drinking the wine  which was good  and i listened for  any sound  only the faint noise of the stream  and i wondered  why am i  here  on this ridge of the alps  in the lamp lit  wooden  close shut  room  alone  why am i here     yet somehow i was glad  i was happy even  such splendid silence and  coldness and clean isolation  it was something eternal  unbroachable  i  was free  in this heavy  ice cold air  this upper world  alone  london   far away below  beyond  england  germany  france  they were all so  unreal in the night  it was a sort of grief that this continent all  beneath was so unreal  false  non existent in its activity  out of the  silence one looked down on it  and it seemed to have lost all  importance  all significance  it was so big  yet it had no significance   the kingdom of the world had no significance  what could one do but  wander about     the woman came with my soup  i asked her  did not many people come in  the summer  but she was scared away  she did not answer  she went like a  leaf in the wind  however  the soup was good and plentiful     she was a long time before she came with the next course  then she put  the tray on the table  and looking at me  then looking away   shrinking  she said      you must excuse me if i don t answer you  i don t hear well  i am  rather deaf      i looked at her  and i winced also  she shrank in such simple pain from  the fact of her defect  i wondered if she were bullied because of it  or  only afraid lest visitors would dislike it     she put the dishes in order  set me my plate  quickly  nervously  and  was gone again  like a scared chicken  being tired  i wanted to weep  over her  the nervous  timid hen  so frightened by her own deafness  the  house was silent of her  empty  it was perhaps her deafness which  created this empty soundlessness     when she came with the omelette  i said to her loudly      that was very good  the soup and meat   so she quivered nervously  and  said   thank you   and i managed to talk to her  she was like most deaf  people  in that her terror of not hearing made her six times worse than  she actually was     she spoke with a soft  strange accent  so i thought she was perhaps a  foreigner  but when i asked her she misunderstood  and i had not the  heart to correct her  i can only remember she said her house was always  full in the winter  about christmas time  people came for the winter  sport  there were two young english ladies who always came to her     she spoke of them warmly  then  suddenly afraid  she drifted off again   i ate the omelette with cognac  which was very good  then i looked in  the street  it was very dark  with bright stars  and smelled of snow   two village men went by  i was tired  i did not want to go to the inn     so i went to bed  in the silent  wooden house  i had a small bedroom   clean and wooden and very cold  outside  the stream was rushing  i  covered myself with a great depth of featherbed  and looked at the  stars  and the shadowy upper world  and went to sleep     in the morning i washed in the ice cold water  and was glad to set out   an icy mist was over the noisy stream  there were a few meagre  shredded  pine trees  i had breakfast and paid my bill  it was seven francs  more  than i could afford  but that did not matter  once i was out in the air     the sky was blue and perfect  it was a ringing morning  the village was  very still  i went up the hill till i came to the signpost  i looked  down the direction of the furka  and thought of my tired englishman from  streatham  who would be on his way home  thank god i need not go home   never  perhaps  i turned up the track to the left  to the gothard     standing looking round at the mountain tops  at the village and the  broken castle below me  at the scattered debris of andermatt on the moor  in the distance  i was jumping in my soul with delight  should one ever  go down to the lower world     then i saw another figure striding along  a youth with knee breeches and  alpine hat and braces over his shirt  walking manfully  his coat slung  in his rucksack behind  i laughed  and waited  he came my way      are you going over the gothard   i said      yes   he replied   are you also       yes  i said   we will go together      so we set off  climbing a track up the heathy rocks     he was a pale  freckled town youth from basel  seventeen years old  he  was a clerk in a baggage transport firm  gondrand freres  i believe  he  had a week s holiday  in which time he was going to make a big circular  walk  something like the englishman s  but he was accustomed to this  mountain walking  he belonged to a sportverein  manfully he marched in  his thick hob nailed boots  earnestly he scrambled up the rocks     we were in the crest of the pass  broad snow patched slopes came down  from the pure sky  the defile was full of stones  all bare stones   enormous ones as big as a house  and small ones  pebbles  through these  the road wound in silence  through this upper  transcendent desolation   wherein was only the sound of the stream  sky and snow patched slopes   then the stony  rocky bed of the defile  full of morning sunshine  this  was all  we were crossing in silence from the northern world to  the southern     but he  emil  was going to take the train back  through the tunnel  in  the evening  to resume his circular walk at goeschenen     i  however  was going on  over the ridge of the world  from the north  into the south  so i was glad     we climbed up the gradual incline for a long time  the slopes above  became lower  they began to recede  the sky was very near  we were  walking under the sky     then the defile widened out  there was an open place before us  the very  top of the pass  also there were low barracks  and soldiers  we heard  firing  standing still  we saw on the slopes of snow  under the radiant  blue heaven  tiny puffs of smoke  then some small black figures crossing  the snow patch  then another rattle of rifle fire  rattling dry and  unnatural in the upper  skyey air  between the rocks       das ist schoen    said my companion  in his simple admiration       huebsch    i said      but that would be splendid  to be firing up there  manoeuvring up in  the snow      and he began to tell me how hard a soldier s life was  how hard the  soldier was drilled      you don t look forward to it   i said      oh yes  i do  i want to be a soldier  i want to serve my time       why  i said      for the exercise  the life  the drilling  one becomes strong       do all the swiss want to serve their time in the army   i asked      yes  they all want to  it is good for every man  and it keeps us all  together  besides  it is only for a year  for a year it is very good   the germans have three years  that is too long  that is bad      i told him how the soldiers in bavaria hated the military service      yes   he said   that is true of germans  the system is different  ours  is much better  in switzerland a man enjoys his time as a soldier  i  want to go      so we watched the black dots of soldiers crawling over the high snow   listened to the unnatural dry rattle of guns  up there     then we were aware of somebody whistling  of soldiers yelling down the  road  we were to come on  along the level  over the bridge  so we  marched quickly forward  away from the slopes  towards the hotel  once a  monastery  that stood in the distance  the light was blue and clear on  the reedy lakes of this upper place  it was a strange desolation of  water and bog and rocks and road  hedged by the snowy slopes round the  rim  under the very sky     the soldier was yelling again  i could not tell what he said      he says if we don t run we can t come at all   said emil      i won t run   i said     so we hurried forwards  over the bridge  where the soldier on guard was  standing      do you want to be shot   he said angrily  as we came up      no  thanks   i said     emil was very serious      how long should we have had to wait if we hadn t got through now   he  asked the soldier  when we were safely out of danger      till one o clock   was the reply      two hours   said emil  strangely elated   we should have had to wait  two hours before we could come on  he was riled that we didn t run   and  he laughed with glee     so we marched over the level to the hotel  we called in for a glass of  hot milk  i asked in german  but the maid  a pert hussy  elegant and  superior  was french  she served us with great contempt  as two  worthless creatures  poverty stricken  it abashed poor emil  but we  managed to laugh at her  this made her very angry  in the smoking room  she raised up her voice in french       du lait chaud pour les chameaux        some hot milk for the camels  she says   i translated for emil  he was  covered with confusion and youthful anger     but i called to her  tapped the table and called       mademoiselle       she appeared flouncingly in the doorway       encore du lait pour les chameaux    i said     and she whisked our glasses off the table  and flounced out without a  word     but she would not come in again with the milk  a german girl brought it   we laughed  and she smiled primly     when we set forth again  emil rolled up his sleeves and turned back his  shirt from his neck and breast  to do the thing thoroughly  besides  it  was midday  and the sun was hot  and  with his bulky pack on his back   he suggested the camel of the french maid more than ever     we were on the downward slope  only a short way from the hotel  and  there was the drop  the great cleft in the mountains running down from  this shallow pot among the peaks     the descent on the south side is much more precipitous and wonderful  than the ascent from the north  on the south  the rocks are craggy and  stupendous  the little river falls headlong down  it is not a stream  it  is one broken  panting cascade far away in the gulley below  in  the darkness     but on the slopes the sun pours in  the road winds down with its tail in  its mouth  always in endless loops returning on itself  the mules that  travel upward seem to be treading in a mill     emil took the narrow tracks  and  like the water  we cascaded down   leaping from level to level  leaping  running  leaping  descending  headlong  only resting now and again when we came down on to another  level of the high road     having begun  we could not help ourselves  we were like two stones  bouncing down  emil was highly elated  he waved his thin  bare  white  arms as he leapt  his chest grew pink with the exercise  now he felt he  was doing something that became a member of his sportverein  down we  went  jumping  running  britching     it was wonderful on this south side  so sunny  with feathery trees and  deep black shadows  it reminded me of goethe  of the romantic period          kennst du das land  wo die citronen bluehen      so we went tumbling down into the south  very swiftly  along with the  tumbling stream  but it was very tiring  we went at a great pace down  the gully  between the sheer rocks  trees grew in the ledges high over  our heads  trees grew down below  and ever we descended     till gradually the gully opened  then opened into a wide valley head   and we saw airolo away below us  the railway emerging from its hole  the  whole valley like a cornucopia full of sunshine     poor emil was tired  more tired than i was  and his big boots had hurt  his feet in the descent  so  having come to the open valley head  we  went more gently  he had become rather quiet     the head of the valley had that half tamed  ancient aspect that reminded  me of the romans  i could only expect the roman legions to be encamped  down there  and the white goats feeding on the bushes belonged to a  roman camp     but no  we saw again the barracks of the swiss soldiery  and again we  were in the midst of rifle fire and manoeuvres  but we went evenly   tired now  and hungry  we had nothing to eat     it is strange how different the sun dried  ancient  southern slopes of  the world are  from the northern slopes  it is as if the god pan really  had his home among these sun bleached stones and tough  sun dark trees   and one knows it all in one s blood  it is pure  sun dried memory  so i  was content  coming down into airolo     we found the streets were italian  the houses sunny outside and dark  within  like italy  there were laurels in the road  poor emil was a  foreigner all at once  he rolled down his shirt sleeves and fastened his  shirt neck  put on his coat and collar  and became a foreigner in his  soul  pale and strange     i saw a shop with vegetables and grapes  a real italian shop  a dark  cave       quanto costa l uva    were my first words in the south       sessanta al chilo    said the girl     and it was as pleasant as a drink of wine  the italian     so emil and i ate the sweet black grapes as we went to the station     he was very poor  we went into the third class restaurant at the  station  he ordered beer and bread and sausage  i ordered soup and  boiled beef and vegetables     they brought me a great quantity  so  whilst the girl was serving  coffee with rum to the men at the bar  i took another spoon and knife  and fork and plates for emil  and we had two dinners from my one  when  the girl  she was a woman of thirty five  came back  she looked at us  sharply  i smiled at her coaxingly  so she gave a small  kindly smile  in reply       ja  dies ist reizend    said emil   sotto voce   exulting  he was very  shy  but we were curiously happy  in that railway restaurant     then we sat very still  on the platform  and waited for the train  it  was like italy  pleasant and social to wait in the railway station  all  the world easy and warm in its activity  with the sun shining     i decided to take a franc s worth of train journey  so i chose my  station  it was one franc twenty  third class  then my train came  and  emil and i parted  he waving to me till i was out of sight  i was sorry  he had to go back  he did so want to venture forth     so i slid for a dozen miles or more  sleepily  down the ticino valley   sitting opposite two fat priests in their feminine black     when i got out at my station i felt for the first time ill at ease  why  was i getting out at this wayside place  on to the great  raw high road   i did not know  but i set off walking  it was nearly tea time     nothing in the world is more ghastly than these italian roads  new   mechanical  belonging to a machine life  the old roads are wonderful   skilfully aiming their way  but these new great roads are desolating   more desolating than all the ruins in the world     i walked on and on  down the ticino valley  towards bellinzona  the  valley was perhaps beautiful  i don t know  i can only remember the  road  it was broad and new  and it ran very often beside the railway  it  ran also by quarries and by occasional factories  also through villages   and the quality of its sordidness is something that does not bear  thinking of  a quality that has entered italian life now  if it was not  there before     here and there  where there were quarries or industries  great  lodging houses stood naked by the road  great  grey  desolate places   and squalid children were playing round the steps  and dirty men  slouched in  everything seemed under a weight     down the road of the ticino valley i felt again my terror of this new  world which is coming into being on top of us  one always feels it in a  suburb  on the edge of a town  where the land is being broken under the  advance of houses  but this is nothing  in england  to the terror one  feels on the new italian roads  where these great blind cubes of  dwellings rise stark from the destroyed earth  swarming with a sort of  verminous life  really verminous  purely destructive     it seems to happen when the peasant suddenly leaves his home and becomes  a workman  then an entire change comes over everywhere  life is now a  matter of selling oneself to slave work  building roads or labouring in  quarries or mines or on the railways  purposeless  meaningless  really  slave work  each integer doing his mere labour  and all for no purpose   except to have money  and to get away from the old system     these italian navvies work all day long  their whole life is engaged in  the mere brute labour  and they are the navvies of the world  and whilst  they are navvying  they are almost shockingly indifferent to their  circumstances  merely callous to the dirt and foulness     it is as if the whole social form were breaking down  and the human  element swarmed within the disintegration  like maggots in cheese  the  roads  the railways are built  the mines and quarries are excavated  but  the whole organism of life  the social organism  is slowly crumbling and  caving in  in a kind of process of dry rot  most terrifying to see  so  that it seems as though we should be left at last with a great system of  roads and railways and industries  and a world of utter chaos seething  upon these fabrications  as if we had created a steel framework  and the  whole body of society were crumbling and rotting in between  it is most  terrifying to realize  and i have always felt this terror upon a new  italian high road  more there than anywhere     the remembrance of the ticino valley is a sort of nightmare to me  but  it was better when at last  in the darkness of night  i got into  bellinzona  in the midst of the town one felt the old organism still  living  it is only at its extremities that it is falling to pieces  as  in dry rot     in the morning  leaving bellinzona  again i went in terror of the new   evil high road  with its skirting of huge cubical houses and its  seething navvy population  only the peasants driving in with fruit were  consoling  but i was afraid of them  the same spirit had set in in them     i was no longer happy in switzerland  not even when i was eating great  blackberries and looking down at the lago maggiore  at locarno  lying by  the lake  the terror of the callous  disintegrating process was too  strong in me     at a little inn a man was very good to me  he went into his garden and  fetched me the first grapes and apples and peaches  bringing them in  amongst leaves  and heaping them before me  he was italian swiss  he had  been in a bank in bern  now he had retired  had bought his paternal  home  and was a free man  he was about fifty years old  he spent all his  time in his garden  his daughter attended to the inn     he talked to me  as long as i stayed  about italy and switzerland and  work and life  he was retired  he was free  but he was only nominally  free  he had only achieved freedom from labour  he knew that the system  he had escaped at last  persisted  and would consume his sons and his  grandchildren  he himself had more or less escaped back to the old form   but as he came with me on to the hillside  looking down the high road at  lugano in the distance  he knew that his old order was collapsing by a  slow process of disintegration     why did he talk to me as if i had any hope  as if i represented any  positive truth as against this great negative truth that was advancing  up the hill side  again i was afraid  i hastened down the high road   past the houses  the grey  raw crystals of corruption     i saw a girl with handsome bare legs  ankles shining like brass in the  sun  she was working in a field  on the edge of a vineyard  i stopped to  look at her  suddenly fascinated by her handsome naked flesh that shone  like brass     then she called out to me  in a jargon i could not understand  something  mocking and challenging  and her voice was raucous and challenging  i  went on  afraid     in lugano i stayed at a german hotel  i remember sitting on a seat in  the darkness by the lake  watching the stream of promenaders patrolling  the edge of the water  under the trees and the lamps  i can still see  many of their faces  english  german  italian  french  and it seemed  here  here in this holiday place  was the quick of the disintegration   the dry rot  in this dry  friable flux of people backwards and forwards  on the edge of the lake  men and women from the big hotels  in evening  dress  curiously sinister  and ordinary visitors  and tourists  and  workmen  youths  men of the town  laughing  jeering  it was curiously  and painfully sinister  almost obscene     i sat a long time among them  thinking of the girl with her limbs of  glowing brass  then at last i went up to the hotel  and sat in the  lounge looking at the papers  it was the same here as down below  though  not so intense  the feeling of horror     so i went to bed  the hotel was on the edge of a steep declivity  i  wondered why the whole hills did not slide down  in some great natural  catastrophe     in the morning i walked along the side of the lake of lugano  to where i  could take a steamer to ferry me down to the end  the lake is not  beautiful  only picturesque  i liked most to think of the romans  coming to it     so i steamed down to the lower end of the water  when i landed and went  along by a sort of railway i saw a group of men  suddenly they began to  whoop and shout  they were hanging on to an immense pale bullock  which  was slung up to be shod  and it was lunging and kicking with terrible  energy  it was strange to see that mass of pale  soft looking flesh  working with such violent frenzy  convulsed with violent  active frenzy   whilst men and women hung on to it with ropes  hung on and weighed it  down  but again it scattered some of them in its terrible convulsion   human beings scattered into the road  the whole place was covered with  hot dung  and when the bullock began to lunge again  the men set up a  howl  half of triumph  half of derision     i went on  not wanting to see  i went along a very dusty road  but it  was not so terrifying  this road  perhaps it was older     in dreary little chiasso i drank coffee  and watched the come and go  through the customs  the swiss and the italian customs officials had  their offices within a few yards of each other  and everybody must stop   i went in and showed my rucksack to the italian  then i mounted a tram   and went to the lake of como     in the tram were dressed up women  fashionable  but business like  they  had come by train to chiasso  or else had been shopping in the town     when we came to the terminus a young miss  dismounting before me  left  behind her parasol  i had been conscious of my dusty  grimy appearance  as i sat in the tram  i knew they thought me a workman on the roads   however  i forgot that when it was time to dismount       pardon  mademoiselle    i said to the young miss  she turned and  withered me with a rather overdone contempt    bourgeoise    i said to  myself  as i looked at her    vous avez laisse votre parasol       she turned  and with a rapacious movement darted upon her parasol  how  her soul was in her possessions  i stood and watched her  then she went  into the road and under the trees  haughty  a demoiselle  she had on  white kid boots     i thought of the lake of como what i had thought of lugano  it must have  been wonderful when the romans came there  now it is all villas  i think  only the sunrise is still wonderful  sometimes     i took the steamer down to como  and slept in a vast old stone cavern of  an inn  a remarkable place  with rather nice people  in the morning i  went out  the peace and the bygone beauty of the cathedral created the  glow of the great past  and in the market place they were selling  chestnuts wholesale  great heaps of bright  brown chestnuts  and sacks  of chestnuts  and peasants very eager selling and buying  i thought of  como  it must have been wonderful even a hundred years ago  now it is  cosmopolitan  the cathedral is like a relic  a museum object  everywhere  stinks of mechanical money pleasure  i dared not risk walking to milan   i took a train  and there  in milan  sitting in the cathedral square  on  saturday afternoon  drinking bitter campari and watching the swarm of  italian city men drink and talk vivaciously  i saw that here the life  was still vivid  here the process of disintegration was vigorous  and  centred in a multiplicity of mechanical activities that engage the human  mind as well as the body  but always there was the same purpose stinking  in it all  the mechanizing  the perfect mechanizing of human life                       it as one clear story in your  minds  and pass it on as such to those who come after you  for now that  the house of brunswick is firmly established upon the throne and that  peace prevails in the land  it will become less easy for you every  year to understand how men felt when englishmen were in arms against  englishmen  and when he who should have been the shield and the  protector of his subjects had no thought but to force upon them what  they most abhorred and detested     my story is one which you may well treasure up in your memories  and  tell again to others  for it is not likely that in this whole county of  hampshire  or even perhaps in all england  there is another left alive  who is so well able to speak from his own knowledge of these events   or who has played a more forward part in them  all that i know i shall  endeavour soberly and in due order to put before you  i shall try to  make these dead men quicken into life for your behoof  and to call back  out of the mists of the past those scenes which were brisk enough in  the acting  though they read so dully and so heavily in the pages of the  worthy men who have set themselves to record them  perchance my words   too  might  in the ears of strangers  seem to be but an old man s  gossip  to you  however  who know that these eyes which are looking at  you looked also at the things which i describe  and that this hand has  struck in for a good cause  it will  i know  be different  bear in mind  as you listen that it was your quarrel as well as our own in which  we fought  and that if now you grow up to be free men in a free land   privileged to think or to pray as your consciences shall direct  you may  thank god that you are reaping the harvest which your fathers sowed in  blood and suffering when the stuarts were on the throne     i was born then in the year       at havant  which is a flourishing  village a few miles from portsmouth off the main london road  and there  it was that i spent the greater part of my youth  it is now as it was  then  a pleasant  healthy spot  with a hundred or more brick cottages  scattered along in a single irregular street  each with its little  garden in front  and maybe a fruit tree or two at the back  in the  middle of the village stood the old church with the square tower  and  the great sun dial like a wrinkle upon its grey weather blotched face   on the outskirts the presbyterians had their chapel  but when the act of  uniformity was passed  their good minister  master breckinridge  whose  discourses had often crowded his rude benches while the comfortable pews  of the church were empty  was cast into gaol  and his flock dispersed   as to the independents  of whom my father was one  they also were under  the ban of the law  but they attended conventicle at emsworth  whither  we would trudge  rain or shine  on every sabbath morning  these meetings  were broken up more than once  but the congregation was composed of such  harmless folk  so well beloved and respected by their neighbours  that  the peace officers came after a time to ignore them  and to let them  worship in their own fashion  there were papists  too  amongst us  who  were compelled to go as far as portsmouth for their mass  thus  you see   small as was our village  we were a fair miniature of the whole country   for we had our sects and our factions  which were all the more bitter  for being confined in so narrow a compass     my father  joseph clarke  was better known over the countryside by the  name of ironside joe  for he had served in his youth in the yaxley  troop of oliver cromwell s famous regiment of horse  and had preached  so lustily and fought so stoutly that old noll himself called him out  of the ranks after the fight at dunbar  and raised him to a cornetcy   it chanced  however  that having some little time later fallen into an  argument with one of his troopers concerning the mystery of the trinity   the man  who was a half crazy zealot  smote my father across the face  a  favour which he returned by a thrust from his broadsword  which sent his  adversary to test in person the truth of his beliefs  in most armies  it would have been conceded that my father was within his rights  in punishing promptly so rank an act of mutiny  but the soldiers of  cromwell had so high a notion of their own importance and privileges   that they resented this summary justice upon their companion  a  court martial sat upon my father  and it is likely that he would have  been offered up as a sacrifice to appease the angry soldiery  had not  the lord protector interfered  and limited the punishment to dismissal  from the army  cornet clarke was accordingly stripped of his buff  coat and steel cap  and wandered down to havant  where he settled into  business as a leather merchant and tanner  thereby depriving parliament  of as trusty a soldier as ever drew blade in its service  finding  that he prospered in trade  he took as wife mary shepstone  a young  churchwoman  and i  micah clarke  was the first pledge of their union     my father  as i remember him first  was tall and straight  with a great  spread of shoulder and a mighty chest  his face was craggy and stern   with large harsh features  shaggy over hanging brows  high bridged  fleshy nose  and a full lipped mouth which tightened and set when he  was angry  his grey eyes were piercing and soldier like  yet i have seen  them lighten up into a kindly and merry twinkle  his voice was the most  tremendous and awe inspiring that i have ever listened to  i can well  believe what i have heard  that when he chanted the hundredth psalm as  he rode down among the blue bonnets at dunbar  the sound of him rose  above the blare of trumpets and the crash of guns  like the deep roll of  a breaking wave  yet though he possessed every quality which was  needed to raise him to distinction as an officer  he had thrown off his  military habits when he returned to civil life  as he prospered and grew  rich he might well have worn a sword  but instead he would ever bear a  small copy of the scriptures bound to his girdle  where other men hung  their weapons  he was sober and measured in his speech  and it was  seldom  even in the bosom of his own family  that he would speak of the  scenes which he had taken part in  or of the great men  fleetwood and  harrison  blake and ireton  desborough and lambert  some of whom had  been simple troopers like himself when the troubles broke out  he was  frugal in his eating  backward in drinking  and allowed himself no  pleasures save three pipes a day of oronooko tobacco  which he kept ever  in a brown jar by the great wooden chair on the left hand side of the  mantelshelf     yet for all his self restraint the old leaven would at times begin to  work in him  and bring on fits of what his enemies would call fanaticism  and his friends piety  though it must be confessed that this piety  was prone to take a fierce and fiery shape  as i look back  one or two  instances of that stand out so hard and clear in my recollection that  they might be scenes which i had seen of late in the playhouse  instead  of memories of my childhood more than threescore years ago  when the  second charles was on the throne     the first of these occurred when i was so young that i can remember  neither what went before nor what immediately after it  it stuck in my  infant mind when other things slipped through it  we were all in the  house one sultry summer evening  when there came a rattle of kettledrums  and a clatter of hoofs  which brought my mother and my father to the  door  she with me in her arms that i might have the better view  it was  a regiment of horse on their way from chichester to portsmouth  with  colours flying and band playing  making the bravest show that ever my  youthful eyes had rested upon  with what wonder and admiration did i  gaze at the sleek prancing steeds  the steel morions  the plumed hats  of the officers  the scarfs and bandoliers  never  i thought  had such  a gallant company assembled  and i clapped my hands and cried out in my  delight  my father smiled gravely  and took me from my mother s arms    nay  lad   he said   thou art a soldier s son  and should have more  judgment than to commend such a rabble as this  canst thou not  child as  thou art  see that their arms are ill found  their stirrup irons rusted   and their ranks without order or cohesion  neither have they thrown out  a troop in advance  as should even in times of peace be done  and their  rear is straggling from here to bedhampton  yea   he continued  suddenly  shaking his long arm at the troopers  and calling out to them   ye are  corn ripe for the sickle and waiting only for the reapers   several of  them reined up at this sudden out flame   hit the crop eared rascal over  the pate  jack   cried one to another  wheeling his horse round  but  there was that in my father s face which caused him to fall back into  the ranks again with his purpose unfulfilled  the regiment jingled on  down the road  and my mother laid her thin hands upon my father s arm   and lulled with her pretty coaxing ways the sleeping devil which had  stirred within him     on another occasion which i can remember  about my seventh or eighth  year  his wrath burst out with more dangerous effect  i was playing  about him as he worked in the tanning yard one spring afternoon  when  in through the open doorway strutted two stately gentlemen  with  gold facings to their coats and smart cockades at the side of their  three cornered hats  they were  as i afterwards understood  officers of  the fleet who were passing through havant  and seeing us at work in the  yard  designed to ask us some question as to their route  the younger of  the pair accosted my father and began his speech by a great clatter of  words which were all high dutch to me  though i now see that they were a  string of such oaths as are common in the mouth of a sailor  though why  the very men who are in most danger of appearing before the almighty  should go out of their way to insult him  hath ever been a mystery to  me  my father in a rough stern voice bade him speak with more reverence  of sacred things  on which the pair of them gave tongue together   swearing tenfold worse than before  and calling my father a canting  rogue and a smug faced presbytery jack  what more they might have said i  know not  for my father picked up the great roller wherewith he smoothed  the leather  and dashing at them he brought it down on the side of one  of their heads with such a swashing blow  that had it not been for his  stiff hat the man would never have uttered oath again  as it was  he  dropped like a log upon the stones of the yard  while his companion  whipped out his rapier and made a vicious thrust  but my father  who was  as active as he was strong  sprung aside  and bringing his cudgel down  upon the outstretched arm of the officer  cracked it like the stem of  a tobacco pipe  this affair made no little stir  for it occurred at  the time when those arch liars  oates  bedloe  and carstairs  were  disturbing the public mind by their rumours of plots  and a rising of  some sort was expected throughout the country  within a few days all  hampshire was ringing with an account of the malcontent tanner of  havant  who had broken the head and the arm of two of his majesty s  servants  an inquiry showed  however  that there was no treasonable  meaning in the matter  and the officers having confessed that the first  words came from them  the justices contented themselves with imposing a  fine upon my father  and binding him over to keep the peace for a period  of six months     i tell you these incidents that you may have an idea of the fierce and  earnest religion which filled not only your own ancestor  but most of  those men who were trained in the parliamentary armies  in many ways  they were more like those fanatic saracens  who believe in conversion by  the sword  than the followers of a christian creed  yet they have this  great merit  that their own lives were for the most part clean and  commendable  for they rigidly adhered themselves to those laws which  they would gladly have forced at the sword s point upon others  it is  true that among so many there were some whose piety was a shell for  their ambition  and others who practised in secret what they denounced  in public  but no cause however good is free from such hypocritical  parasites  that the greater part of the saints  as they termed  themselves  were men of sober and god fearing lives  may be shown by the  fact that  after the disbanding of the army of the commonwealth  the old  soldiers flocked into trade throughout the country  and made their mark  wherever they went by their industry and worth  there is many a wealthy  business house now in england which can trace its rise to the thrift and  honesty of some simple pikeman of ireton or cromwell     but that i may help you to understand the character of your  great grandfather  i shall give an incident which shows how fervent and  real were the emotions which prompted the violent moods which i have  described  i was about twelve at the time  my brothers hosea and ephraim  were respectively nine and seven  while little ruth could scarce have  been more than four  it chanced that a few days before a wandering  preacher of the independents had put up at our house  and his religious  ministrations had left my father moody and excitable  one night i had  gone to bed as usual  and was sound asleep with my two brothers beside  me  when we were roused and ordered to come downstairs  huddling on our  clothes we followed him into the kitchen  where my mother was sitting  pale and scared with ruth upon her knee      gather round me  my children   he said  in a deep reverent voice   that  we may all appear before the throne together  the kingdom of the lord is  at hand oh  be ye ready to receive him  this very night  my loved ones   ye shall see him in his splendour  with the angels and the archangels in  their might and their glory  at the third hour shall he come that very  third hour which is now drawing upon us       dear joe   said my mother  in soothing tones   thou art scaring thyself  and the children to no avail  if the son of man be indeed coming  what  matters it whether we be abed or afoot       peace  woman   he answered sternly   has he not said that he will come  like a thief in the night  and that it is for us to await him  join  with me  then  in prayerful outpourings that we may be found as those in  bridal array  let us offer up thanks that he has graciously vouchsafed  to warn us through the words of his servant  oh  great lord  look down  upon this small flock and lead it to the sheep fold  mix not the  little wheat with the great world of chaff  oh  merciful father  look  graciously upon my wife  and forgive her the sin of erastianism  she  being but a woman and little fitted to cast off the bonds of antichrist  wherein she was born  and these too  my little ones  micah and hosea   ephraim and ruth  all named after thy faithful servants of old  oh let  them stand upon thy right hand this night   thus he prayed on in a wild  rush of burning  pleading words  writhing prostrate upon the floor  in the vehemence of his supplication  while we  poor trembling mites   huddled round our mother s skirts and gazed with terror at the contorted  figure seen by the dim light of the simple oil lamp  on a sudden the  clang of the new church clock told that the hour had come  my father  sprang from the floor  and rushing to the casement  stared up with wild  expectant eyes at the starry heavens  whether he conjured up some vision  in his excited brain  or whether the rush of feeling on finding that his  expectations were in vain  was too much for him  it is certain that  he threw his long arms upwards  uttered a hoarse scream  and tumbled  backwards with foaming lips and twitching limbs upon the ground  for an  hour or more my poor mother and i did what we could to soothe him  while  the children whimpered in a corner  until at last he staggered slowly to  his feet  and in brief broken words ordered us to our rooms  from that  time i have never heard him allude to the matter  nor did he ever give  us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second  coming upon that particular night  i have learned since  however   that the preacher who visited us was what was called in those days a  fifth monarchy man  and that this particular sect was very liable to  these premonitions  i have no doubt that something which he had said had  put the thought into my father s head  and that the fiery nature of the  man had done the rest     so much for your great grandfather  ironside joe  i have preferred to  put these passages before you  for on the principle that actions speak  louder than words  i find that in describing a man s character it is  better to give examples of his ways than to speak in broad and general  terms  had i said that he was fierce in ins religion and subject to  strange fits of piety  the words might have made little impression  upon you  but when i tell you of his attack upon the officers in the  tanning yard  and his summoning us down in the dead of the night to  await the second coming  you can judge for yourselves the lengths to  which his belief would carry him  for the rest  he was an excellent man  of business  fair and even generous in his dealings  respected by all  and loved by few  for his nature was too self contained to admit of much  affection  to us he was a stern and rigid father  punishing us heavily  for whatever he regarded as amiss in our conduct  he bad a store of such  proverbs as  give a child its will and a whelp its fill  and neither  will strive   or  children are certain cares and uncertain comforts    wherewith he would temper my mother s more kindly impulses  he could not  bear that we should play trick track upon the green  or dance with the  other children upon the saturday night     as to my mother  dear soul  it was her calm  peaceful influence which  kept my father within bounds  and softened his austere rule  seldom  indeed  even in his darkest moods  did the touch of her gentle hand and  the sound of her voice fail to soothe his fiery spirit  she came of a  church stock  and held to her religion with a quiet grip which was proof  against every attempt to turn her from it  i imagine that at one time  her husband had argued much with her upon arminianism and the sin of  simony  but finding his exhortations useless  he had abandoned the  subject save on very rare occasions  in spite of her episcopacy   however  she remained a staunch whig  and never allowed her loyalty to  the throne to cloud her judgment as to the doings of the monarch who sat  upon it     women were good housekeepers fitly years ago  but she was conspicuous  among the best  to see her spotless cuffs and snowy kirtle one would  scarce credit how hard she laboured  it was only the well ordered house  and the dustless rooms which proclaimed her constant industry  she  made salves and eyewaters  powders and confects  cordials and persico   orangeflower water and cherry brandy  each in its due season  and all of  the best  she was wise  too  in herbs and simples  the villagers and the  farm labourers would rather any day have her advice upon their ailments  than that of dr  jackson of purbrook  who never mixed a draught under  a silver crown  over the whole countryside there was no woman more  deservedly respected and more esteemed both by those above her and by  those beneath     such were my parents as i remember them in my childhood  as to myself  i  shall let my story explain the growth of my own nature  my brothers and  my sister were all brownfaced  sturdy little country children  with no  very marked traits save a love of mischief controlled by the fear of  their father  these  with martha the serving maid  formed our whole  household during those boyish years when the pliant soul of the child  is hardening into the settled character of the man  how these influences  affected me i shall leave for a future sitting  and if i weary you by  recording them  you must remember that i am telling these things rather  for your profit than for your amusement  that it may assist you in your  journey through life to know how another has picked out the path before  you         chapter ii  of my going to school and of my coming thence       with the home influences which i have described  it may be readily  imagined that my young mind turned very much upon the subject of  religion  the more so as my father and mother took different views upon  it  the old puritan soldier held that the bible alone contained all  things essential to salvation  and that though it might be advisable  that those who were gifted with wisdom or eloquence should expound the  scriptures to their brethren  it was by no means necessary  but rather  hurtful and degrading  that any organised body of ministers or of  bishops should claim special prerogatives  or take the place of  mediators between the creature and the creator  for the wealthy  dignitaries of the church  rolling in their carriages to their  cathedrals  in order to preach the doctrines of their master  who wore  his sandals out in tramping over the countryside  he professed the most  bitter contempt  nor was he more lenient to those poorer members of the  clergy who winked at the vices of their patrons that they might secure  a seat at their table  and who would sit through a long evening of  profanity rather than bid good bye to the cheesecakes and the wine  flask  that such men represented religious truth was abhorrent to  his mind  nor would he even give his adhesion to that form of church  government dear to the presbyterians  where a general council of the  ministers directed the affairs of their church  every man was  in his  opinion  equal in the eyes of the almighty  and none had a right to  claim any precedence over his neighbour in matters of religion  the book  was written for all  and all were equally able to read it  provided that  their minds were enlightened by the holy spirit     my mother  on the other hand  held that the very essence of a church  was that it should have a hierarchy and a graduated government within  itself  with the king at the apex  the archbishops beneath him  the  bishops under their control  and so down through the ministry to the  common folk  such was  in her opinion  the church as established in the  beginning  and no religion without these characteristics could lay any  claim to being the true one  ritual was to her of as great importance  as morality  and if every tradesman and farmer were allowed to invent  prayers  and change the service as the fancy seized him  it would be  impossible to preserve the purity of the christian creed  she agreed  that religion was based upon the bible  but the bible was a book which  contained much that was obscure  and unless that obscurity were  cleared away by a duly elected and consecrated servant of god  a  lineal descendant of the disciples  all human wisdom might not serve to  interpret it aright  that was my mother s position  and neither argument  nor entreaty could move her from it  the only question of belief on  which my two parents were equally ardent was their mutual dislike  and distrust of the roman catholic forms of worship  and in this the  churchwoman was every whit as decided as the fanatical independent     it may seem strange to you in these days of tolerance  that the  adherents of this venerable creed should have met with such universal  ill will from successive generations of englishmen  we recognise now  that there are no more useful or loyal citizens in the state than our  catholic brethren  and mr  alexander pope or any other leading papist is  no more looked down upon for his religion than was mr  william penn  for his quakerism in the reign of king james  we can scarce credit how  noblemen like lord stafford  ecclesiastics like archbishop plunkett   and commoners like langhorne and pickering  were dragged to death on  the testimony of the vilest of the vile  without a voice being raised in  their behalf  or how it could be considered a patriotic act on the part  of an english protestant to carry a flail loaded with lead beneath his  cloak as a menace against his harmless neighbours who differed from  him on points of doctrine  it was a long madness which has now happily  passed off  or at least shows itself in a milder and rarer form     foolish as it appears to us  there were some solid reasons to account  for it  you have read doubtless how  a century before i was born  the  great kingdom of spain waxed and prospered  her ships covered every  sea  her troops were victorious wherever they appeared  in letters  in  learning  in all the arts of war and peace they were the foremost nation  in europe  you have heard also of the ill blood which existed between  this great nation and ourselves  how our adventurers harried their  possessions across the atlantic  while they retorted by burning such  of our seamen as they could catch by their devilish inquisition  and by  threatening our coasts both from cadiz and from their provinces in the  netherlands  at last so hot became the quarrel that the other nations  stood off  as i have seen the folk clear a space for the sword players  at hockley in the hole  so that the spanish giant and tough little  england were left face to face to fight the matter out  throughout all  that business it was as the emissary of the pope  and as the avenger of  the dishonoured roman church  that king philip professed to come  it  is true that lord howard and many another gentleman of the old religion  fought stoutly against the dons  but the people could never forget that  the reformed faith had been the flag under which they had conquered  and  that the blessing of the pontiff had rested with their opponents  then  came the cruel and foolish attempt of mary to force upon them a creed  for which they had no sympathy  and at the heels of it another great  roman catholic power menaced our liberty from the continent  the growing  strength of france promoted a corresponding distrust of papistry in  england  which reached a head when  at about the time of which i write   louis xiv  threatened us with invasion at the very moment when  by  the revocation of the edict of nantes  he showed his intolerant spirit  towards the faith which we held dear  the narrow protestantism of  england was less a religious sentiment than a patriotic reply to  the aggressive bigotry of her enemies  our catholic countrymen were  unpopular  not so much because they believed in transubstantiation  as  because they were unjustly suspected of sympathising with the emperor or  with the king of france  now that our military successes have secured us  against all fear of attack  we have happily lost that bitter religious  hatred but for which oates and dangerfield would have lied in vain     in the days when i was young  special causes had inflamed this dislike  and made it all the more bitter because there was a spice of fear  mingled with it  as long as the catholics were only an obscure faction  they might be ignored  but when  towards the close of the reign of the  second charles  it appeared to be absolutely certain that a catholic  dynasty was about to fill the throne  and that catholicism was to be the  court religion and the stepping stone to preferment  it was felt that  a day of vengeance might be at hand for those who had trampled upon  it when it was defenceless  there was alarm and uneasiness amongst all  classes  the church of england  which depends upon the monarch as an  arch depends upon the keystone  the nobility  whose estates and coffers  had been enriched by the plunder of the abbeys  the mob  whose ideas of  papistry were mixed up with thumbscrews and fox s martyrology  were all  equally disturbed  nor was the prospect a hopeful one for their cause   charles was a very lukewarm protestant  and indeed showed upon his  deathbed that he was no protestant at all  there was no longer any  chance of his having legitimate offspring  the duke of york  his younger  brother  was therefore heir to the throne  and he was known to be an  austere and narrow papist  while his spouse  mary of modena  was  as bigoted as himself  should they have children  there could be  no question but that they would be brought up in the faith of their  parents  and that a line of catholic monarchs would occupy the throne  of england  to the church  as represented by my mother  and to  nonconformity  in the person of my father  this was an equally  intolerable prospect     i have been telling you all this old history because you will find  as  i go on  that this state of things caused in the end such a seething and  fermenting throughout the nation that even i  a simple village lad  was  dragged into the whirl and had my whole life influenced by it  if i did  not make the course of events clear to you  you would hardly understand  the influences which had such an effect upon my whole history  in the  meantime  i wish you to remember that when king james ii  ascended the  throne he did so amid a sullen silence on the part of a large class of  his subjects  and that both my father and my mother were among those who  were zealous for a protestant succession     my childhood was  as i have already said  a gloomy one  now and again  when there chanced to be a fair at portsdown hill  or when a passing  raree showman set up his booth in the village  my dear mother would  slip a penny or two from her housekeeping money into my hand  and with  a warning finger upon her lip would send me off to see the sights  these  treats were  however  rare events  and made such a mark upon my mind   that when i was sixteen years of age i could have checked off upon my  fingers all that i had ever seen  there was william harker the strong  man  who lifted farmer alcott s roan mare  and there was tubby lawson  the dwarf  who could fit himself into a pickle jar  these two i well  remember from the wonder wherewith they struck my youthful soul  then  there was the show of the playing dolls  and that of the enchanted  island and mynheer munster from the lowlands  who could turn himself  round upon a tight rope while playing most sweetly upon a virginal   last  but far the best in my estimation  was the grand play at the  portsdown fair  entitled  the true and ancient story of maudlin  the  merchant s daughter of bristol  and of her lover antonio  how they were  cast away on the shores of barbary  where the mermaids are seen floating  upon the sea and singing in the rocks  foretelling their danger   this  little piece gave me keener pleasure than ever in after years i received  from the grandest comedies of mr  congreve and of mr  dryden  though  acted by kynaston  betterton  and the whole strength of the king s own  company  at chichester once i remember that i paid a penny to see the  left shoe of the youngest sister of potiphar s wife  but as it looked  much like any other old shoe  and was just about the size to have fitted  the show woman  i have often feared that my penny fell into the hands of  rogues     there were other shows  however  which i might see for nothing  and yet  were more real and every whit as interesting as any for which i  paid  now and again upon a holiday i was permitted to walk down to  portsmouth  once i was even taken in front of my father upon his pad  nag  and there i wandered with him through the streets with wondering  eyes  marvelling over the strange sights around me  the walls and the  moats  the gates and the sentinels  the long high street with the great  government buildings  and the constant rattle of drums and blare of  trumpets  they made my little heart beat quicker beneath my sagathy  stuff jacket  here was the house in which some thirty years before the  proud duke of buckingham had been struck down by the assassin s dagger   there  too  was the governor s dwelling  and i remember that even as i  looked he came riding up to it  red faced and choleric  with a nose such  as a governor should have  and his breast all slashed with gold   is he  not a fine man   i said  looking up at my father  he laughed and drew  his hat down over his brows   it is the first time that i have seen sir  ralph lingard s face   said he   but i saw his back at preston fight   ah  lad  proud as he looks  if he did but see old noll coming in through  the door he would not think it beneath him to climb out through the  window   the clank of steel or the sight of a buff coat would always  serve to stir up the old roundhead bitterness in my father s breast     but there were other sights in portsmouth besides the red coats and  their governor  the yard was the second in the kingdom  after chatham   and there was ever some new war ship ready upon the slips  then there  was a squadron of king s ships  and sometimes the whole fleet at  spithead  when the streets would be full of sailors  with their faces as  brown as mahogany and pigtails as stiff and hard as their cutlasses  to  watch their rolling gait  and to hear their strange  quaint talk   and their tales of the dutch wars  was a rare treat to me  and i have  sometimes when i was alone fastened myself on to a group of them  and  passed the day in wandering from tavern to tavern  it chanced one day   however  that one of them insisted upon my sharing his glass of canary  wine  and afterwards out of roguishness persuaded me to take a second   with the result that i was sent home speechless in the carrier s cart   and was never again allowed to go into portsmouth alone  my father was  less shocked at the incident than i should have expected  and reminded  my mother that noah had been overtaken in a similar manner  he also  narrated how a certain field chaplain grant  of desborough s regiment   having after a hot and dusty day drunk sundry flagons of mum  had  thereafter sung certain ungodly songs  and danced in a manner unbecoming  to his sacred profession  also  how he had afterwards explained that  such backslidings were not to be regarded us faults of the individual   but rather as actual obsessions of the evil one  who contrived in this  manner to give scandal to the faithful  and selected the most godly for  his evil purpose  this ingenious defence of the field chaplain was the  saving of my back  for my father  who was a believer in solomon s axiom   had a stout ash stick and a strong arm for whatever seemed to him to be  a falling away from the true path     from the day that i first learned my letters from the horn book at my  mother s knee i was always hungry to increase my knowledge  and never a  piece of print came in my way that i did not eagerly master  my father  pushed the sectarian hatred of learning to such a length that he was  averse to having any worldly books within his doors   note a  appendix   i was dependent therefore for my supply upon one or two of my friends in  the village  who lent me a volume at a time from their small libraries   these i would carry inside my shirt  and would only dare to produce when  i could slip away into the fields  and lie hid among the long grass  or  at night when the rushlight was still burning  and my father s snoring  assured me that there was no danger of his detecting me  in this way  i worked up from don bellianis of greece and the  seven champions    through tarleton s  jests  and other such books  until i could take  pleasure in the poetry of waller and of herrick  or in the plays of  massinger and shakespeare  how sweet were the hours when i could lay  aside all thought of freewill and of predestination  to lie with my  heels in the air among the scented clover  and listen to old chaucer  telling the sweet story of grisel the patient  or to weep for the chaste  desdemona  and mourn over the untimely end of her gallant spouse  there  were times as i rose up with my mind full of the noble poetry  and  glanced over the fair slope of the countryside  with the gleaming sea  beyond it  and the purple outline of the isle of wight upon the horizon   when it would be borne in upon me that the being who created all this   and who gave man the power of pouring out these beautiful thoughts  was  not the possession of one sect or another  or of this nation or that   but was the kindly father of every one of the little children whom  he had let loose on this fair playground  it grieved me then  and it  grieves me now  that a man of such sincerity and lofty purpose as your  great grandfather should have been so tied down by iron doctrines  and  should imagine his creator to be so niggard of his mercy as to withhold  it from nine and ninety in the hundred  well  a man is as he is trained   and if my father bore a narrow mind upon his broad shoulders  he has at  least the credit that he was ready to do and to suffer all things  for what he conceived to be the truth  if you  my dears  have more  enlightened views  take heed that they bring you to lead a more  enlightened life     when i was fourteen years of age  a yellow haired  brown faced lad  i  was packed off to a small private school at petersfield  and there i  remained for a year  returning home for the last saturday in each month   i took with me only a scanty outfit of schoolbooks  with lilly s  latin  grammar   and rosse s  view of all the religions in the world from the  creation down to our own times   which was shoved into my hands by my  good mother as a parting present  with this small stock of letters i  might have fared badly  had it not happened that my master  mr  thomas  chillingfoot  had himself a good library  and took a pleasure in  lending his books to any of his scholars who showed a desire to improve  themselves  under this good old man s care i not only picked up some  smattering of latin and greek  but i found means to read good english  translations of many of the classics  and to acquire a knowledge of the  history of my own and other countries  i was rapidly growing in mind as  well as in body  when my school career was cut short by no less an event  than my summary and ignominious expulsion  how this unlooked for ending  to my studies came about i must now set before you     petersfield had always been a great stronghold of the church  having  hardly a nonconformist within its bounds  the reason of this was that  most of the house property was owned by zealous churchmen  who refused  to allow any one who differed from the established church to settle  there  the vicar  whose name was pinfold  possessed in this manner great  power in the town  and as he was a man with a high inflamed countenance  and a pompous manner  he inspired no little awe among the quiet  inhabitants  i can see him now with his beaked nose  his rounded  waistcoat  and his bandy legs  which looked as if they had given way  beneath the load of learning which they were compelled to carry  walking  slowly with right hand stiffly extended  tapping the pavement at every  step with his metal headed stick  he would pause as each person passed  him  and wait to see that he was given the salute which he thought due  to his dignity  this courtesy he never dreamed of returning  save in  the case of some of his richer parishioners  but if by chance it were  omitted  he would hurry after the culprit  and  shaking his stick in his  face  insist upon his doffing his cap to him  we youngsters  if we met  him on our walks  would scuttle by him like a brood of chickens passing  an old turkey cock  and even our worthy master showed a disposition to  turn down a side street when the portly figure of the vicar was seen  rolling in our direction  this proud priest made a point of knowing the  history of every one within his parish  and having learnt that i was the  son of an independent  he spoke severely to mr  chillingfoot upon the  indiscretion which he had shown in admitting me to his school  indeed   nothing but my mother s good name for orthodoxy prevented him from  insisting upon my dismissal     at the other end of the village there was a large day school  a constant  feud prevailed between the scholars who attended it and the lads who  studied under our master  no one could tell how the war broke out  but  for many years there had been a standing quarrel between the two  which  resulted in skirmishes  sallies  and ambuscades  with now and then a  pitched battle  no great harm was done in these encounters  for the  weapons were usually snowballs in winter and pine cones or clods of  earth in the summer  even when the contest got closer and we came to  fisticuffs  a few bruises and a little blood was the worst that could  come of it  our opponents were more numerous than we  but we had the  advantage of being always together and of having a secure asylum upon  which to retreat  while they  living in scattered houses all over the  parish  had no common rallying point  a stream  crossed by two bridges   ran through the centre of the town  and this was the boundary which  separated our territories from those of our enemies  the boy who crossed  the bridge found himself in hostile country     it chanced that in the first conflict which occurred after my arrival at  the school i distinguished myself by singling out the most redoubtable  of our foemen  and smiting him such a blow that he was knocked helpless  and was carried off by our party as a prisoner  this feat of arms  established my good name as a warrior  so i came at last to be regarded  as the leader of our forces  and to be looked up to by bigger boys than  myself  this promotion tickled my fancy so much  that i set to work to  prove that i deserved it by devising fresh and ingenious schemes for the  defeat of our enemies     one winter s evening news reached us that our rivals were about to make  a raid upon us under cover of night  and that they proposed coming by  the little used plank bridge  so as to escape our notice  this bridge  lay almost out of the town  and consisted of a single broad piece of  wood without a rail  erected for the good of the town clerk  who lived   just opposite to it  we proposed to hide ourselves amongst the bushes on  our side of the stream  and make an unexpected attack upon the invaders  as they crossed  as we started  however  i bethought me of an ingenious  stratagem which i had read of as being practised in the german wars  and  having expounded it to the great delight of my companions  we took mr   chillingfoot s saw  and set off for the seat of action     on reaching the bridge all was quiet and still  it was quite dark and  very cold  for christmas was approaching  there were no signs of our  opponents  we exchanged a few whispers as to who should do the daring  deed  but as the others shrank from it  and as i was too proud to  propose what i dare not execute  i gripped the saw  and sitting  astraddle upon the plank set to work upon the very centre of it     my purpose was to weaken it in such a way that  though it would bear the  weight of one  it would collapse when the main body of our foemen were  upon it  and so precipitate them into the ice cold stream  the water was  but a couple of feet deep at the place  so that there was nothing for  them but a fright and a ducking  so cool a reception ought to deter  them from ever invading us again  and confirm my reputation as a daring  leader  reuben lockarby  my lieutenant  son of old john lockarby of the  wheatsheaf  marshalled our forces behind the hedgerow  whilst i sawed  vigorously at the plank until i had nearly severed it across  i had no  compunction about the destruction of the bridge  for i knew enough of  carpentry to see that a skilful joiner could in an hour s work make  it stronger than ever by putting a prop beneath the point where i had  divided it  when at last i felt by the yielding of the plank that i had  done enough  and that the least strain would snap it  i crawled quietly  off  and taking up my position with my schoolfellows  awaited the coming  of the enemy     i had scarce concealed myself when we heard the steps of some one  approaching down the footpath which led to the bridge  we crouched  behind the cover  convinced that the sound must come from some scout  whom our foemen had sent on in front  a big boy evidently  for his step  was heavy and slow  with a clinking noise mingling with it  of which we  could make nothing  nearer came the sound and nearer  until a shadowy  figure loomed out of the darkness upon the other side  and after pausing  and peering for a moment  came straight for the bridge  it was only as  he was setting foot upon the plank and beginning gingerly to pick his  way across it  that we discerned the outlines of the familiar form  and  realised the dreadful truth that the stranger whom we had taken for the  advance guard of our enemy was in truth none other than vicar pinfold   and that it was the rhythmic pat of his stick which we heard mingling  with his footfalls  fascinated by the sight  we lay bereft of all power  to warn him  a line of staring eyeballs  one step  two steps  three  steps did the haughty churchman take  when there was a rending crack   and he vanished with a mighty splash into the swift flowing stream  he  must have fallen upon his back  for we could see the curved outline  of his portly figure standing out above the surface as he struggled  desperately to regain his feet  at last he managed to get erect  and  came spluttering for the bank with such a mixture of godly ejaculations  and of profane oaths that  even in our terror  we could not keep from  laughter  rising from under his feet like a covey of wild fowl  we  scurried off across the fields and so back to the school  where  as you  may imagine  we said nothing to our good master of what had occurred     the matter was too serious  however  to be hushed up  the sudden chill  set up some manner of disturbance in the bottle of sack which the vicar  had just been drinking with the town clerk  and an attack of gout set in  which laid him on his back for a fortnight  meanwhile an examination of  the bridge had shown that it had been sawn across  and an inquiry traced  the matter to mr  chillingfoot s boarders  to save a wholesale expulsion  of the school from the town  i was forced to acknowledge myself as both  the inventor and perpetrator of the deed  chillingfoot was entirely in  the power of the vicar  so he was forced to read me a long homily  in public  which he balanced by an affectionate leave taking in  private  and to expel me solemnly from the school  i never saw my old  master again  for he died not many years afterwards  but i hear that his  second son william is still carrying on the business  which is larger  and more prosperous than of old  his eldest son turned quaker and went  out to penn s settlement  where he is reported to have been slain by the  savages     this adventure shocked my dear mother  but it found great favour in the  eyes of my father  who laughed until the whole village resounded  with his stentorian merriment  it reminded him  he said  of a similar  stratagem executed at market drayton by that god fearing soldier colonel  pride  whereby a captain and three troopers of lunsford s own regiment  of horse had been drowned  and many others precipitated into a river  to  the great glory of the true church and to the satisfaction of the  chosen people  even of the church folk many were secretly glad at the  misfortune which had overtaken the vicar  for his pretensions and his  pride had made him hated throughout the district     by this time i had grown into a sturdy  broad shouldered lad  and every  month added to my strength and my stature  when i was sixteen i could  carry a bag of wheat or a cask of beer against any man in the village   and i could throw the fifteen pound putting stone to a distance of  thirty six feet  which was four feet further than could ted dawson  the  blacksmith  once when my father was unable to carry a bale of skins out  of the yard  i whipped it up and bare it away upon my shoulders  the  old man would often look gravely at me from under his heavy thatched  eyebrows  and shake his grizzled head as he sat in his arm chair puffing  his pipe   you grow too big for the nest  lad   he would say   i doubt  some of these days you ll find your wings and away   in my heart i  longed that the time would come  for i was weary of the quiet life of  the village  and was anxious to see the great world of which i had heard  and read so much  i could not look southward without my spirit stirring  within me as my eyes fell upon those dark waves  the white crests of  which are like a fluttering signal ever waving to an english youth and  beckoning him to some unknown but glorious goal         chapter iii  of two friends of my youth      i fear  my children  that you will think that the prologue is over long  for the play  but the foundations must be laid before the building is  erected  and a statement of this sort is a sorry and a barren thing  unless you have a knowledge of the folk concerned  be patient  then   while i speak to you of the old friends of my youth  some of whom you  may hear more of hereafter  while others remained behind in the country  hamlet  and yet left traces of our early intercourse upon my character  which might still be discerned there     foremost for good amongst all whom i knew was zachary palmer  the  village carpenter  a man whose aged and labour warped body contained the  simplest and purest of spirits  yet his simplicity was by no means the  result of ignorance  for from the teachings of plato to those of hobbes  there were few systems ever thought out by man which he had not studied  and weighed  books were far dearer in my boyhood than they are now   and carpenters were less well paid  but old palmer had neither wife nor  child  and spent little on food or raiment  thus it came about that on  the shelf over his bed he had a more choice collection of books  few as  they were in number  than the squire or the parson  and these books he  had read until he not only understood them himself  but could impart  them to others     this white bearded and venerable village philosopher would sit by his  cabin door upon a summer evening  and was never so pleased as when  some of the young fellows would slip away from their bowls and their  quoit playing in order to lie in the grass at his feet  and ask him  questions about the great men of old  their words and their deeds  but  of all the youths i and reuben lockarby  the innkeeper s son  were his  two favourites  for we would come the earliest and stop the latest to  hear the old man talk  no father could have loved his children better  than he did us  and he would spare no pains to get at our callow  thoughts  and to throw light upon whatever perplexed or troubled us   like all growing things  we had run our heads against the problem of  the universe  we had peeped and pryed with our boyish eyes into those  profound depths in which the keenest sighted of the human race had seen  no bottom  yet when we looked around us in our own village world  and  saw the bitterness and rancour which pervaded every sect  we could not  but think that a tree which bore such fruit must have something amiss  with it  this was one of the thoughts unspoken to our parents which  we carried to good old zachary  and on which he had much to say which  cheered and comforted us      these janglings and wranglings   said he   are but on the surface   and spring from the infinite variety of the human mind  which will ever  adapt a creed to suit its own turn of thought  it is the solid core that  underlies every christian creed which is of importance  could you  but live among the romans or the greeks  in the days before this new  doctrine was preached  you would then know the change that it has  wrought in the world  how this or that text should be construed is a  matter of no moment  however warm men may get over it  what is of the  very greatest moment is  that every man should have a good and solid  reason for living a simple  cleanly life  this the christian creed has  given us       i would not have you be virtuous out of fear   he said upon another  occasion   the experience of a long life has taught me  however  that  sin is always punished in this world  whatever may come in the next   there is always some penalty in health  in comfort  or in peace of  mind to be paid for every wrong  it is with nations as it is with  individuals  a book of history is a book of sermons  see how the  luxurious babylonians were destroyed by the frugal persians  and how  these same persians when they learned the vices of prosperity were put  to the sword by the greeks  read on and mark how the sensual greeks were  trodden down by the more robust and hardier romans  and finally how the  romans  having lost their manly virtues  were subdued by the nations  of the north  vice and destruction came ever hand in hand  thus did  providence use each in turn as a scourge wherewith to chastise the  follies of the other  these things do not come by chance  they are part  of a great system which is at work in your own lives  the longer you  live the more you will see that sin and sadness are never far apart  and  that no true prosperity can exist away from virtue      a very different teacher was the sea dog solomon sprent  who lived in  the second last cottage on the left hand side of the main street of the  village  he was one of the old tarpaulin breed  who had fought under  the red cross ensign against frenchman  don  dutchman  and moor  until a  round shot carried off his foot and put an end to his battles for ever   in person he was thin  and hard  and brown  as lithe and active as a  cat  with a short body and very long arms  each ending in a great hand  which was ever half closed as though shutting on a rope  from head to  foot he was covered with the most marvellous tattooings  done in blue   red  and green  beginning with the creation upon his neck and winding up  with the ascension upon his left ankle  never have i seen such a walking  work of art  he was wont to say that had he been owned and his body cast  up upon some savage land  the natives might have learned the whole of  the blessed gospel from a contemplation of his carcass  yet with sorrow  i must say that the seaman s religion appeared to have all worked into  his skin  so that very little was left for inner use  it had broken out  upon the surface  like the spotted fever  but his system was clear of  it elsewhere  he could swear in eleven languages and three and twenty  dialects  nor did he ever let his great powers rust for want of  practice  he would swear when he was happy or when he was sad  when he  was angry or when he was loving  but this swearing was so mere a trick  of speech  without malice or bitterness  that even my father could  hardly deal harshly with the sinner  as time passed  however  the old  man grew more sober and more thoughtful  until in his latter days he  went back to the simple beliefs of his childhood  and learned to fight  the devil with the same steady courage with which he had faced the  enemies of his country     old solomon was a never failing source of amusement and of interest to  my friend lockarby and myself  on gala days he would have us in to dine  with him  when he would regale us with lobscouse and salmagundi  or  perhaps with an outland dish  a pillaw or olla podrida  or fish broiled  after the fashion of the azores  for he had a famous trick of cooking   and could produce the delicacies of all nations  and all the time that  we were with him he would tell us the most marvellous stories of rupert   under whom he served  how he would shout from the poop to his squadron  to wheel to the right  or to charge  or to halt  as the case might be   as if he were still with his regiment of horse  of blake  too  he had  many stories to tell  but even the name of blake was not so dear to our  old sailor as was that of sir christopher mings  solomon had at one time  been his coxswain  and could talk by the hour of those gallant deeds  which had distinguished him from the day that he entered the navy as a  cabin boy until he fell upon his own quarter deck  a full admiral of the  red  and was borne by his weeping ship s company to his grave in chatham  churchyard   if so be as there s a jasper sea up aloft   said the old  seaman   i ll wager that sir christopher will see that the english flag  has proper respect paid to it upon it  and that we are not fooled by  foreigners  i ve served under him in this world  and i ask nothing  better than to be his coxswain in the next  if so be as he should chance  to have a vacancy for such   these remembrances would always end in the  brewing of an extra bowl of punch  and the drinking of a solemn bumper  to the memory of the departed hero     stirring as were solomon sprent s accounts of his old commanders  their  effect upon us was not so great as when  about his second or third  glass  the floodgates of his memory would be opened  and he would pour  out long tales of the lands which he had visited  and the peoples which  he had seen  leaning forward in our seats with our chins resting upon  our hands  we two youngsters would sit for hours  with our eyes fixed  upon the old adventurer  drinking in his words  while he  pleased at the  interest which he excited  would puff slowly at his pipe and reel off  story after story of what he had seen or done  in those days  my dears   there was no defoe to tell us the wonders of the world  no  spectator   to lie upon our breakfast table  no gulliver to satisfy our love of  adventure by telling us of such adventures as never were  not once in  a month did a common newsletter fall into our hands  personal hazards   therefore  were of more value then than they are now  and the talk of a  man like old solomon was a library in itself  to us it was all real  his  husky tones and ill chosen words were as the voice of an angel  and our  eager minds filled in the details and supplied all that was wanting in  his narratives  in one evening we have engaged a sallee rover off the  pillars of hercules  we have coasted down the shores of the african  continent  and seen the great breakers of the spanish main foaming upon  the yellow sand  we have passed the black ivory merchants with their  human cargoes  we have faced the terrible storms which blow ever around  the cape de boa esperanza  and finally  we have sailed away out over the  great ocean beyond  amid the palm clad coral islands  with the knowledge  that the realms of prester john lie somewhere behind the golden haze  which shimmers upon the horizon  after such a flight as that we would  feel  as we came back to the hampshire village and the dull realities  of country life  like wild birds who had been snared by the fowler and  clapped into narrow cages  then it was that the words of my father   you  will find your wings some day and fly away   would come back to me  and  set up such a restlessness as all the wise words of zachary palmer could  not allay       chapter iv  of the strange fish that we caught at spithead    one evening in the month of may       about the end of the first week  of the month  my friend reuben lockarby and i borrowed ned marley s  pleasure boat  and went a fishing out of langston bay  at that time i  was close on one and twenty years of age  while my companion was one  year younger  a great intimacy had sprung up between us  founded on  mutual esteem  for he being a little undergrown man was proud of my  strength and stature  while my melancholy and somewhat heavy spirit took  a pleasure in the energy and joviality which never deserted him  and  in the wit which gleamed as bright and as innocent as summer lightning  through all that he said  in person he was short and broad  round faced   ruddy cheeked  and in truth a little inclined to be fat  though he would  never confess to more than a pleasing plumpness  which was held  he  said  to be the acme of manly beauty amongst the ancients  the stern  test of common danger and mutual hardship entitle me to say that no  man could have desired a stauncher or more trusty comrade  as he was  destined to be with me in the sequel  it was but fitting that he should  have been at my side on that may evening which was the starting point of  our adventures     we pulled out beyond the warner sands to a place half way between them  and the nab  where we usually found bass in plenty  there we cast the  heavy stone which served us as an anchor overboard  and proceeded to  set our lines  the sun sinking slowly behind a fog bank had slashed the  whole western sky with scarlet streaks  against which the wooded slopes  of the isle of wight stood out vaporous and purple  a fresh breeze was  blowing from the south east  flecking the long green waves with crests  of foam  and filling our eyes and lips with the smack of the salt spray   over near st  helen s point a king s ship was making her way down the  channel  while a single large brig was tacking about a quarter of a mile  or less from where we lay  so near were we that we could catch a glimpse  of the figures upon her deck as she heeled over to the breeze  and could  bear the creaking of her yards and the flapping of her weather stained  canvas as she prepared to go about      look ye  micah   said my companion  looking up from his fishing line    that is a most weak minded ship  a ship which will make no way in the  world  see how she hangs in the wind  neither keeping on her course nor  tacking  she is a trimmer of the seas  the lord halifax of the ocean       why  there is something amiss with her   i replied  staring across with  hand shaded eyes   she yaws about as though there were no one at the  helm  her main yard goes aback  now it is forward again  the folk on her  deck seem to me to be either fighting or dancing  up with the anchor   reuben  and let us pull to her       up with the anchor and let us get out of her way   he answered  still  gazing at the stranger   why will you ever run that meddlesome head of  yours into danger s way  she flies dutch colours  but who can say whence  she really comes  a pretty thing if we were snapped up by a buccaneer  and sold in the plantations       a buccaneer in the solent   cried i derisively   we shall be seeing the  black flag in emsworth creek next  but hark  what is that      the crack of a musket sounded from aboard the brig  then came a moment s  silence and another musket shot rang out  followed by a chorus of shouts  and cries  simultaneously the yards swung round into position  the sails  caught the breeze once more  and the vessel darted away on a course  which would take her past bembridge point out to the english channel  as  she flew along her helm was put hard down  a puff of smoke shot out  from her quarter  and a cannon ball came hopping and splashing over  the waves  passing within a hundred yards of where we lay  with this  farewell greeting she came up into the wind again and continued her  course to the southward      heart o  grace   ejaculated reuben in loose lipped astonishment   the  murdering villains       i would to the lord that king s ship would snap them up   cried i  savagely  for the attack was so unprovoked that it stirred my bile    what could the rogues have meant  they are surely drunk or mad       pull at the anchor  man  pull at the anchor   my companion shouted   springing up from the seat   i understand it  pull at the anchor       what then   i asked  helping him to haul the great stone up  hand over  hand  until it came dripping over the side      they were not firing at us  lad  they were aiming at some one in the  water between us and them  pull  micah  put your back into it  some poor  fellow may he drowning       why  i declare   said i  looking over my shoulder as i rowed   there  is his head upon the crest of a wave  easy  or we shall be over him  two  more strokes and be ready to seize him  keep up  friend  there s help at  hand       take help to those who need help  said a voice out of the sea   zounds   man  keep a guard on your oar  i fear a pat from it very much more than  i do the water      these words were delivered in so calm and self possessed a tone that all  concern for the swimmer was set at rest  drawing in our oars we faced  round to have a look at him  the drift of the boat had brought us so  close that he could have grasped the gunwale had he been so minded      sapperment   he cried in a peevish voice   to think of my brother nonus  serving me such a trick  what would our blessed mother have said could  she have seen it  my whole kit gone  to say nothing of my venture in  the voyage  and now i have kicked off a pair of new jack boots that  cost sixteen rix dollars at vanseddar s at amsterdam  i can t swim in  jack boots  nor can i walk without them       won t you come in out of the wet  sir   asked reuben  who could scarce  keep serious at the stranger s appearance and address  a pair of long  arms shot out of the water  and in a moment  with a lithe  snake like  motion  the man wound himself into the boat and coiled his great length  upon the stern sheets  very lanky he was and very thin  with a craggy  hard face  clean shaven and sunburned  with a thousand little wrinkles  intersecting it in every direction  he had lost his hat  and his short  wiry hair  slightly flecked with grey  stood up in a bristle all over  his head  it was hard to guess at his age  but he could scarce have been  under his fiftieth year  though the ease with which he had boarded our  boat proved that his strength and energy were unimpaired  of all his  characteristics  however  nothing attracted my attention so much as his  eyes  which were almost covered by their drooping lids  and yet looked  out through the thin slits which remained with marvellous brightness and  keenness  a passing glance might give the idea that he was languid and  half asleep  but a closer one would reveal those glittering  shifting  lines of light  and warn the prudent man not to trust too much to his  first impressions      i could swim to portsmouth   he remarked  rummaging in the pockets of  his sodden jacket   i could swim well nigh anywhere  i once swam from  gran on the danube to buda  while a hundred thousand janissaries  danced with rage on the nether bank  i did  by the keys of st  peter   wessenburg s pandours would tell you whether decimus saxon could  swim  take my advice  young men  and always carry your tobacco in a  water tight metal box      as he spoke he drew a flat box from his pocket  and several wooden  tubes  which he screwed together to form a long pipe  this he stuffed  with tobacco  and having lit it by means of a flint and steel with a  piece of touch paper from the inside of his box  he curled his legs  under him in eastern fashion  and settled down to enjoy a smoke  there  was something so peculiar about the whole incident  and so preposterous  about the man s appearance and actions  that we both broke into a roar  of laughter  which lasted until for very exhaustion we were compelled  to stop  he neither joined in our merriment nor expressed offence at  it  but continued to suck away at his long wooden tube with a perfectly  stolid and impassive face  save that the half covered eyes glinted  rapidly backwards and forwards from one to the other of us      you will excuse our laughter  sir   i said at last   my friend and i  are unused to such adventures  and are merry at the happy ending of it   may we ask whom it is that we have picked up       decimus saxon is my name   the stranger answered   i am the tenth child  of a worthy father  as the latin implies  there are but nine betwixt me  and an inheritance  who knows  small pox might do it  or the plague       we heard a shot aboard of the brig   said reuben      that was my brother nonus shooting at me   the stranger observed   shaking his head sadly      but there was a second shot       ah  that was me shooting at my brother nonus       good lack   i cried   i trust that thou hast done him no hurt       but a flesh wound  at the most   he answered   i thought it best to  come away  however  lest the affair grow into a quarrel  i am sure that  it was he who trained the nine pounder on me when i was in the water   it came near enough to part my hair  he was always a good shot with a  falconet or a mortar piece  he could not have been hurt  however  to get  down from the poop to the main deck in the time      there was a pause after this  while the stranger drew a long knife from  his belt  and cleaned out his pipe with it  reuben and i took up our  oars  and having pulled up our tangled fishing lines  which had been  streaming behind the boat  we proceeded to pull in towards the land      the question now is   said the stranger   where we are to go to       we are going down langston bay   i answered      oh  we are  are we   he cried  in a mocking voice   you are sure of it  eh  you are certain we are not going to france  we have a mast and sail  there  i see  and water in the beaker  all we want are a few fish   which i hear are plentiful in these waters  and we might make a push for  barfleur       we are going down langston bay   i repeated coldly      you see might is right upon the waters   he explained  with a smile  which broke his whole face up into crinkles   i am an old soldier  a  tough fighting man  and you are two raw lads  i have a knife  and you  are unarmed  d ye see the line of argument  the question now is  where  are we to go      i faced round upon him with the oar in my hand   you boasted that you  could swim to portsmouth   said i   and so you shall  into the water  with you  you sea viper  or i ll push you in as sure as my name is micah  clarke       throw your knife down  or i ll drive the boat hook through you   cried  reuben  pushing it forward to within a few inches of the man s throat      sink me  but this is most commendable   he said  sheathing his weapon   and laughing softly to himself   i love to draw spirit out of the young  fellows  i am the steel  d ye see  which knocks the valour out of your  flint  a notable simile  and one in every way worthy of that most witty  of mankind  samuel butler  this   he continued  tapping a protuberance  which i had remarked over his chest   is not a natural deformity  but is  a copy of that inestimable  hudibras   which combines the light touch  of horace with the broader mirth of catullus  heh  what think you of the  criticism       give up that knife   said i sternly      certainly   he replied  handing it over to me with a polite bow   is  there any other reasonable matter in which i can oblige ye  i will  give up anything to do ye pleasure save only my good name and soldierly  repute  or this same copy of  hudibras   which  together with a latin  treatise upon the usages of war  written by a fleming and printed in  liege in the lowlands  i do ever bear in my bosom      i sat down beside him with the knife in my hand   you pull both oars    i said to reuben   i ll keep guard over the fellow and see that he plays  us no trick  i believe that you are right  and that he is nothing better  than a pirate  he shall be given over to the justices when we get to  havant      i thought that our passenger s coolness deserted him for a moment  and  that a look of annoyance passed over his face      wait a bit   he said   your name  i gather is clarke  and your home is  havant  are you a kinsman of joseph clarke  the old roundhead of that  town       he is my father   i answered      hark to that  now   he cried  with a throb of laughter   i have a  trick of falling on my feet  look at this  lad  look at this   he drew  a packet of letters from his inside pocket  wrapped in a bit of tarred  cloth  and opening it he picked one out and placed it upon my knee    read   said he  pointing at it with his long thin finger     it was inscribed in large plain characters   to joseph clarke  leather  merchant of havant  by the hand of master decimus saxon  part owner of  the ship  providence   from amsterdam to portsmouth   at each side it  was sealed with a massive red seal  and was additionally secured with a  broad band of silk      i have three and twenty of them to deliver in the neighbourhood   he  remarked   that shows what folk think of decimus saxon  three and twenty  lives and liberties are in my hands  ah  lad  invoices and bills of  lading are not done up in that fashion  it is not a cargo of flemish  skins that is coming for the old man  the skins have good english hearts  in them  ay  and english swords in their fists to strike out for freedom  and for conscience  i risk my life in carrying this letter to your  father  and you  his son  threaten to hand me over to the justices  for  shame  for shame  i blush for you       i don t know what you are hinting at   i answered   you must speak  plainer if i am to understand you       can we trust him   he asked  jerking his head in the direction of  reuben      as myself       how very charming   said he  with something between a smile and  a sneer   david and jonathan  or  to be more classical and less  scriptural  damon and pythias  eh   these papers  then  are from the  faithful abroad  the exiles in holland  ye understand  who are thinking  of making a move and of coming over to see king james in his own country  with their swords strapped on their thighs  the letters are to those  from whom they expect sympathy  and notify when and where they will make  a landing  now  my dear lad  you will perceive that instead of my being  in your power  you are so completely in mine that it needs but a word  from me to destroy your whole family  decimus saxon is staunch  though   and that word shall never be spoken       if all this be true   said i   and if your mission is indeed as you  have said  why did you even now propose to make for france       aptly asked  and yet the answer is clear enough   he replied   sweet  and ingenuous as are your faces  i could not read upon them that ye  would prove to be whigs and friends of the good old cause  ye might have  taken me to where excisemen or others would have wanted to pry and peep   and so endangered my commission  better a voyage to france in an open  boat than that       i will take you to my father   said i  after a few moments  thought    you can deliver your letter and make good your story to him  if you  are indeed a true man  you will meet with a warm welcome  but should you  prove  as i shrewdly suspect  to be a rogue  you need expect no mercy       bless the youngster  he speaks like the lord high chancellor of  england  what is it the old man says                he could not ope             his mouth  but out there fell a trope      but it should be a threat  which is the ware in which you are fond of  dealing                he could not let             a minute pass without a threat      how s that  eh  waller himself could not have capped the couplet  neater      all this time reuben had been swinging away at his oars  and we had made  our way into langston bay  down the sheltered waters of which we were  rapidly shooting  sitting in the sheets  i turned over in my mind  all that this waif had said  i had glanced over his shoulder at the  addresses of some of the letters  steadman of basingstoke  wintle  of alresford  fortescue of bognor  all well known leaders of the  dissenters  if they were what he represented them to be  it was no  exaggeration to say that he held the fortunes and fates of these men  entirely in his hands  government would be only too glad to have a valid  reason for striking hard at the men whom they feared  on the whole it  was well to tread carefully in the matter  so i restored our prisoner s  knife to him  and treated him with increased consideration  it was  well nigh dark when we beached the boat  and entirely so before we  reached havant  which was fortunate  as the bootless and hatless state  of our dripping companion could not have failed to set tongues wagging   and perhaps to excite the inquiries of the authorities  as it was  we  scarce met a soul before reaching my father s door         chapter v  of the man with the drooping lids    my mother and my father were sitting in their high backed chairs on  either side of the empty fireplace when we arrived  he smoking his  evening pipe of oronooko  and she working at her embroidery  the moment  that i opened the door the man whom i had brought stepped briskly in   and bowing to the old people began to make glib excuses for the lateness  of his visit  and to explain the manner in which we had picked him up  i  could not help smiling at the utter amazement expressed upon my mother s  face as she gazed at him  for the loss of his jack boots exposed a pair  of interminable spindle shanks which were in ludicrous contrast to the  baggy low country knee breeches which surmounted them  his tunic was  made of coarse sad coloured kersey stuff with flat new gilded brass  buttons  beneath which was a whitish callamanca vest edged with silver   round the neck of his coat was a broad white collar after the dutch  fashion  out of which his long scraggy throat shot upwards with his  round head and bristle of hair balanced upon the top of it  like the  turnip on a stick at which we used to throw at the fairs  in this guise  he stood blinking and winking in the glare of light  and pattering out  his excuses with as many bows and scrapes as sir peter witling in the  play  i was in the act of following him into the room  when reuben  plucked at my sleeve to detain me      nay  i won t come in with you  micah   said he   there s mischief  likely to come of all this  my father may grumble over his beer jugs   but he s a churchman and a tantivy for all that  i d best keep out of  it       you are right   i answered   there is no need for you to meddle in the  business  be mum as to all that you have heard       mum as a mouse   said he  and pressing my hand turned away into the  darkness  when i returned to the sitting room i found that my mother had  hurried into the kitchen  where the crackling of sticks showed that she  was busy in building a fire  decimus saxon was seated at the edge of  the iron bound oak chest at the side of my father  and was watching him  keenly with his little twinkling eyes  while the old man was fixing  his horn glasses and breaking the seals of the packet which his strange  visitor had just handed to him     i saw that when my father looked at the signature at the end of the  long  closely written letter he gave a whiff of surprise and sat  motionless for a moment or so staring at it  then he turned to the  commencement and read it very carefully through  after which he turned  it over and read it again  clearly it brought no unwelcome news  for his  eyes sparkled with joy when he looked up from his reading  and more than  once he laughed aloud  finally he asked the man saxon how it had come  into his possession  and whether he was aware of the contents      why  as to that   said the messenger   it was handed to me by no less  a person than dicky rumbold himself  and in the presence of others whom  it s not for me to name  as to the contents  your own sense will tell  you that i would scarce risk my neck by bearing a message without i  knew what the message was  i am no chicken at the trade  sir  cartels    pronunciamientos   challenges  flags of truce  and proposals for  waffenstillstands  as the deutschers call it  they ve all gone through  my hands  and never one  gone awry       indeed   quoth my father   you are yourself one of the faithful       i trust that i am one of those who are on the narrow and thorny track    said he  speaking through his nose  as was the habit of the extreme  sectaries      a track upon which no prelate can guide us   said my father      where man is nought and the lord is all   rejoined saxon      good  good   cried my father   micah  you shall take this worthy man  to my room  and see that he hath dry linen  and my second best suit of  utrecht velvet  it may serve until his own are dried  my boots  too   may perchance be useful  my riding ones of untanned leather  a hat with  silver braiding hangs above them in the cupboard  see that he lacks for  nothing which the house can furnish  supper will be ready when he hath  changed his attire  i beg that you will go at once  good master saxon   lest you take a chill       there is but one thing that we have omitted   said our visitor   solemnly rising up from his chair and clasping his long nervous hands  together   let us delay no longer to send up a word of praise to the  almighty for his manifold blessings  and for the mercy wherewith he  plucked me and my letters out of the deep  even as jonah was saved from  the violence of the wicked ones who hurled him overboard  and it may be  fired falconets at him  though we are not so informed in holy writ  let  us pray  my friends   then in a high toned chanting voice he offered up  a long prayer of thanksgiving  winding up with a petition for grace and  enlightenment for the house and all its inmates  having concluded by a  sonorous amen  he at last suffered himself to be led upstairs  while  my mother  who had slipped in and listened with much edification to his  words  hurried away to prepare him a bumper of green usquebaugh with ten  drops of daffy s elixir therein  which was her sovereign recipe against  the effects of a soaking  there was no event in life  from a christening  to a marriage  but had some appropriate food or drink in my mother s  vocabulary  and no ailment for which she had not some pleasant cure in  her well stocked cupboards     master decimus saxon in my father s black utrecht velvet and untanned  riding boots looked a very different man to the bedraggled castaway who  had crawled like a conger eel into our fishing boat  it seemed as if he  had cast off his manner with his raiment  for he behaved to my mother  during supper with an air of demure gallantry which sat upon him better  than the pert and flippant carriage which he had shown towards us in the  boat  truth to say  if he was now more reserved  there was a very good  reason for it  for he played such havoc amongst the eatables that there  was little time for talk  at last  after passing from the round of cold  beef to a capon pasty  and topping up with a two pound perch  washed  down by a great jug of ale  he smiled upon us all and told us that his  fleshly necessities were satisfied for the nonce   it is my rule   he  remarked   to obey the wise precept which advises a man to rise from  table feeling that he could yet eat as much as he has partaken of       i gather from your words  sir  that you have yourself seen hard  service   my father remarked when the board had been cleared and my  mother had retired for the night      i am an old fighting man   our visitor answered  screwing his pipe  together   a lean old dog of the hold fast breed  this body of mine  bears the mark of many a cut and slash received for the most part in  the service of the protestant faith  though some few were caught for the  sake of christendom in general when warring against the turk  there is  blood of mine  sir  spotted all over the map of europe  some of it  i  confess  was spilled in no public cause  but for the protection of mine  own honour in the private duello or holmgang  as it was called among the  nations of the north  it is necessary that a cavaliero of fortune  being  for the greater part a stranger in a strange land  should be somewhat  nice in matters of the sort  since he stands  as it were  as the  representative of his country  whose good name should be more dear to  him than his own       your weapon on such occasions was  i suppose  the sword   my father  asked  shifting uneasily in his seat  as he would do when his old  instincts were waking up      broadsword  rapier  toledo  spontoon  battle axe  pike or half pike   morgenstiern  and halbert  i speak with all due modesty  but with  backsword  sword and dagger  sword and buckler  single falchion  case of  falchions  or any other such exercise  i will hold mine own against any  man that ever wore neat s leather  save only my elder brother quartus       by my faith   said my father with his eyes shining   were i twenty  years younger i should have at you  my backsword play hath been thought  well of by stout men of war  god forgive me that my heart should still  turn to such vanities       i have heard godly men speak well of it   remarked saxon   master  richard rumbold himself spake of your deeds of arms to the duke of  argyle  was there not a scotsman  one storr or stour       ay  ay  storr of drumlithie  i cut him nigh to the saddle bow in a  skirmish on the eve of dunbar  so dicky rumbold had not forgotten it   eh  he was a hard one both at praying and at fighting  we have ridden  knee to knee in the field  and we have sought truth together in the  chamber  so  dick will be in harness once again  he could not be still  if a blow were to be struck for the trampled faith  if the tide of war  set in this direction  i too  who knows  who knows       and here is a stout man at arms   said saxon  passing his hand down my  arm   he hath thew and sinew  and can use proud words too upon occasion   as i have good cause to know  even in our short acquaintance  might it  not be that he too should strike in this quarrel       we shall discuss it   my father answered  looking thoughtfully at me  from under his heavy brows   but i pray you  friend saxon  to give us  some further account upon these matters  my son micah  as i understand   hath picked you out of the waves  how came you there      decimus saxon puffed at his pipe for a minute or more in silence  as one  who is marshalling facts each in its due order      it came about in this wise   he said at last   when john of poland  chased the turk from the gates of vienna  peace broke out in the  principalities  and many a wandering cavaliero like myself found his  occupation gone  there was no war waging save only some petty italian  skirmish  in which a soldier could scarce expect to reap either dollars  or repute  so i wandered across the continent  much cast down at the  strange peace which prevailed in every quarter  at last  however  on  reaching the lowlands  i chanced to hear that the  providence   owned  and commanded by my two brothers  nonus and quartus  was about to start  from amsterdam for an adventure to the guinea coast  i proposed to them  that i should join them  and was accordingly taken into partnership on  condition that i paid one third of the cost of the cargo  while waiting  at the port i chanced to come across some of the exiles  who  having  heard of my devotion to the protestant cause  brought me to the duke and  to master rumbold  who committed these letters to my charge  this makes  it clear how they came into my possession       but not how you and they came into the water   my father suggested      why  that was but the veriest chance   the adventurer answered with  some little confusion of manner   it was the  fortuna belli   or more  properly  pacis   i had asked my brothers to put into portsmouth that i  might get rid of these letters  on which they replied in a boorish and  unmannerly fashion that they were still waiting for the thousand guineas  which represented my share of the venture  to this i answered with  brotherly familiarity that it was a small thing  and should be paid  for out of the profits of our enterprise  their reply was i that i had  promised to pay the money down  and that money down they must have  i  then proceeded to prove  both by the aristotelian and by the platonic  or deductive method  that having no guineas in my possession it was  impossible for me to produce a thousand of them  at the same time  pointing out that the association of an honest man in the business was  in itself an ample return for the money  since their own reputations had  been somewhat blown on  i further offered in the same frank and friendly  spirit to meet either of them with sword or with pistol  a proposal  which should have satisfied any honour loving cavaliero  their base  mercantile souls prompted them  however  to catch up two muskets  one of  which nonus discharged at me  and it is likely that quartus would have  followed suit had i not plucked the gun from his hand and unloaded it to  prevent further mischief  in unloading it i fear that one of the slugs  blew a hole in brother nonus  seeing that there was a chance of further  disagreements aboard the vessel  i at once decided to leave her  in  doing which i was forced to kick off my beautiful jack boots  which were  said by vanseddars himself to be he finest pair that ever went out of  his shop  square toed  double soled  alas  alas       strange that you should have been picked up by the son of the very man  to whom you had a letter       the working of providence   saxon answered   i have two and twenty  other letters which must all be delivered by hand  if you will permit me  to use your house for a while  i shall make it my headquarters       use it as though it were your own   said my father      your most grateful servant  sir   he cried  jumping up and bowing  with his hand over his heart   this is indeed a haven of rest after the  ungodly and profane company of my brothers  shall we then put up a hymn   and retire from the business of the day      my father willingly agreed  and we sang  oh  happy land   after which  our visitor followed me to his room  bearing with him the unfinished  bottle of usquebaugh which my mother had left on the table  he took it  with him  he explained  as a precaution against persian ague  contracted  while battling against the ottoman  and liable to recur at strange  moments  i left him in our best spare bedroom  and returned to my  father  who was still seated  heavy with thought  in his old corner      what think you of my find  dad   i asked      a man of parts and of piety   he answered   but in truth he has brought  me news so much after my heart  that he could not be unwelcome were he  the pope of rome       what news  then       this  this   he cried joyously  plucking the letter out of his bosom    i will read it to you  lad  nay  perhaps i had best sleep the night  upon it  and read it to morrow when our heads are clearer  may the lord  guide my path  and confound the tyrant  pray for light  boy  for my life  and yours may be equally at stake            chapter vi  of the letter that came from the lowlands    in the morning i was up betimes  and went forthwith  after the country  fashion  to our quest s room to see if there was aught in which i could  serve him  on pushing at his door  i found that it was fastened  which  surprised me the more as i knew that there was neither key nor bolt upon  the inside  on my pressing against it  however  it began to yield  and  i could then see that a heavy chest which was used to stand near the  window had been pulled round in order to shut out any intrusion  this  precaution  taken under my father s roof  as though he were in a den of  thieves  angered me  and i gave a butt with my shoulder which cleared  the box out of the way  and enabled me to enter the room     the man saxon was sitting up in bed  staring about him as though he  were not very certain for the moment where he was  he had tied a white  kerchief round his head by way of night bonnet  and his hard visaged   clean shaven face  looking out through this  together with his bony  figure  gave him some resemblance to a gigantic old woman  the bottle  of usquebaugh stood empty by his bedside  clearly his fears had been  realised  and he had had an attack of the persian ague      ah  my young friend   he said at last   is it  then  the custom of this  part of the country to carry your visitor s rooms by storm or escalado  in the early hours of the morning       is it the custom   i answered sternly   to barricade up your door when  you are sleeping under the roof tree of an honest man  what did you  fear  that you should take such a precaution       nay  you are indeed a spitfire   he replied  sinking back upon the  pillow  and drawing the clothes round him   a feuerkopf as the germans  call it  or sometimes tollkopf  which in its literal significance  meaneth a fool s head  your father was  as i have heard  a strong and a  fierce man when the blood of youth ran in his veins  but you  i should  judge  are in no way behind him  know  then  that the bearer of papers  of import   documenta preciosa sed periculosa   is bound to leave  nought to chance  but to guard in every way the charge which hath been  committed to him  true it is that i am in the house of an honest man   but i know not who may come or who may go during the hours of the night   indeed  for the matter of that  but enough is said  i shall be with you  anon       your clothes are dry and are ready for you   i remarked      enough  enough   he answered   i have no quarrel with the suit which  your father has lent me  it may be that i have been used to better  but  they will serve my turn  the camp is not the court      it was evident to me that my father s suit was infinitely better  both  in texture and material  than that which our visitor had brought  with him  as he had withdrawn his head  however  entirely beneath the  bedclothes  there was nothing more to be said  so i descended to the  lower room  where i found toy father busily engaged fastening a new  buckle to his sword belt while my mother and the maid were preparing the  morning meal      come into the yard with me  micah   quoth my father   i would have  a word with you   the workmen had not yet come to their work  so we  strolled out into the sweet morning air  and seated ourselves on the low  stone bankment on which the skins are dressed      i have been out here this morning trying my hand at the broadsword  exercise   said he   i find that i am as quick as ever on a thrust  but  my cuts are sadly stiff  i might be of use at a pinch  but  alas  i  am not the same swordsman who led the left troop of the finest horse  regiment that ever followed a kettledrum  the lord hath given  and the  lord hath taken away  yet  if i am old and worn  there is the fruit of  my loins to stand in my place and to wield the same sword in the same  cause  you shall go in my place  micah       go  go whither       hush  lad  and listen  let not your mother know too much  for the  hearts of women are soft  when abraham offered up his eldest born  i  trow that he said little to sarah on the matter  here is the letter   know you who this dicky rumbold is       surely i have heard you speak of him as an old companion of yours       the same  a staunch man and true  so faithful was he  faithful even to  slaying  that when the army of the righteous dispersed  he did not lay  aside his zeal with his buff coat  he took to business as a maltster at  hoddesdon  and in his house was planned the famous rye house plot  in  which so many good men were involved       was it not a foul assassination plot   i asked      nay  nay  be not led away by terms  it is a vile invention of the  malignants that these men planned assassination  what they would do they  purposed doing in broad daylight  thirty of them against fifty of the  royal guard  when charles and james passed on their way to newmarket  if  the royal brothers got pistol bullet or sword stab  it would be in open  fight  and at the risk of their attackers  it was give and take  and no  murder      he paused and looked inquiringly at me  but i could not truthfully  say that i was satisfied  for an attack upon the lives of unarmed and  unsuspecting men  even though surrounded by a bodyguard  could not  to  my mind  be justified      when the plot failed   my father continued   rumbold had to fly for his  life  but he succeeded in giving his pursuers the slip and in making his  way to the lowlands  there he found that many enemies of the government  had gathered together  repeated messages from england  especially from  the western counties and from london  assured them that if they would  but attempt an invasion they might rely upon help both in men and in  money  they were  however  at fault for some time for want of a leader  of sufficient weight to carry through so large a project  but now  at last they have one  who is the best that could have been singled  out  none other than the well beloved protestant chieftain james  duke  of monnmouth  son of charles ii       illegitimate son   i remarked      that may or may not be  there are those who say that lucy walters was  a lawful wife  bastard or no  he holds the sound principles of the true  church  and he is beloved by the people  let him appear in the west  and  soldiers will rise up like the flowers in the spring time      he paused  and led me away to the farther end of the yard  for the  workmen had begun to arrive and to cluster round the dipping trough      monmouth is coming over   he continued   and he expects every brave  protestant man to rally to his standard  the duke of argyle is to  command a separate expedition  which will set the highlands of scotland  in a blaze  between them they hope to bring the persecutor of the  faithful on his knees  but i hear the voice of the man saxon  and i must  not let him say that i have treated him in a churlish fashion  here is  the letter  lad  read it with care  and remember that when brave men are  striving for their rights it is fitting that one of the old rebel house  of clarke should be among them      i took the letter  and wandering off into the fields  i settled myself  under a convenient tree  and set myself to read it  this yellow sheet  which i now hold in my hand is the very one which was brought by decimus  saxon  and read by me that bright may morning under the hawthorn shade   i give it to you as it stands        to my friend and companion in the cause of the lord  joseph  clarke   know  friend  that aid and delivery is coming upon israel   and that the wicked king and those who uphold him shall be smitten and  entirely cast down  until their place in the land shall know them no  more  hasten  then  to testify to thy own faith  that in the day of  trouble ye be not found wanting      it has chanced from time to time that many of the suffering church   both from our own land and from among the scots  have assembled in this  good lutheran town of amsterdam  until enough are gathered together to  take a good work in hand  for amongst our own folk there are my  lord grey of wark  wade  dare of taunton  ayloffe  holmes  hollis   goodenough  and others whom thou shalt know  of the scots there are the  duke of argyle  who has suffered sorely for the covenant  sir patrick  hume  fletcher of saltoun  sir john cochrane  dr  ferguson  major  elphinstone  and others  to these we would fain have added locke and old  hal ludlow  but they are  as those of the laodicean church  neither cold  nor warm      it has now come to pass  however  that monmouth  who has long lived in  dalliance with the midianitish woman known by the name of wentworth  has  at last turned him to higher things  and has consented to make a bid for  the crown  it was found that the scots preferred to follow a chieftain  of their own  and it has therefore been determined that argyle  m callum  more  as the breechless savages of inverary call him  shall command a  separate expedition landing upon the western coast of scotland  there  he hopes to raise five thousand campbells  and to be joined by all the  covenanters and western whigs  men who would make troops of the old  breed had they but god fearing officers with an experience of the chance  of fields and the usages of war  with such a following he should be able  to hold glasgow  and to draw away the king s force to the north  ayloffe  and i go with argyle  it is likely that our feet may be upon scottish  ground before thy eyes read these words      the stronger expedition starts with monmouth  and lands at a fitting  place in the west  where we are assured that we have many friends  i  cannot name the spot lest this letter miscarry  but thou shalt hear  anon  i have written to all good men along the coast  bidding them to  be prepared to support the rising  the king is weak  and hated by the  greater part of his subjects  it doth but need one good stroke to bring  his crown in the dust  monmouth will start in a few weeks  when his  equipment is finished and the weather favourable  if thou canst come   mine old comrade  i know well that thou wilt need no bidding of mine to  bring thee to our banner  should perchance a peaceful life and waning  strength forbid thy attendance  i trust that thou wilt wrestle for us  in prayer  even as the holy prophet of old  and perchance  since i hear  that thou hast prospered according to the things of this world  thou  mayst be able to fit out a pikeman or two  or to send a gift towards the  military chest  which will be none too plentifully lined  we trust  not to gold  but to steel and to our own good cause  yet gold will be  welcome none the less  should we fall  we fall like men and christians   should we succeed  we shall see how the perjured james  the persecutor  of the saints with the heart like a nether millstone  the man who smiled  when the thumbs of the faithful were wrenched out of their sockets at  edinburgh  we shall see how manfully he can bear adversity when it falls  to his lot  may the hand of the almighty be over us      i know little of the bearer of this  save that he professes to be of  the elect  shouldst thou go to monmouth s camp  see that thou take him  with thee  for i hear that he hath had good experience in the german   swedish  and otttoman wars   yours in the faith of christ  richard  rumbold      present my services to thy spouse  let her read timothy chapter two   ninth to fifteenth verses        this long letter i read very carefully  and then putting it in my pocket  returned indoors to my breakfast  my father looked at me  as i entered   with questioning eyes  but i had no answer to return him  for my own  mind was clouded and uncertain     that day decimus saxon left us  intending to make a round of the country  and to deliver his letters  but promising to be back again ere long  we  had a small mishap ere he went  for as we were talking of his journey  my brother hosea must needs start playing with my father s powder flask   which in some way went off with a sudden fluff  spattering the walls  with fragments of metal  so unexpected and loud was the explosion   that both my father and i sprang to our feet  but saxon  whose back  was turned to my brother  sat four square in his chair without a glance  behind him or a shade of change in his rugged face  as luck would have  it  no one was injured  not even hosea  but the incident made me think  more highly of our new acquaintance  as he started off down the village  street  his long stringy figure and strange gnarled visage  with my  father s silver braided hat cocked over his eye  attracted rather  more attention than i cared to see  considering the importance of the  missives which he bore  and the certainty of their discovery should he  be arrested as a masterless man  fortunately  however  the curiosity  of the country folk did but lead them to cluster round their doors and  windows  staring open eyed  while he  pleased at the attention which  he excited  strode along with his head in the air and a cudgel of  mine twirling in his hand  he had left golden opinions behind him  my  father s good wishes had been won by his piety and by the sacrifices  which he claimed to have made for the faith  my mother he had taught how  wimples are worn amongst the serbs  and had also demonstrated to her a  new method of curing marigolds in use in some parts of lithuania  for  myself  i confess that i retained a vague distrust of the man  and  was determined to avoid putting faith in him more than was needful  at  present  however  we had no choice hut to treat him as an ambassador  from friends     and i  what was i to do  should i follow my father s wishes  and draw  my maiden sword on behalf of the insurgents  or should i stand aside and  see how events shaped themselves  it was more fitting that i should  go than he  but  on the other hand  i was no keen religious zealot   papistry  church  dissent  i believed that there was good in all of  them  but that not one was worth the spilling of human blood  james  might be a perjurer and a villain  but he was  as far as i could see   the rightful king of england  and no tales of secret marriages or black  boxes could alter the fact that his rival was apparently an illegitimate  son  and as such ineligible to the throne  who could say what evil act  upon the part of a monarch justified his people in setting him aside   who was the judge in such a case  yet  on the other hand  the man had  notoriously broken his own pledges  and that surely should absolve  his subjects from their allegiance  it was a weighty question for a  country bred lad to have to settle  and yet settled it must be  and that  speedily  i took up my hat and wandered away down the village street   turning the matter over in my head     but it was no easy thing for me to think seriously of anything in the  hamlet  for i was in some way  my dear children  though i say it myself   a favourite with the young and with the old  so that i could not walk  ten paces without some greeting or address  there were my own brothers  trailing behind me  baker mitford s children tugging at my skirts  and  the millwright s two little maidens one on either hand  then  when i had  persuaded these young rompers to leave me  out came dame fullarton the  widow  with a sad tale about how her grindstone had fallen out of its  frame  and neither she nor her household could lift it in again  that  matter i set straight and proceeded on my way  but i could not pass the  sign of the wheatsheaf without john lockarby  reuben s father  plunging  out at me and insisting upon my coming in with him for a morning cup      the best glass of mead in the countryside  and brewed under my own  roof   said he proudly  as he poured it into the flagon   why  bless  you  master micah  a man with a frame like yours wants store o  good  malt to keep it up wi        and malt like this is worthy of a good frame to contain it   quoth  reuben  who was at work among the flasks      what think ye  micah   said the landlord   there was the squire o   milton over here yester morning wi  johnny ferneley o  the bank side   and they will have it that there s a man in fareham who could wrestle  you  the best of three  and find your own grip  for a good round stake       tut  tut   i answered   you would have me like a prize mastiff  showing  my teeth to the whole countryside  what matter if the man can throw me   or i him       what matter  why  the honour of havant   quoth he   is that no matter   but you are right   he continued  draining off his horn   what is all  this village life with its small successes to such as you  you are as  much out of your place as a vintage wine at a harvest supper  the whole  of broad england  and not the streets of havant  is the fit stage for  a man of your kidney  what have you to do with the beating of skins and  the tanning of leather       my father would have you go forth as a knight errant  micah   said  reuben  laughing   you might chance to get your own skin beaten and your  own leather tanned       who ever knew so long a tongue in so short a body   cried the  innkeeper   but in good sooth  master micah  i am in sober earnest when  i say that you are indeed wasting the years of your youth  when life is  sparkling and clear  and that you will regret it when you have come to  the flat and flavourless dregs of old age       there spoke the brewer   said reuben   but indeed  micah  my father is  right  for all that he hath such a hops and water manner of putting it       i will think over it   i answered  and with a nod to the kindly couple  proceeded on my way     zachariah palmer was planing a plank as i passed  looking up he bade me  good morrow      i have a book for you  lad   he said      i have but now finished the  comus    i answered  for he had lent me  john milton s poem   but what is this new book  daddy       it is by the learned locke  and treateth of states and statecraft  it  is but a small thing  but if wisdom could show in the scales it would  weigh down many a library  you shall have it when i have finished it   to morrow mayhap or the day after  a good man is master locke  is he not  at this moment a wanderer in the lowlands  rather than bow his knee to  what his conscience approved not of       there are many good men among the exiles  are there not   said i      the pick of the country   he answered   ill fares the land that drives  the highest and bravest of its citizens away from it  the day is coming   i fear  when every man will have to choose betwixt his beliefs and his  freedom  i am an old man  micah boy  but i may live long enough to see  strange things in this once protestant kingdom       but if these exiles had their way   i objected   they would place  monmouth upon the throne  and so unjustly alter the succession       nay  nay   old zachary answered  laying down his plane   if they use  monmouth s name  it is but to strengthen their cause  and to show that  they have a leader of repute  were james driven from the throne  the  commons of england in parliament assembled would be called upon to  name his successor  there are men at monmouth s back who would not stir  unless this were so       then  daddy   said i   since i can trust you  and since you will tell  me what you do really think  would it be well  if monmouth s standard be  raised  that i should join it      the carpenter stroked his white beard and pondered for a while   it is a  pregnant question   he said at last   and yet methinks that there is but  one answer to it  especially for your father s son  should an end be put  to james s rule  it is not too late to preserve the nation in its old  faith  but if the disease is allowed to spread  it may be that even the  tyrant s removal would not prevent his evil seed from sprouting  i hold   therefore  that should the exiles make such an attempt  it is the duty  of every man who values liberty of conscience to rally round them  and  you  my son  the pride of the village  what better use could you make  of your strength than to devote it to helping to relieve your country  of this insupportable yoke  it is treasonable and dangerous  counsel  counsel which might lead to a short shrift and a bloody  death  but  as the lord liveth  if you were child of mine i should say  the same      so spoke the old carpenter with a voice which trembled with earnestness   and went to work upon his plank once more  while i  with a few words of  gratitude  went on my way pondering over what he had said to me  i had  not gone far  however  before the hoarse voice of solomon sprent broke  in upon my meditations      hoy there  ahoy   he bellowed  though his mouth was but a few yards  from my ear   would ye come across my hawse without slacking weigh  clew  up  d ye see  clew up       why  captain   i said   i did not see you  i was lost in thought       all adrift and without look outs   quoth he  pushing his way through  the break in the garden hedge   odd s niggars  man  friends are not  so plentiful  d ye see  that ye need pass  em by without a dip o  the  ensign  so help me  if i had had a barker i d have fired a shot across  your bows       no offence  captain   said i  for the veteran appeared to be nettled    i have much to think of this morning       and so have i  mate   he answered  in a softer voice   what think ye of  my rig  eh   he turned himself slowly round in the sunlight as he spoke   and i perceived that he was dressed with unusual care  he had a blue  suit of broadcloth trimmed with eight rows of buttons  and breeches of  the same material with great bunches of ribbon at the knee  his vest  was of lighter blue picked out with anchors in silver  and edged with  a finger s breadth of lace  his boot was so wide that he might have had  his foot in a bucket  and he wore a cutlass at his side suspended from a  buff belt  which passed over his right shoulder      i ve had a new coat o  paint all over   said he  with a wink    carramba  the old ship is water tight yet  what would ye say  now  were  i about to sling my hawser over a little scow  and take her in tow       a cow   i cried      a cow  what d ye take me for  a wench  man  and as tight a little craft  as ever sailed into the port of wedlock       i have heard no better news for many a long day   said i   i did not  even know that you were betrothed  when thou is the wedding to be       go slow  friend  go slow  and heave your lead line  you have got out  of your channel  and are in shoal water  i never said as how i was  betrothed       what then   i asked      i am getting up anchor now  to run down to her and summon her  look  ye  lad   he continued  plucking off his cap and scratching his  ragged locks   i ve had to do wi  wenches enow from the levant to the  antilles  wenches such as a sailorman meets  who are all paint and  pocket  it s but the heaving of a hand grenade  and they strike their  colours  this is a craft of another guess build  and unless i steer wi   care she may put one in between wind and water before i so much as  know that i am engaged  what think ye  heh  should i lay myself boldly  alongside  d ye see  and ply her with small arms  or should i work  myself clear and try a long range action  i am none of your slippery   grease tongued  long shore lawyers  but if so be as she s willing for a  mate  i ll stand by her in wind and weather while my planks hold out       i can scarce give advice in such a case   said i   for my experience is  less than yours  i should say though that you had best speak to her from  your heart  in plain sailor language       aye  aye  she can take it or leave it  phoebe dawson it is  the sister  of the blacksmith  let us work back and have a drop of the right nants  before we go  i have an anker newly come  which never paid the king a  groat       nay  you had best leave it alone   i answered      say you so  well  mayhap you are right  throw off your moorings  then   and clap on sail  for we must go       but i am not concerned   said i      not concerned  not    he was too much overcome to go on  and could  but look at me with a face full of reproach   i thought better of you   micah  would you let this crazy old hulk go into action  and not stand  by to fire a broadside       what would you have me do then       why  i would have you help me as the occasion may arise  if i start  to board her  i would have you work across the bows so as to rake  her  should i range  up on the larboard quarter  do you lie  on the  starboard  if i get crippled  do you draw her fire until i refit  what   man  you would not desert me      the old seaman s tropes and maritime conceits were not always  intelligible to me  but it was clear that he had set his heart upon my  accompanying him  which i was equally determined not to do  at last  by much reasoning i made him understand that my presence would be more  hindrance than help  and would probably be fatal to his chances of  success      well  well   he grumbled at last   i ve been concerned in no such  expedition before  an  it be the custom for single ships to engage  i ll  stand to it alone  you shall come with me as consort  though  and stand  to and fro in the offing  or sink me if i stir a step      my mind was full of my father s plans and of the courses which lay  before me  there seemed to be no choice  however  as old solomon was  in dead earnest  but to lay the matter aside for the moment and see the  upshot of this adventure      mind  solomon   said i   i don t cross the threshold       aye  aye  mate  you can please yourself  we have to beat up against the  wind all the way  she s on the look out  for i hailed her yesternight   and let her know as how i should bear down on her about seven bells of  the morning watch      i was thinking as we trudged down the road that phoebe would need to be  learned in sea terms to make out the old man s meaning  when he pulled  up short and clapped his hands to his pockets      zounds   he cried   i have forgot to bring a pistol       in heaven s name   i said in amazement   what could you want with a  pistol       why  to make signals with   said he   odds me that i should have forgot  it  how is one s consort to know what is going forward when the flagship  carries no artillery  had the lass been kind i should have fired one  gun  that you might know it       why   i answered   if you come not out i shall judge that all is well   if things go amiss i shall see you soon       aye  or stay  i ll hoist a white jack at the port hole  a white jack  means that she hath hauled down her colours  nombre de dios  when i  was a powder boy in the old ship  lion   the day that we engaged the   spiritus sanctus  of two tier o  guns  the first time that ever i heard  the screech of ball  my heart never thumped as it does now  what say ye  if we run back with a fair wind and broach that anker of nants       nay  stand to it  man   said i  for by this time  we had come to the  ivy clad cottage behind which was the village smithy   what  solomon   an english seaman never feared a foe  either with petticoats or without  them       no  curse me if he did   quoth solomon  squaring his shoulders   never  a one  don  devil  or dutchman  so here goes for her   so saying he made  his way into the cottage  leaving me standing by the garden wicket  half  amused and half annoyed at this interruption to my musings     as it proved  the sailor had no very great difficulty with his suit  and  soon managed to capture his prize  to use his own language  i heard from  the garden the growling of his gruff voice  and a good deal of shrill  laughter ending in a small squeak  which meant  i suppose  that he was  coming to close quarters  then there was silence for a little while  and  at last i saw a white kerchief waving from the window  and perceived   moreover  that it was phoebe herself who was fluttering it  well  she  was a smart  kindly hearted lass  and i was glad in my heart that the  old seaman should have such a one to look after him     here  then  was one good friend settled down finally for life  another  warned me that i was wasting my best years in the hamlet  a third  the  most respected of all  advised me openly to throw in my lot with the  insurgents  should the occasion arise  if i refused  i should have  the shame of seeing my aged father setting off for the wars  whilst  i lingered at home  and why should i refuse  had it not long been the  secret wish of my heart to see something of the great world  and what  fairer chance could present itself  my wishes  my friend s advice  and  my father s hopes all pointed in the one direction      father   said i  when i returned home   i am ready to go where you  will       may the lord be glorified   he cried solemnly   may he watch over  your young life  and keep your heart steadfast to the cause which is  assuredly his      and so  my dear grandsons  the great resolution was taken  and i found  myself committed to one side in the national quarrel         chapter vii  of the horseman who rode from the west    my father set to work forthwith preparing for our equipment  furnishing  saxon out as well as myself on the most liberal scale  for he was  determined that the wealth of his age should be as devoted to the cause  as was the strength of his youth  these arrangements had to be carried  out with the most extreme caution  for there were many prelatists in  the village  and in the present disturbed state of the public mind any  activity on the part of so well known a man would have at once attracted  attention  so carefully did the wary old soldier manage matters   however  that we soon found ourselves in a position to start at an  hour s notice  without any of our neighbours being a whit the wiser     his first move was to purchase through an agent two suitable horses at  chichester fair  which were conveyed to the stables of a trusty whig  farmer living near portchester  who was ordered to keep them until  they were called for  of these animals one was a mottled grey  of great  mettle and power  standing seventeen and a half hands high  and well up  to my weight  for in those days  my dears  i had not laid on flesh  and  weighed a little under sixteen stone for all my height and strength   a critic might have said that covenant  for so i named my steed  was a  trifle heavy about the head and neck  but i found him a trusty  willing  brute  with great power and endurance  saxon  who when fully accoutred  could scarce have weighed more than twelve stone  had a light bay  spanish jennet  of great speed and spirit  this mare he named chloe    after a godly maiden of his acquaintance   though  as my father  remarked  there was a somewhat ungodly and heathenish smack about the  appellation  these horses and their harness were bought and held ready  without my father appearing in the matter in any way     this important point having been settled  there was the further question  of arms to be discussed  which gave rise to much weighty controversy  between decimus saxon and my father  each citing many instances from  their own experiences where the presence or absence of some taslet  or arm guard had been of the deepest import to the wearer  your  great grandfather had set his heart upon my wearing the breastplate  which still bore the dints of the scottish spears at dunbar  but on  trying it on we found it was too small for me  i confess that this was a  surprise  for when i looked back at the awe with which i had regarded  my father s huge proportions  it was marvellous to me to have  this convincing proof that i had outgrown him  by ripping down the  side leather and piercing holes through which a lace could be passed  my  mother managed to arrange it so that i could wear it without discomfort   a pair of taslets or thigh pieces  with guards for the upper arm and  gauntlets  were all borrowed from the old parliamentary equipment   together with the heavy straight sword and pair of horse pistols which  formed the usual weapons of a cavalier  my father had chosen me a  head piece in portsmouth  fluted  with good barrets  padded inside with  soft leather  very light and yet very strong  when fully equipped   both saxon and my father agreed that i had all that was requisite for  a well appointed soldier  saxon had purchased a buff coat  a steel cap   and a pair of jack boots  so that with the rapier and pistols which my  father had presented him with  he was ready to take the field at any  time     there would  we hoped  be no great difficulty in our reaching monmouth s  forces when the hour came  in those troublous times the main roads were  so infested by highwaymen and footpads  that it was usual for travellers  to carry weapons and even armour for their protection  there was no  reason therefore why our appearance should excite suspicion  should  questions be asked  saxon had a long story prepared  to the effect that  we were travelling to join henry somerset  duke of beaufort  to whose  household we belonged  this invention he explained to me  with many  points of corroboration which i was to furnish  but when i said  positively that i should rather be hanged as a rebel than speak a  falsehood  he looked at me open eyed  and shook his head as one much  shocked  a few weeks of campaigning  he said  would soon cure me of my  squeamishness  for himself  no more truthful child had ever carried a  horn book  but he had learned to lie upon the danube  and looked upon  it as a necessary part of the soldier s upbringing   for what are all  stratagems  ambuscades  and outfalls but lying upon a large scale   he  argued   what is an adroit commander but one who hath a facility for  disguising the truth  when  at the battle of senlac  william the norman  ordered his men to feign flight in order that they might break his  enemy s array  a wile much practised both by the scythians of old and by  the croats of our own day  pray what is it but the acting of a lie  or  when hannibal  having tied torches to the horns of great droves of oxen   caused the roman consuls to imagine that his army was in retreat  was it  not a deception or infraction of the truth   a point well brought out  by a soldier of repute in the treatise  an in bello dolo uti liceat   an apud hostes falsiloquio uti liceat   and so if  after these great  models  i in order to gain mine ends do announce that we are bound to  beaufort when we are in truth making for monmouth  is it not in accord  with the usages of war and the customs of great commanders   all which  specious argument i made no attempt to answer  beyond repeating that he  might avail himself of the usage  but that he must not look to me for  corroboration  on the other hand  i promised to hold my speech and to  say nothing which might hamper him  with which pledge he was forced to  be contented     and now at last  my patient listeners  i shall be able to carry you out  of the humble life of the village  and to cease my gossip of the men who  were old when i was young  and who are now lying this many a year in  the bedhampton churchyard  you shall come with me now  and you shall see  england as it was in those days  and you shall hear of how we set forth  to the wars  and of all the adventures which overtook us  and if what  i tell you should ever chance to differ from what you have read in the  book of mr  coke or of mr  oldmixon  or of any one else who has set  these matters down in print  do ye bear in mind that i am telling of  what i saw with these very eyes  and that i have helped to make history   which is a higher thing than to write it     it was  then  towards nightfall upon the twelfth day of june      that  the news reached our part of the country that monmouth had landed the  day before at lyme  a small seaport on the boundary between dorsetshire  and devonshire  a great beacon blaze upon portsdown hill was the first  news that we had of it  and then came a rattling and a drumming  from portsmouth  where the troops were assembled under arms  mounted  messengers clattered through the village street with their heads low on  their horses  necks  for the great tidings must be carried to london   that the governor of portsmouth might know how to act   note b   appendix   we were standing at our doorway in the gloaming  watching  the coming and the going  and the line of beacon fires which were  lengthening away to the eastward  when a little man galloped up to the  door and pulled his panting horse up      is joseph clarke here   he asked      i am he   said my father      are these men true   he whispered  pointing with his whip at saxon and  myself   then the trysting place is taunton  pass it on to all whom ye  know  give my horse a bait and a drink  i beg of ye  for i must get on  my way      my young brother hosea looked to the tired creature  while we brought  the rider inside and drew him a stoup of beer  a wiry  sharp faced man  he was  with a birth mark upon his temple  his face and clothes were  caked with dust  and his limbs were so stiff from the saddle that he  could scarce put one foot before another      one horse hath died under me   he said   and this can scarce last  another twenty miles  i must be in london by morning  for we hope that  danvers and wildman may be able to raise the city  yester evening i left  monmouth s camp  his blue flag floats over lyme       what force hath he   my father asked anxiously      he hath but brought over leaders  the force must come from you folk at  home  he has with him lord grey of wark  with wade  the german buyse   and eighty or a hundred more  alas  that two who came are already lost  to us  it is an evil  evil omen       what is amiss  then       dare  the goldsmith of taunton  hath been slain by fletcher of saltoun  in some child s quarrel about a horse  the peasants cried out for the  blood of the scot  and he was forced to fly aboard the ships  a sad  mishap it is  for he was a skilful leader and a veteran soldier       aye  aye   cried saxon impatiently   there will be some more skilful  leaders and veteran soldiers in the west presently to take his place   but if he knew the usages of war  how came it that he should fight upon  a private quarrel at such a time   he drew a flat brown book from  his bosom  and ran his long thin finger down the table of contents    subisectio nona    here is the very case set forth   an in hello  publico provocatus ad duellum privatae amicitiae causa declinare  possit   in which the learned fleming layeth it down that a man s  private honour must give way to the good of the cause  did it not happen  in my own case that  on the eve of the raising of the anlagerung of  vienna  we stranger officers having been invited to the tent of the  general  it chanced that a red headed irisher  one o daffy  an ancient  in the regiment of pappenheimer  did claim precedence of me on the  ground of superiority of blood  on this i drew my glove across his face   not  mark ye  in anger  but as showing that i differed in some degree  from his opinion  at which dissent he did at once offer to sustain his  contention  but i  having read this subsection to him  did make it clear  to him that we could not in honour settle the point until the turk was  chased from the city  so after the onfall        nay  sir  i may hear the narrative some future day   said the  messenger  staggering to his feet   i hope to find a relay at  chichester  and time presses  work for the cause now  or be slaves for  ever  farewell   he clambered into his saddle  and we heard the clatter  of his hoofs dying away down the london road      the time hath come for you to go  micah   said my father solemnly    nay  wife  do not weep  but rather hearten the lad on his way by a  blithe word and a merry face  i need not tell you to fight manfully  and fearlessly in this quarrel  should the tide of war set in this  direction  you may find your old father riding by your side  let us now  bow down and implore the favour of the almighty upon this expedition      we all knelt down in the low roofed  heavy raftered room while the old  man offered up an earnest  strenuous prayer for our success  even now   as i speak to ye  that group rises up before mine eyes  i see once  again your ancestor s stern  rugged face  with his brows knitted and  his corded hands writhed together in the fervour of his supplication  my  mother kneels beside him with the tears trickling down her sweet  placid  face  stifling her sobs lest the sound of them make my leave taking more  bitter  the children are in the sleeping room upstairs  and we hear the  patter of their bare feet upon the floor  the man saxon sprawls across  one of the oaken chairs  half kneeling  half reclining  with his long  legs trailing out behind  and his face buried in his hands  all round  in the flickering light of the hanging lamp i see the objects which have  been so familiar to me from childhood  the settle by the fireplace   the high back stiff elbowed chairs  the stuffed fox above the door  the  picture of christian viewing the promised land from the summit of the  delectable mountains  all small trifles in themselves  but making up  among them the marvellous thing we call home  the all powerful lodestone  which draws the wanderer s heart from the farther end of the earth   should i ever see it again save in my dreams  i  who was leaving this  sheltered cove to plunge into the heart of the storm     the prayer finished  we all rose with the exception of saxon  who  remained with his face buried in his hands for a minute or so before  starting to his feet  i shrewdly suspect that he had been fast asleep   though he explained that he had paused to offer up an additional  supplication  my father placed his hands upon my head and invoked the  blessing of heaven upon me  he then drew my companion aside  and i  heard the jingling of coin  from which i judge that he was giving him  something wherewith to start upon his travels  my mother clasped me to  her heart  and slipped a small square of paper into my hand  saying that  i was to look at it at my leisure  and that i should make her happy if  i would but conform to the instructions contained in it  this i promised  to do  and tearing myself away i set off down the darkened village  street  with my long limbed companion striding by my side     it was close upon one in the morning  and all the country folk had been  long abed  passing the wheatsheaf and the house of old solomon  i could  not but wonder what they would think of my martial garb were they afoot   i had scarce time to form the same thought before zachary palmer s  cottage when his door flew open  and the carpenter came running out with  his white hair streaming in the fresh night breeze      i have been awaiting you  micah   he cried   i had heard that monmouth  was up  and i knew that you would not lose a night ere starting  god  bless you  lad  god bless you  strong of arm and soft of heart  tender  to the weak and stern to the oppressor  you have the prayers and the  love of all who know you   i pressed his extended hands  and the last  i saw of my native hamlet was the shadowy figure of the carpenter as he  waved his good wishes to me through the darkness     we made our way across the fields to the house of whittier  the whig  farmer  where saxon got into his war harness  we found our horses ready  saddled and bridled  for my father had at the first alarm sent a message  across that we should need them  by two in the morning we were breasting  portsdown hill  armed  mounted  and fairly started on our journey to the  rebel camp       chapter viii  of our start for the wars    all along the ridge of portsdown hill we had the lights of portsmouth  and of the harbour ships twinkling beneath us on the left  while on  the right the forest of bere was ablaze with the signal fires which  proclaimed the landing of the invader  one great beacon throbbed upon  the summit of butser  while beyond that  as far as eye could reach   twinkling sparks of light showed how the tidings were being carried  north into berkshire and eastward into sussex  of these fires  some were  composed of faggots piled into heaps  and others of tar barrels set upon  poles  we passed one of these last just opposite to portchester  and the  watchers around it  hearing the tramp of our horses and the clank of  our arms  set up a loud huzza  thinking doubtless that we were king s  officers bound for the west     master decimus saxon had flung to the winds the precise demeanour which  he had assumed in the presence of my father  and rattled away with many  a jest and scrap of rhyme or song as we galloped through the darkness      gadzooks   said he frankly   it is good to be able to speak freely  without being expected to tag every sentence with a hallelujah or an  amen       you were ever the leader in those pious exercises   i remarked drily      aye  indeed  you have nicked it there  if a thing must be done  then  take a lead in it  whatever it may be  a plaguy good precept  which has  stood me in excellent stead before now  i cannot bear in mind whether i  told you how i was at one time taken prisoner by the turks and conveyed  to stamboul  there were a hundred of us or more  but the others either  perished under the bastinado  or are to this day chained to an oar in  the imperial ottoman galleys  where they are like to remain until they  die under the lash  or until some venetian or genoese bullet finds its  way into their wretched carcasses  i alone came off with my freedom       and pray  how did you make your escape   i asked      by the use of the wit wherewith providence hath endowed me   he  answered complacently   for  seeing that their accursed religion is the  blind side of these infidels  i did set myself to work upon it  to this  end i observed the fashion in which our guard performed their morning  and evening exercises  and having transformed my doublet into a praying  cloth  i did imitate them  save only that i prayed at greater length and  with more fervour       what   i cried in horror   you did pretend to be a mussulman       nay  there was no pretence  i became a mussulman  that  however   betwixt ourselves  as it might not stand me in very good stead with some  reverend aminadab fount of grace in the rebel camp  who is no admirer of  mahmoud      i was so astounded at the impudence of this confession  coming from the  mouth of one who had been leading the exercises of a pious christian  family  that i was fairly bereft of speech  decimus saxon whistled a few  bars of a sprightly tune  and then continued       my perseverance in these exercises soon led to my being singled out  from among the other prisoners  until i so prevailed upon my gaolers  that the doors were opened for me  and i was allowed out on condition  of presenting myself at the prison gates once a day  what use  think ye   did i make of my freedom       nay  you are capable of anything   said i      i set off forthwith to their chief mosque  that of st  sophia  when the  doors opened and the muezzin called  i was ever the first to hurry into  devotions and the last to leave them  did i see a mussulman strike his  head upon the pavement  i would strike mine twice  did i see him bend  and bow  i was ready to prostrate myself  in this way ere long the piety  of the converted giaour became the talk of the city  and i was provided  with a hut in which to make my sacred meditations  here i might have  done well  and indeed i had well nigh made up my mind to set up as  a prophet and write an extra chapter to the koran  when some foolish  trifle made the faithful suspicious of my honesty  it was but some  nonsense of a wench being found in my hut by some who came to consult  me upon a point of faith  but it was enough to set their heathen tongues  wagging  so i thought it wisest to give them the slip in a levantine  coaster and leave the koran uncompleted  it is perhaps as well  for it  would be a sore trial to have to give up christian women and pork  for  their garlic breathing houris and accursed kybobs of sheep s flesh      we had passed through fareham and botley during this conversation  and  were now making our way down the bishopstoke road  the soil changes  about here from chalk to sand  so that our horses  hoofs did but make  a dull subdued rattle  which was no bar to our talk  or rather to my  companion s  for i did little more than listen  in truth  my mind was so  full of anticipations of what was before us  and of thoughts of the  home behind  that i was in no humour for sprightly chatter  the sky was  somewhat clouded  but the moon glinted out between the rifts  showing  us the long road which wound away in front of us  on either side were  scattered houses with gardens sloping down toward the road  the heavy   sickly scent of strawberries was in the air      hast ever slain a man in anger   asked saxon  as we galloped along      never   i answered      ha  you will find that when you hear the clink of steel against steel   and see your foeman s eyes  you will straightway forget all rules   maxims  and precepts of the fence which your father or others may have  taught you       i have learned little of the sort   said i  my father did but teach  me to strike an honest downright blow  this sword can shear through a  square inch of iron bar       scanderbeg s sword must have scanderbeg s arm   he remarked   i  have observed that it is a fine piece of steel  one of the real old  text compellers and psalm expounders which the faithful drew in the days  of yore  when they would                prove their religion orthodox              by apostolic blows and knocks      you have not fenced much  then       scarce at all   said i      it is as well  with an old and tried swordsman like myself  knowledge  of the use of his weapon is everything  but with a young hotspur of your  temper  strength and energy go for much  i have oft remarked that those  who are most skilled at the shooting of the popinjay  the cleaving of  the turk s head  and other such sports  are ever laggards in the field   had the popinjay a crossbow as well  and an arrow on the string  or  had the turk a fist as well as a head  our young gallant s nerves would  scarce be as steady over the business  i make no doubt  master clarke   that we shall make trusty comrades  what saith old butler                never did trusty squire with knight              or knight with squire ere jump more right      i have scarce dared to quote  hudibras  for these weeks past  lest i  should set the covenant fermenting in the old man s veins       if we are indeed to be comrades   said i sternly   you must learn to  speak with more reverence and less flippancy of my father  who would  assuredly never have harboured you had he heard the tale which you have  told me even now       belike not   the adventurer answered  chuckling to himself   it is a  long stride from a mosque to a conventicle  but be not so hot headed   my friend  you lack that repose of character which will come to you   no doubt  in your more mature years  what  man  within five minutes of  seeing me you would have smitten me on the head with an oar  and ever  since you have been like a bandog at my heels  ready to hark if i do but  set my foot over what you regard as the straight line  remember that you  go now among men who fight on small occasion of quarrel  a word awry may  mean a rapier thrust       do you bear the same in mind   i answered hotly   my temper is  peaceful  but covert threats and veiled menace i shall not abide       odd s mercy   he cried   i see that you will start carving me anon  and  take me to monmouth s camp in sections  nay  nay  we shall have fighting  enow without falling out among ourselves  what houses are those on the  left       the village of swathling   i replied   the lights of bishopstoke lie to  the right  in the hollow       then we are fifteen miles on our way  and methinks there is already  some faint flush of dawn in the east  hullo  what have we here  beds  must be scarce if folks sleep on the highways      a dark blur which i had remarked upon the roadway in front of us had  resolved itself as we approached into the figure of a man  stretched  at full length  with his face downwards  and his head resting upon his  crossed arms      some reveler  mayhap  from the village inn   i remarked      there s blood in the air   said saxon  raising up his beak like nose  like a vulture which scents carrion   methinks he sleeps the sleep which  knows no waking      he sprang down from his saddle  and turned the figure over upon his  back  the cold pale light of the early dawn shimmering upon his staring  eyes and colourless face showed that the old soldier s instinct was  correct  and that he had indeed drawn his last breath      here s a pretty piece of work   said saxon  kneeling by the dead man s  side and passing his hands over his pockets   footpads  doubtless  not a  stiver in his pockets  nor as much as a sleeve link to help pay for the  burial       how was he slain   i asked in horror  looking down at the poor vacant  face  the empty house from which the tenant had departed      a stab from behind and a tap on the head from the butt of a pistol   he cannot have been dead long  and yet every groat is gone  a man of  position  too  i should judge from his dress  broadcloth coat by the  feel  satin breeches  and silver buckles on his shoes  the rogues must  have had some plunder with him  could we but run across them  clarke  it  would be a great and grand thing       it would indeed   said i heartily   what greater privilege than to  execute justice upon such cowardly murderers       pooh  pooh   he cried   justice is a slippery dame  and hath a  two edged sword in her hand  we may have enough of justice in our  character as rebels to give us a surfeit of it  i would fain overtake  these robbers that we may relieve them of their  spolia opima   together  with any other wealth which they may have unlawfully amassed  my learned  friend the fleming layeth it down that it is no robbery to rob a robber   but where shall we conceal this body       wherefore should we conceal it   i asked      why  man  unused to war or the precautions of a warrior  you must yet  see that should this body be found here  there will be a hue and cry  through the country  and that strangers like ourselves will be arrested  on suspicion  should we clear ourselves  which is no very easy matter   the justice will at least want to know whence we come and whither we  go  which may lead to inquiries that may bode us little good  i shall  therefore take the liberty  mine unknown and silent friend  of dragging  you into yon bushes  where for a day or two at least you are like to lie  unobserved  and so bring no harm upon honest men       for god s sake do not treat it so unkindly   i cried  springing down  from my horse and laying my hand upon my companion s arm   there is no  need to trail it in so unseemly a fashion  if it must be moved hence  i  shall carry it with all due reverence   so saying  i picked the body up  in my arms  and bearing it to a wayside clump of yellow gorse bushes  i  laid it solemnly down and drew the branches over it to conceal it      you have the thews of an ox and the heart of a woman   muttered my  companion   by the mass  that old white headed psalm singer was right   for if my memory serves me  he said words to that effect  a few handfuls  of dust will hide the stains  now we may jog upon our way without any  fear of being called upon to answer for another man s sins  let me but  get my girth tightened and we may soon be out of danger s way       i have had to do   said saxon  as we rode onwards   with many gentry  of this sort  with albanian brigands  the banditti of piedmont  the  lanzknechte and freiritter of the rhine  algerine picaroons  and other  such folk  yet i cannot call to mind one who hath ever been able to  retire in his old age on a sufficient competence  it is but a precarious  trade  and must end sooner or later in a dance on nothing in a tight  cravat  with some kind friend tugging at your legs to ease you of any  breath that you might have left       nor does that end all   i remarked      no  there is tophet behind and the flames of hell  so our good friends  the parsons tell us  well  if a man is to make no money in this world   be hanged at the end of it  and finally burn for ever  he hath assuredly  wandered on to a thorny track  if  on the other hand  one could always  lay one s hands on a well lined purse  as those rogues have done  to night  one might be content to risk something in the world to come       but what can the well filled purse do for them   said i   what will  the few score pieces which these bloodthirsty wretches have filched from  this poor creature avail them when their own hour of death comes round       true   said saxon dryly   they may  however  prove useful in the  meantime  this you say is bishopstoke  what are the lights over yonder       they come  i think  from bishop s waltham   i answered      we must press on  for i would fain be in salisbury before it is broad  day  there we shall put our horses up until evening and have some rest   for there is nothing gained by man or beast coming jaded to the wars   all this day the western roads will be crowded with couriers  and mayhap  patrolled by cavalry as well  so that we cannot show our faces upon it  without a risk of being stopped and examined  now if we lie by all day   and push on at dusk  keeping off the main road and making our way across  salisbury plain and the somersetshire downs  we shall be less likely to  come to harm       but what if monmouth be engaged before we come up to him   i asked      then we shall have missed a chance of getting our throats cut  why   man  supposing that he has been routed and entirely dispersed  would  it not be a merry conceit for us to appear upon the scene as two loyal  yeomen  who had ridden all the way from hampshire to strike in against  the king s enemies  we might chance to get some reward in money or in  land for our zeal  nay  frown not  for i was but jesting  breathe our  horses by walking them up this hill  my jennet is as fresh as when we  started  but those great limbs of thine are telling upon the grey      the patch of light in the east had increased and broadened  and the sky  was mottled with little pink feathers of cloud  as we passed over  the low hills by chandler s ford and romsey we could see the smoke of  southampton to the south east  and the broad dark expanse of the new  forest with the haze of morning hanging over it  a few horsemen passed  us  pricking along  too much engrossed in their own errand to inquire  ours  a couple of carts and a long string of pack horses  laden  principally with bales of wool  came straggling along a byroad  and  the drivers waved their broad hats to us and wished us god speed  at  dunbridge the folk were just stirring  and paused in taking down the  cottage shutters to come to the garden railings and watch us pass  as we  entered dean  the great red sun pushed its rosy rim over the edge of the  horizon  and the air was filled with the buzz of insects and the sweet  scent of the morning  we dismounted at this latter village  and had a  cup of ale while resting and watering the horses  the landlord could  tell us nothing about the insurgents  and indeed seemed to care very  little about the matter one way or the other   as long as brandy pays a  duty of six shillings and eightpence a gallon  and freight and leakage  comes to half a crown  while i am expected to sell it at twelve  shillings  it matters little to me who is king of england  give me a  king that will prevent the hop blight and i am his man   those were the  landlord s politics  and i dare say a good many more were of his way of  thinking     from dean to salisbury is all straight road with moor  morass  and  fenland on either side  broken only by the single hamlet of aldersbury   just over the wiltshire border  our horses  refreshed by the short rest   stepped out gallantly  and the brisk motion  with the sunlight and the  beauty of the morning  combined to raise our spirits and cheer us after  the depression of the long ride through the darkness  and the incident  of the murdered traveller  wild duck  widgeon  and snipe flapped up from  either side of the road at the sound of the horses  hoofs  and once a  herd of red deer sprang to their feet from among the ferns and scampered  away in the direction of the forest  once  too  when passing a dense  clump of trees  we saw a shadowy white creature half hidden by the  trunks  which must  i fancy  have been one of those wild cattle of  which i have heard the peasants speak  who dwell in the recesses of  the southern woods  and are so fierce and intractable that none dare  approach them  the breadth of the view  the keenness of the air  and the  novelty of the sense of having great work to do  all combined to send a  flush of life through my veins such as the quiet village existence  had never been able to give  my more experienced companion felt the  influence too  for he lifted up a cracked voice and broke into a droning  chant  which he assured me was an eastern ode which had been taught him  by the second sister of the hospodar of wallachia      anent monmouth   he remarked  coming back suddenly to the realities of  our position   it is unlikely that he can take the field for some days   though much depends upon his striking a blow soon  and so raising the  courage of his followers before the king s troops can come down upon  him  he has  mark ye  not only his troops to find  but their weapons   which is like to prove a more difficult matter  suppose he can raise  five thousand men  and he cannot stir with less  he will not have one  musket in five  so the rest must do as they can with pikes and bills  or  such other rude arms as they can find  all this takes time  and though  there may be skirmishes  there can scarce be any engagement of import  before we arrive       he will have been landed three or four days ere we reach him   said i      hardly time for him with his small staff of officers to enrol his men  and divide them into regiments  i scarce expect to find him at taunton   though we were so directed  hast ever heard whether there are any rich  papists in those parts       i know not   i replied      if so there might be plate chests and silver chargers  to say nothing  of my lady s jewels and other such trifles to reward a faithful soldier   what would war be without plunder  a bottle without the wine  a shell  without the oyster  see the house yonder that peeps through the trees   i warrant there is a store of all good things under that roof  which you  and i might have for the asking  did we but ask with our swords in our  grip  you are my witness that your father did give and not lend me this  horse       why say you that  then       lest he claim a half of whatever booty i may chance to gain  what saith  my learned fleming under the heading  an qui militi equum praebuit   praedae ab eo captae particeps esse debeat   which signifieth  whether  he who lendeth a horse hath a claim on the plunder of him who borroweth  it   in this discourse he cites a case wherein a spanish commander  having lent a steed to one of his captains  and the said captain having  captured the general of the enemy  the commander did sue him for a  half share of the twenty thousand crowns which formed the ransom of the  prisoner  a like case is noted by the famous petrinus bellus in his book   de re militari   much read by leaders of repute    note c  appendix       i can promise you   i answered   that no such claim shall ever be made  by my father upon you  see yonder  over the brow of the hill  how the  sun shines upon the high cathedral tower  which points upwards with its  great stone finger to the road that every man must travel       there is good store of silver and plate in these same churches   quoth  my companion   i remember that at leipsic  when i was serving my first  campaign  i got a candlestick  which i was forced to sell to a jew  broker for a fourth of its value  yet even at his price it sufficed to  fill my haversack with broad pieces      it chanced that saxon s mare had gained a stride or two upon mine whilst  he spoke  so that i was able to get a good view of him without turning  my head  i had scarce had light during our ride to see how his harness  sat upon him  but now i was amazed on looking at him to mark the change  which it had wrought in the man  in his civil dress his lankiness and  length of limb gave him an awkward appearance  but on horse back  with  his lean  gaunt face looking out from his steel cap  his breastplate  and buff jacket filling out his figure  and his high boots of untanned  leather reaching to the centre of his thighs  he looked the veteran  man at arms which he purported to be  the ease with which he sat his  horse  the high  bold expression upon his face  and the great length of  his arms  all marked him as one who could give a good account of himself  in a fray  in his words alone i could have placed little trust  but  there was that in his bearing which assured even a novice like myself  that he was indeed a trained man of war      that is the avon which glitters amongst the trees   i remarked   we are  about three miles from salisbury town       it is a noble spire   said he  glancing at the great stone spire in  front of us   the men of old would seem to have spent all their days in  piling stones upon stones  and yet we read of tough battles and shrewd  blows struck  showing that they had some time for soldierly relaxation   and were not always at this mason work       the church was rich in those days   i answered  shaking my bridle  for  covenant was beginning to show signs of laziness   but here comes one  who might perhaps tell us something of the war      a horseman who bore traces of having ridden long and hard was rapidly  approaching us  both rider and steed were grey with dust and splashed  with mire  yet he galloped with loosened rein and bent body  as one to  whom every extra stride is of value      what ho  friend   cried saxon  reining his mare across the road so as  to bar the man s passage   what news from the west       i must not tarry   the messenger gasped  slackening his speed for an  instant   i bear papers of import from gregory alford  mayor of lyme  to  ins majesty s council  the rebels make great head  and gather together  like bees in the swarming time  there are some thousands in arms  already  and all devonshire is on the move  the rebel horse under lord  grey hath been beaten back from bridport by the red militia of dorset   but every prickeared whig from the channel to the severn is making his  way to monmouth   with this brief summary of the news he pushed his way  past us and clattered on in a cloud of dust upon his mission      the broth is fairly on the fire  then   quoth decimus saxon  as we rode  onwards   now that skins have been slit the rebels may draw their swords  and fling away their scabbards  for it s either victory for them or  their quarters will be dangling in every market town of the county  heh   lad  we throw a main for a brave stake       marked ye that lord grey had met with a check   said i      pshaw  it is of no import  a cavalry skirmish at the most  for it is  impossible that monmouth could have brought his main forces to bridport   nor would he if he could  for it is out of his track  it was one of  those three shots and a gallop affrays  where each side runs away and  each claims the victory  but here we are in the streets of salisbury   now leave the talking to me  or your wrong headed truthfulness may lay  us by the heels before our time      passing down the broad high street we dismounted in front of the blue  boar inn  and handed our tired horses over to the ostler  to whom  saxon  in a loud voice  and with many rough military oaths  gave strict  injunctions as to their treatment  he then clanked into the inn parlour   and throwing himself into one chair with his feet upon another  he  summoned the landlord up before him  and explained our needs in a tone  and manner which should give him a due sense of our quality      of your best  and at once   quoth he   have your largest double couched  chamber ready with your softest lavender scented sheets  for we have had  a weary ride and must rest  and hark ye  landlord  no palming off your  stale  musty goods as fresh  or of your washy french wines for the true  hainault vintage  i would have you to understand that my friend here and  i are men who meet with some consideration in the world  though we  care not to speak our names to every underling  deserve well of us   therefore  or it may be the worse for you      this speech  combined with my companion s haughty manner and fierce  face  had such an effect upon the landlord that he straightway sent  us in the breakfast which had been prepared for three officers of the  blues  who were waiting for it in the next apartment  this kept them  fasting for another half hour  and we could hear their oaths and  complaints through the partition while we were devouring their capon and  venison pie  having eaten a hearty meal and washed it down with a bottle  of burgundy we sought our room  and throwing our tired limbs upon the  bed  were soon in a deep slumber         chapter ix  of a passage of arms at the blue boar    i had slept several hours when i was suddenly aroused by a prodigious  crash  followed by the clash of arms and shrill cries from the lower  floor  springing to my feet i found that the bed upon which my comrade  had lain was vacant  and that the door of the apartment was opened  as  the uproar still continued  and as i seemed to discern his voice in the  midst of it  i caught up my sword  and without waiting to put on either  head piece  steel breast  or arm plates  i hurried to the scene of the  commotion     the hall and passage were filled with silly maids and staring drawers   attracted  like myself  by the uproar  through these i pushed my way  into the apartment where we had breakfasted in the morning  which was  a scene of the wildest disorder  the round table in the centre had  been tilted over upon its side  and three broken bottles of wine  with  apples  pears  nuts  and the fragments of the dishes containing them   were littered over the floor  a couple of packs of cards and a dice box  lay amongst the scattered feast  close by the door stood decimus saxon   with his drawn rapier in his hand and a second one beneath his feet   while facing him there was a young officer in a blue uniform  whose face  was reddened with shame and anger  and who looked wildly about the room  as though in search of some weapon to replace that of which he had been  deprived  he might have served cibber or gibbons as a model for a statue  of impotent rage  two other officers dressed in the same blue uniform  stood by their comrade  and as i observed that they had laid their hands  upon the hilts of their swords  i took my place by saxon s side  and  stood ready to strike in should the occasion arise      what would the maitre d armes say  the maitre d escrime   cried my  companion   methinks he should lose his place for not teaching you to  make a better show  out on him  is this the way that he teaches the  officers of his majesty s guard to use their weapons       this raillery  sir   said the elder of the three  a squat  brown   heavy faced man   is not undeserved  and yet might perchance be  dispensed with  i am free to say that our friend attacked you somewhat  hastily  and that a little more deference should have been shown by so  young a soldier to a cavalier of your experience      the other officer  who was a fine looking  noble featured man  expressed  himself in much the same manner   if this apology will serve   said he    i am prepared to join in it  if  however  more is required  i shall be  happy to take the quarrel upon myself       nay  nay  take your bradawl   saxon answered good humouredly  kicking  the sword towards his youthful opponent   but  mark you  when you would  lunge  direct your point upwards rather than down  for otherwise you  must throw your wrist open to your antagonist  who can scarce fail to  disarm you  in quarte  tierce  or saccoon the same holds good      the youth sheathed his sword  but was so overcome by his own easy defeat  and the contemptuous way in which his opponent had dismissed him  that  he turned and hurried out of the room  meanwhile decimus saxon and the  two officers set to work getting the table upon its legs and restoring  the room to some sort of order  in which i did what i could to assist  them      i held three queens for the first time to day   grumbled the soldier of  fortune   i was about to declare them when this young bantam flew at my  throat  he hath likewise been the cause of our losing three flasks of  most excellent muscadine  when he hath drunk as much bad wine as i have  been forced to do  he will not be so hasty in wasting the good       he is a hot headed youngster   the older officer replied   and a little  solitary reflection added to the lesson which you have taught him may  bring him profit  as for the muscadine  that loss will soon be repaired   the more gladly as your friend here will help us to drink it       i was roused by the crash of weapons   said i   and i scarce know now  what has occurred       why  a mere tavern brawl  which your friend s skill and judgment  prevented from becoming serious  i prythee take the rush bottomed chair   and do you  jack  order the wine  if our comrade hath spilled the last  it is for us to furnish this  and the best the cellars contain  we have  been having a hand at basset  which mr  saxon here playeth as skilfully  as he wields the small sword  it chanced that the luck ran against young  horsford  which doubtless made him prone to be quick in taking offence   your friend in conversation  when discoursing of his experiences in  foreign countries  remarked that the french household troops were to  his mind brought to a higher state of discipline than any of our own  regiments  on which horsford fired up  and after a hot word or two they  found themselves  as you have seen  at drawn bilbo  the boy hath seen no  service  and is therefore over eager to give proof of his valour       wherein   said the tall officer   he showed a want of thought towards  me  for had the words been offensive it was for me  who am a senior  captain and brevet major  to take it up  and not for a slip of a cornet   who scarce knows enough to put his troop through the exercise       you say right  ogilvy   said the other  resuming his seat by the table  and wiping the cards which had been splashed by the wine   had the  comparison been made by an officer of louis s guard for the purpose  of contumely and braggadocio  it would then indeed have become us to  venture a passado  but when spoken by an englishman of ripe experience  it becomes a matter of instructive criticism  which should profit rather  than annoy       true  ambrose   the other answered   without such criticism a force  would become stagnant  and could never hope to keep level with those  continental armies  which are ever striving amongst themselves for  increased efficacy      so pleased was i at these sensible remarks on the part of the strangers   that i was right glad to have the opportunity of making their closer  acquaintance over a flask of excellent wine  my father s prejudices  had led me to believe that a king s officer was ever a compound of the  coxcomb and the bully  but i found on testing it that this idea  like  most others which a man takes upon trust  had very little foundation  upon truth  as a matter of fact  had they been dressed in less warlike  garb and deprived of their swords and jack boots  they would have passed  as particularly mild mannered men  for their conversation ran in the  learned channels  and they discussed boyle s researches in chemistry and  the ponderation of air with much gravity and show of knowledge  at  the same time  their brisk bearing and manly carriage showed that in  cultivating the scholar they hail not sacrificed the soldier      may i ask  sir   said one of them  addressing saxon   whether in  your wide experiences you have ever met with any of those sages and  philosophers who have conferred such honour and fame upon france and  germany      my companion looked ill at ease  as one who feels that he has been taken  off his ground   there was indeed one such at nurnberg   he answered    one gervinus or gervanus  who  the folk said  could turn an ingot of  iron into an ingot of gold as easily as i turn this tobacco into ashes   old pappenheimer shut him up with a ton of metal  and threatened to put  the thumbikins upon him unless he changed it into gold pieces  i can  vouch for it that there was not a yellow boy there  for i was captain of  the guard and searched the whole dungeon through  to my sorrow i say it   for i had myself added a small iron brazier to the heap  thinking that  if there should be any such change it would be as well that i should  have some small share in the experiment       alchemy  transmutation of metals  and the like have been set aside by  true science   remarked the taller officer   even old sir thomas browne  of norwich  who is ever ready to plead the cause of the ancients  can  find nothing to say in favour of it  from trismegistus downwards through  albertus magnus  aquinas  raymond lullius  basil valentine  paracelsus   and the rest  there is not one who has left more than a cloud of words  behind him       nor did the rogue i mention   said saxon   there was another   van helstatt  who was a man of learning  and cast horoscopes in  consideration of some small fee or honorarium  i have never met so wise  a man  for he would talk of the planets and constellations as though he  kept them all in his own backyard  he made no more of a comet than if it  were a mouldy china orange  and he explained their nature to us  saying  that they were but common stars which had had a hole knocked in them  so  that their insides or viscera protruded  he was indeed a philosopher       and did you ever put his skill to the test   asked one of the officers   with a smile      not i  forsooth  for i have ever kept myself clear of black magic or  diablerie of the sort  my comrade pierce scotton  who was an oberst  in the imperial cavalry brigade  did pay him a rose noble to have his  future expounded  if i remember aright  the stars said that he was  over fond of wine and women  he had a wicked eye and a nose like a  carbuncle   they foretold also that he would attain a marshal s baton  and die at a ripe age  which might well have come true had he not been  unhorsed a month later at ober graustock  and slain by the hoofs of his  own troop  neither the planets nor even the experienced farrier of  the regiment could have told that the brute would have foundered so  completely      the officers laughed heartily at my companion s views  and rose from  their chairs  for the bottle was empty and the evening beginning to  draw in   we have work to do here   said the one addressed as ogilvy    besides  we must find this foolish boy of ours  and tell him that it is  no disgrace to be disarmed by so expert a swordsman  we have to prepare  the quarters for the regiment  who will be up to join churchill s  forces not later than to night  ye are yourselves bound for the west  i  understand       we belong to the duke of beaufort s household   said saxon      indeed  i thought ye might belong to portman s yellow regiment of  militia  i trust that the duke will muster every man he can  and make  play until the royal forces come up       how many will churchill bring   asked my companion carelessly      eight hundred horse at the most  but my lord feversham will follow  after with close on four thousand foot       we may meet on the field of battle  if not before   said i  and we bade  our friendly enemies a very cordial adieu      a skilful equivoque that last of yours  master micah   quoth decimus  saxon   though smacking of double dealing in a truth lover like  yourself  if we meet them in battle i trust that it may be with  chevaux de frise of pikes and morgenstierns before us  and a litter of  caltrops in front of them  for monmouth has no cavalry that could stand  for a moment against the royal guards       how came you to make their acquaintance   i asked      i slept a few hours  but i have learned in camps to do with little  rest  finding you in sound slumber  and hearing the rattle of the  dice box below  i came softly down and found means to join their  party  whereby i am a richer man by fifteen guineas  and might have  had more had that young fool not lugged out at me  or had the talk not  turned afterwards upon such unseemly subjects as the laws of chemistry  and the like  prythee  what have the horse guards blue to do with the  laws of chemistry  wessenburg of the pandours would  even at his own  mess table  suffer much free talk  more perhaps than fits in with the  dignity of a leader  had his officers ventured upon such matter as  this  however  there would have been a drum head court martial  or a  cashiering at the least      without stopping to dispute either master saxon s judgment or that of  wessenburg of the pandours  i proposed that we should order an evening  meal  and should employ the remaining hour or two of daylight in looking  over the city  the principal sight is of course the noble cathedral   which is built in such exact proportion that one would fail to  understand its great size did one not actually enter it and pace round  the long dim aisles  so solemn were its sweeping arches and the long  shafts of coloured light which shone through the stained glass windows   throwing strange shadows amongst the pillars  that even my companion   albeit not readily impressed  was silent and subdued  it was a great  prayer in stone     on our way back to the inn we passed the town lock up  with a railed  space in front of it  in which three great black muzzled bloodhounds  were stalking about  with fierce crimsoned eyes and red tongues lolling  out of their mouths  they were used  a bystander told us  for the  hunting down of criminals upon salisbury plain  which had been a refuge  for rogues and thieves  until this means had been adopted for following  them to their hiding places  it was well nigh dark before we returned to  the hostel  and entirely so by the time that we had eaten our suppers   paid our reckoning  and got ready for the road     before we set off i bethought me of the paper which my mother had  slipped into my hand on parting  and drawing it from my pouch i read  it by the rushlight in our chamber  it still bore the splotches of the  tears which she had dropped on it  poor soul  and ran in this wise        instructions from mistress mary clarke to her son micah  on the twelfth  day of june in the year of our lord sixteen hundred and eighty five      on occasion of his going forth  like david of old  to do battle  with the goliath of papistry  which hath overshadowed and thrown into  disrepute that true and reverent regard for ritual which should exist in  the real church of england  as ordained by law      let these points be observed by him  namely  to wit         change your hosen when the occasion serves  you have two pairs in  your saddle bag  and can buy more  for the wool work is good in the  west         a hare s foot suspended round the neck driveth away colic         say the lord s prayer night and morning  also read the scriptures   especially job  the psalms  and the gospel according to st  matthew         daffy s elixir possesses extraordinary powers in purifying the blood  and working off all phlegms  humours  vapours  or rheums  the dose is  five drops  a small phial of it will be found in the barrel of your left  pistol  with wadding around it lest it come to harm         ten golden pieces are sewn into the hem of your under doublet  touch  them not  save as a last resource         fight stoutly for the lord  and yet i pray you  micah  be not too  forward in battle  but let others do their turn also     press not into the heart of the fray  and yet flinch not from the  standard of the protestant faith      and oh  micah  my own bright boy  come back safe to your mother  or my  very heart will break      and the deponent will ever pray        the sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears  spring to my eyes  and yet i could scarce forbear from smiling at the  whole composition  for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the  graces of style  and it was evidently her thought that in order to make  her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of  legal form  i had little time to think over her advice  however  for i  had scarce finished reading it before the voice of decimus saxon  and  the clink of the horses  hoofs upon the cobble stones of the yard   informed me that all was ready for our departure           chapter x  of our perilous adventure on the plain    we were not half a mile from the town before the roll of kettledrums and  the blare of bugles swelling up musically through the darkness announced  the arrival of the regiment of horse which our friends at the inn had  been expecting      it is as well  perhaps   said saxon   that we gave them the slip   for that young springald might have smelled a rat and played us some  ill turn  have you chanced to see my silken kerchief       not i   i answered      nay  then  it must have fallen from my bosom during our ruffle  i  can ill afford to leave it  for i travel light in such matters  eight  hundred men  quoth the major  and three thousand to follow  should i  meet this same oglethorpe or ogilvy when the little business is over   i shall read him a lesson on thinking less of chemistry and more of  the need of preserving military precautions  it is well always to be  courteous to strangers and to give them information  but it is well also  that the information should be false       as his may have been   i suggested      nay  nay  the words came too glibly from his tongue  so ho  chloe  so  ho  she is full of oats and would fain gallop  but it is so plaguy dark  that we can scarce see where we are going      we had been trotting down the broad high road shimmering vaguely white  in the gloom  with the shadowy trees dancing past us on either side   scarce outlined against the dark background of cloud  we were now coming  upon the eastern edge of the great plain  which extends forty miles one  way and twenty the other  over the greater part of wiltshire and past  the boundaries of somersetshire  the main road to the west skirts this  wilderness  but we had agreed to follow a less important track   which would lead us to our goal  though in a more tedious manner  its  insignificance would  we hoped  prevent it from being guarded by the  king s horse  we had come to the point where this byroad branches off  from the main highway when we heard the clatter of horses  hoofs behind  us      here comes some one who is not afraid to gallop   i remarked      halt here in the shadow   cried saxon  in a short  quick whisper   have  your blade loose in the scabbard  he must have a set errand who rides so  fast o  nights      looking down the road we could make out through the darkness a shadowy  blur which soon resolved itself into man and horse  the rider was  well nigh abreast of us before he was aware of our presence  when he  pulled up his steed in a strange  awkward fashion  and faced round in  our direction      is micah clarke there   he said  in a voice which was strangely  familiar to my ears      i am micah clarke   said i      and i am reuben lockarby   cried our pursuer  in a mock heroic voice    ah  micah lad  i d embrace you were it not that i should assuredly fall  out of the saddle if i attempted it  and perchance drag you along  that  sudden pull up well nigh landed me on the roadway  i have been sliding  off and clambering on ever since i bade goodbye to havant  sure  such a  horse for slipping from under one was never bestridden by man       good heavens  reuben   i cried in amazement   what brings you all this  way from home       the very same cause which brings you  micah  and also don decimo saxon   late of the solent  whom methinks i see in the shadow behind you  how  fares it  oh illustrious one       it is you  then  young cock of the woods   growled saxon  in no very  overjoyed voice      no less a person   said reuben   and now  my gay cavalieros  round with  your horses and trot on your way  for there is no time to be lost  we  ought all to be at taunton to morrow       but  my dear reuben   said i   it cannot be that you are coming with us  to join monmouth  what would your father say  this is no holiday jaunt   but one that may have a sad and stern ending  at the best  victory can  only come through much bloodshed and danger  at the worst  we are as  like to wind up upon a scaffold as not       forwards  lads  forwards   cried he  spurring on his horse   it is all  arranged and settled  i am about to offer my august person  together  with a sword which i borrowed and a horse which i stole  to his most  protestant highness  james  duke of monmouth       but how comes it all   i asked  as we rode on together   it warms my  very heart to see you  but you were never concerned either in religion  or in politics  whence  then  this sudden resolution       well  truth to tell   he replied   i am neither a king s man nor a  duke s man  nor would i give a button which sat upon the throne  i do  not suppose that either one or the other would increase the custom of  the wheatsheaf  or want reuben lockarby for a councillor  i am a micah  clarke man  though  from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet   and if he rides to the wars  may the plague strike me if i don t stick  to his elbow   he raised his hand excitedly as he spoke  and instantly  losing his balance  he shot into a dense clump of bushes by the roadside  whence his legs flapped helplessly in the darkness      that makes the tenth   said he  scrambling out and clambering into  his saddle once more   my father used to tell me not to sit a horse too  closely   a gentle rise and fall   said the old man  egad  there is more  fall than rise  and it is anything but gentle       odd s truth   exclaimed saxon   how in the name of all the saints in  the calendar do you expect to keep your seat in the presence of an enemy  if you lose it on a peaceful high road       i can but try  my illustrious   he answered  rearranging his ruffled  clothing   perchance the sudden and unexpected character of my movements  may disconcert the said enemy       well  well  there may be more truth in that than you are aware of    quoth saxon  riding upon lockarby s bridle arm  so that there was scarce  room for him to fall between us   i had sooner fight a man like that  young fool at the inn  who knew a little of the use of his weapon  than  one like micah here  or yourself  who know nothing  you can tell what  the one is after  but the other will invent a system of his own which  will serve his turn for the nonce  ober hauptmann muller was reckoned to  be the finest player at the small sword in the kaiser s army  and could  for a wager snick any button from an opponent s vest without cutting the  cloth  yet was he slain in an encounter with fahnfuhrer zollner  who was  a cornet in our own pandour corps  and who knew as much of the rapier as  you do of horsemanship  for the rapier  be it understood  is designed  to thrust and not to cut  so that no man wielding it ever thinks of  guarding a side stroke  but zollner  being a long armed man  smote his  antagonist across the face with his weapon as though it had been a  cane  and then  ere he had time to recover himself  fairly pinked him   doubtless if the matter were to do again  the oberhauptmann would have  got his thrust in sooner  but as it was  no explanation or excuse could  get over the fact that the man was dead       if want of knowledge maketh a dangerous swordsman   quoth reuben   then  am i even more deadly than the unpronounceable gentleman whom you have  mentioned  to continue my story  however  which i broke off in order to  step down from my horse  i found out early in the morning that ye were  gone  and zachary palmer was able to tell me whither  i made up my mind   therefore  that i would out into the world also  to this end i borrowed  a sword from solomon sprent  and my father having gone to gosport   i helped myself to the best nag in his stables  for i have too much  respect for the old man to allow one of his flesh and blood to go  ill provided to the wars  all day i have ridden  since early morning   being twice stopped on suspicion of being ill affected  but having the  good luck to get away each time  i knew that i was close at your heels   for i found them searching for you at the salisbury inn      decimus whistled   searching for us   said he      yes  it seems that they had some notion that ye were not what ye  professed to be  so the inn was surrounded as i passed  but none knew  which road ye had taken       said i not so   cried saxon   that young viper hath stirred up the  regiment against us  we must push on  for they may send a party on our  track       we are off the main road now   i remarked   even should they pursue us   they would be unlikely to follow this side track       yet it would be wise to show them a clean pair of heels   said saxon   spurring his mare into a gallop  lockarby and i followed his example   and we all three rode swiftly along the rough moorland track     we passed through scattered belts of pinewood  where the wild cat howled  and the owl screeched  and across broad stretches of fenland and moor   where the silence was only broken by the booming cry of the bittern or  the fluttering of wild duck far above our heads  the road was in parts  overgrown with brambles  and was so deeply rutted and so studded with  sharp and dangerous hollows  that our horses came more than once upon  their knees  in one place the wooden bridge which led over a stream had  broken down  and no attempt had been made to repair it  so that we were  compelled to ride our horses girth deep through the torrent  at first  some scattered lights had shown that we were in the neighbourhood of  human habitations  but these became fewer as we advanced  until the last  died away and we found ourselves upon the desolate moor which stretched  away in unbroken solitude to the shadowy horizon  the moon had broken  through the clouds and now shone hazily through wreaths of mist   throwing a dim light over the wild scene  and enabling us to keep to  the track  which was not fenced in in any way and could scarce be  distinguished from the plain around it     we had slackened our pace under the impression that all fear of pursuit  was at an end  and reuben was amazing us by an account of the excitement  which had been caused in havant by our disappearance  when through the  stillness of the night a dull  muffled rat tat tat struck upon my ear   at the same moment saxon sprang from his horse and listened intently  with sidelong head      boot and saddle   he cried  springing into his seat again   they are  after us as sure as fate  a dozen troopers by the sound  we must shake  them off  or goodbye to monmouth       give them their heads   i answered  and striking spurs into our steeds   we thundered on through the darkness  covenant and chloe were as fresh  as could be wished  and soon settled down into a long springy gallop   our friend s horse however  had been travelling all day  and its  long drawn  laboured breathing showed that it could not hold out for  long  through the clatter of our horses  hoofs i could still from time  to time hear the ominous murmur from behind us      this will never do  reuben   said i anxiously  as the weary creature  stumbled  and the rider came perilously near to shooting over its head      the old horse is nearly foundered   he answered ruefully   we are off  the road now  and the rough ground is too much for her       yes  we are off the track   cried saxon over his shoulder  for he led  us by a few paces   bear in mind that the bluecoats have been on the  march all day  so that their horses may also be blown  how in himmel  came they to know which road we took      as if in answer to his ejaculation  there rose out of the still night  behind us a single  clear  bell like note  swelling and increasing in  volume until it seemed to fill the whole air with its harmony      a bloodhound   cried saxon     a second sharper  keener note  ending in an unmistakable howl  answered  the first      another of them   said he   they have loosed the brutes that we saw  near the cathedral  gad  we little thought when we peered over the rails  at them  a few hours ago  that they would so soon be on our own track   keep a firm knee and a steady seat  for a slip now would be your last       holy mother   cried reuben   i had steeled myself to die in battle  but  to be dogsmeat  it is something outside the contract       they hold them in leash   said saxon  between his teeth   else they  would outstrip the horses and be lost in the darkness     could we but come on running water we might put them off our track       my horse cannot hold on at this pace for more than a very few minutes    reuben cried   if i break down  do ye go on  for ye must remember  that they are upon your track and not mine  they have found cause for  suspicion of the two strangers of the inn  but none of me       nay  reuben  we shall stand or fall together   said i sadly  for at  every step his horse grew more and more feeble   in this darkness they  will make little distinction between persons       keep a good heart   shouted the old soldier  who was now leading us by  twenty yards or more   we can hear them because the wind blows from that  way  but it s odds whether they have heard us  methinks they slacken in  their pursuit       the sound of their horses has indeed grown fainter   said i joyfully      so faint that i can hear it no longer   my companion cried     we reined up our panting steeds and strained our ears  but not a  sound could we hear save the gentle murmur of the breeze amongst the  whin bushes  and the melancholy cry of the night jar  behind us the  broad rolling plain  half light and half shadow  stretched away to  the dim horizon without sign of life or movement   we have either  outstripped them completely  or else they have given up the chase   said  i   what ails the horses that they should tremble and snort       my poor beast is nearly done for   reuben remarked  leaning forward and  passing his hand down the creature s reeking neck      for all that we cannot rest   said saxon   we may not be out of danger  yet  another mile or two may shake us clear  but i like it not       like not what       these horses and their terrors  the beasts can at times both see and  hear more than we  as i could show by divers examples drawn from mine  own experience on the danube and in the palatinate  were the time and  place more fitting  let us on  then  before we rest      the weary horses responded bravely to the call  and struggled onwards  over the broken ground for a considerable time  at last we were thinking  of pulling up in good earnest  and of congratulating ourselves upon  having tired out our pursuers  when of a sudden the bell like baying  broke upon our ears far louder than it had been before  so loud  indeed   that it was evident that the dogs were close upon our heels      the accursed hounds   cried saxon  putting spurs to his horse and  shooting ahead of us   i feared as much  they have freed them from the  leash  there is no escape from the devils  but we can choose the spot  where we shall make our stand       come on  reuben   i shouted   we have only to reckon with the dogs now   their masters have let them loose  and turned back for salisbury       pray heaven they break their necks before they get there   he cried    they set dogs on us as though we were rats in a cock pit  yet they call  england a christian country  it s no use  micah  poor dido can t stir  another step      as he spoke  the sharp fierce bay of the hounds rose again  clear and  stern on the night air  swelling up from a low hoarse growl to a high  angry yelp  there seemed to be a ring of exultation in their wild cry   as though they knew that their quarry was almost run to earth      not another step   said reuben lockarby  pulling up and drawing his  sword   if i must fight  i shall fight here       there could be no better place   i replied  two great jagged rocks rose  before us  jutting abruptly out of the ground  and leaving a space of  twelve or fifteen feet between them  through this gap we rode  and  i shouted loudly for saxon to join us  his horse  however  had been  steadily gaining upon ours  and at the renewed alarm had darted off  again  so that he was already some hundred yards from us  it was useless  to summon him  even could he hear our voices  for the hounds would be  upon us before he could return      never heed him   i said hurriedly   do you rein your steed behind  that rock  and i behind this  they will serve to break the force of the  attack  dismount not  but strike down  and strike hard      on either side in the shadow of the rock we waited in silence for our  terrible pursuers  looking back at it  my dear children  i cannot but  think that it was a great trial on such young soldiers as reuben and  myself to be put  on the first occasion of drawing our swords  into such  a position  for i have found  and others have confirmed my opinion   that of all dangers that a man is called upon to face  that arising from  savage and determined animals is the most unnerving  for with men there  is ever the chance that some trait of weakness or of want of courage may  give you an advantage over them  but with fierce beasts there is no such  hope  we knew that the creatures to whom we were opposed could never  be turned from our throats while there was breath in their bodies  one  feels in one s heart  too  that the combat is an unequal one  for your  life is precious at least to your friends  while their lives  what are  they  all this and a great deal more passed swiftly through our minds  as we sat with drawn swords  soothing our trembling horses as best we  might  and waiting for the coming of the hounds     nor had we long to wait  another long  deep  thunderous bay sounded  in our ears  followed by a profound silence  broken only by the quick  shivering breathing of the horses  then suddenly  and noiselessly  a  great tawny brute  with its black muzzle to the earth  and its overhung  cheeks napping on either side  sprang into the band of moonlight between  the rocks  and on into the shadow beyond  it never paused or swerved for  an instant  but pursued its course straight onwards without a glance  to right or to left  close behind it came a second  and behind that a  third  all of enormous size  and looking even larger and more terrible  than they were in the dim shifting light  like the first  they took no  notice of our presence  but bounded on along the trail left by decimus  saxon     the first and second i let pass  for i hardly realised that they so  completely overlooked us  when the third  however  sprang out into the  moonlight  i drew my right hand pistol from its holster  and resting  its long barrel across my left forearm  i fired at it as it passed  the  bullet struck the mark  for the brute gave a fierce howl of rage and  pain  but true to the scent it never turned or swerved  lockarby fired  also as it disappeared among the brushwood  but with no apparent effect   so swiftly and so noiselessly did the great hounds pass  that they might  have been grim silent spirits of the night  the phantom dogs of herne  the hunter  but for that one fierce yelp which followed my shot      what brutes   my companion ejaculated   what shall we do  micah       they have clearly been laid on saxon s trail   said i   we must follow  them up  or they will be too many for him  can you hear anything of our  pursuers       nothing       they have given up the chase  then  and let the dogs loose as a last  resource  doubtless the creatures are trained to return to the town  but  we must push on  reuben  if we are to help our companion       one more spurt  then  little dido   cried reuben   can you muster  strength for one more  nay  i have not the heart to put spurs to you  if  you can do it  i know you will      the brave mare snorted  as though she understood her riders words  and  stretched her weary limbs into a gallop  so stoutly did she answer the  appeal that  though i pressed covenant to his topmost speed  she was  never more than a few strides behind him      he took this direction   said i  peering anxiously out into the  darkness   he can scarce have gone far  for he spoke of making a stand   or  perhaps  finding that we are not with him  he may trust to the speed  of his horse       what chance hath a horse of outstripping these brutes   reuben  answered   they must run him to earth  and he knows it  hullo  what have  we here      a dark dim form lay stretched in the moonlight in front of us  it was  the dead body of a hound  the one evidently at which i had fired      there is one of them disposed of   i cried joyously   we have but two  to settle with now       as i spoke we heard the crack of two pistol shots some little distance  to the left  heading our steeds in that direction  we pressed on at the  top of our speed  presently out of the darkness in front of us there  arose such a roaring and a yelping as sent the hearts into our mouths   it was not a single cry  such as the hounds had uttered when they were  on the scent  but a continuous deep mouthed uproar  so fierce and so  prolonged  that we could not doubt that they had come to the end of  their run      pray god that they have not got him down   cried reuben  in a faltering  voice     the same thought had crossed my own mind  for i have heard a similar  though lesser din come from a pack of otter hounds when they had  overtaken their prey and were tearing it to pieces  sick at heart  i  drew my sword with the determination that  if we were too late to save  our companion  we should at least revenge him upon the four footed  fiends  bursting through a thick belt of scrub and tangled gorse bushes   we came upon a scene so unlike what we had expected that we pulled up  our horses in astonishment     a circular clearing lay in front of us  brightly illuminated by the  silvery moonshine  in the centre of this rose a giant stone  one  of those high dark columns which are found all over the plain  and  especially in the parts round stonehenge  it could not have been less  than fifteen feet in height  and had doubtless been originally straight   but wind and weather  or the crumbling of the soil  had gradually  suffered it to tilt over until it inclined at such an angle that an  active man might clamber up to the summit  on the top of this ancient  stone  cross legged and motionless  like some strange carved idol of  former days  sat decimus saxon  puffing sedately at the long pipe which  was ever his comfort in moments of difficulty  beneath him  at the base  of the monolith  as our learned men call them  the two great bloodhounds  were rearing and springing  clambering over each other s backs in their  frenzied and futile eagerness to reach the impassive figure perched  above them  while they gave vent to their rage and disappointment in the  hideous uproar which had suggested such terrible thoughts to our mind     we had little time  however  to gaze at this strange scene  for upon our  appearance the hounds abandoned their helpless attempts to reach saxon   and flew  with a fierce snarl of satisfaction  at reuben and myself   one great brute  with flaring eyes and yawning mouth  his white fangs  glistening in the moonlight  sprang at my horse s neck  but i met him  fair with a single sweeping cut  which shore away his muzzle  and left  him wallowing and writhing in a pool of blood  reuben  meanwhile  had  spurred his horse forward to meet his assailant  but the poor tired  steed flinched at the sight of the fierce hound  and pulled up suddenly   with the result that her rider rolled headlong into the very jaws of the  animal  it might have gone ill with reuben had he been left to his own  resources  at the most he could only have kept the cruel teeth from  his throat for a very few moments  but seeing the mischance  i drew my  remaining pistol  and springing from my horse  discharged it full into  the creature s flank while it struggled with my friend  with a last  yell of rage and pain it brought its fierce jaws together in one wild  impotent snap  and then sank slowly over upon its side  while reuben  crawled from beneath it  scared and bruised  but none the worse  otherwise for his perilous adventure      i owe you one for that  micah   he said gratefully   i may live to do  as much for you       and i owe ye both one   said saxon  who had scrambled down from his  place of refuge   i pay my debts  too  whether for good or evil  i might  have stayed up there until i had eaten my jack boots  for all the chance  i had of ever getting down again  sancta maria  but that was a shrewd  blow of yours  clarke  the brute s head flew in halves like a rotten  pumpkin  no wonder that they stuck to my track  for i have left both my  spare girth and my kerchief behind me  which would serve to put them on  chloe s scent as well as mine own       and where is chloe   i asked  wiping my sword      chloe had to look out for herself  i found the brutes gaining on me   you see  and i let drive at them with my barkers  but with a horse  flying at twenty mile an hour  what chance is there for a single slug  finding its way home   things looked black then  for i had no time to  reload  and the rapier  though the king of weapons in the duello  is  scarce strong enough to rely upon on an occasion like this  as luck  would have it  just as i was fairly puzzled  what should i come across  but this handy stone  which the good priests of old did erect  as far as  i can see  for no other purpose than to provide worthy cavalieros with  an escape from such ignoble and scurvy enemies  i had no time to spare  in clambering up it  for i had to tear my heel out of the mouth of the  foremost of them  and might have been dragged down by it had he not  found my spur too tough a morsel for his chewing  but surely one of my  bullets must have readied its mark   lighting the touch paper in his  tobacco box  he passed it over the body of the hound which had attacked  me  and then of the other      why  this one is riddled like a sieve   he cried   what do you load  your petronels with  good master clarke       with two leaden slugs       yet two leaden slugs have made a score of holes at the least  and of  all things in this world  here is the neck of a bottle stuck in the  brute s hide       good heavens   i exclaimed   i remember  my dear mother packed a bottle  of daffy s elixir in the barrel of my pistol       and you have shot it into the bloodhound   roared reuben   ho  ho  when  they hear that tale at the tap of the wheatsheaf  there will be some  throats dry with laughter  saved my life by shooting a dog with a bottle  of daffy s elixir       and a bullet as well  reuben  though i dare warrant the gossips will  soon contrive to leave that detail out  it is a mercy the pistol did not  burst  but what do you propose to do now  master saxon       why  to recover my mare if it can anywise be done   said the  adventurer   though on this vast moor  in the dark  she will be as  difficult to find as a scotsman s breeches or a flavourless line in   hudibras        and reuben lockarby s steed can go no further   i remarked   but do  mine eyes deceive me  or is there a glimmer of light over yonder       a will o  the wisp   said saxon                an  ignis fatuus  that bewitches              and leads men into pools and ditches      yet i confess that it burns steady and clear  as though it came from  lamp  candle  rushlight  lanthorn  or other human agency       where there is light there is life   cried reuben   let us make for it   and see what chance of shelter we may find there       it cannot come from our dragoon friends   remarked decimus   a murrain  on them  how came they to guess our true character  or was it on the  score of some insult to the regiment that that young fahnfuhrer has set  them on our track  if i have him at my sword s point again  he shall  not come off so free  well  do ye lead your horses  and we shall explore  this light  since no better course is open to us      picking our way across the moor  we directed our course for the bright  point which twinkled in the distance  and as we advanced we hazarded  a thousand conjectures as to whence it could come  if it were a human  dwelling  what sort of being could it be who  not content with living in  the heart of this wilderness  had chosen a spot so far removed from the  ordinary tracks which crossed it  the roadway was miles behind us  and  it was probable that no one save those driven by such a necessity as  that which had overtaken us would ever find themselves in that desolate  region  no hermit could have desired an abode more completely isolated  from all communion with his kind     as we approached we saw that the light did indeed come from a small  cottage  which was built in a hollow  so as to be invisible from any  quarter save that from which we approached it  in front of this humble  dwelling a small patch of ground had been cleared of shrub  and in the  centre of this little piece of sward our missing steed stood grazing at  her leisure upon the scanty herbage  the same light which had attracted  us had doubtless caught her eye  and drawn her towards it by hopes of  oats and of water  with a grunt of satisfaction saxon resumed possession  of his lost property  and leading her by the bridle  approached the door  of the solitary cottage         chapter xi  of the lonely man and the gold chest    the strong yellow glare which had attracted us across the moor found its  way out through a single narrow slit alongside the door which served the  purpose of a rude window  as we advanced towards it the light changed  suddenly to red  and that again to green  throwing a ghastly pallor over  our faces  and especially heightening the cadaverous effect of saxon s  austere features  at the same time we became aware of a most subtle  and noxious odour which poisoned the air all round the cottage   this combination of portents in so lonely a spot worked upon the old  man at arms  superstitious feelings to such an extent that he paused  and looked back at us inquiringly  both reuben and i were determined   however  to carry the adventure through  so he contented himself with  falling a little behind us  and pattering to himself some exorcism  appropriate to the occasion  walking up to the door  i rapped upon it  with the hilt of my sword and announced that we were weary travellers  who were seeking a night s shelter     the first result of my appeal was a sound as of some one bustling  rapidly about  with the clinking of metal and noise of the turning of  locks  this died away into a hush  and i was about to knock once more  when a crackling voice greeted us from the other side of the door      there is little shelter here  gentlemen  and less provisions   it said    it is but six miles to amesbury  where at the cecil arms ye shall find   i doubt not  all that is needful for man and for beast       nay  nay  mine invisible friend   quoth saxon  who was much reassured  by the sound of a human voice   this is surely but a scurvy reception   one of our horses is completely foundered  and none of them are in  very good plight  so that we could no more make for the cecil arms at  amesbury than for the gruner mann at lubeck  i prythee  therefore  that  you will allow us to pass the remainder of the night under your roof      at this appeal there was much creaking of locks and rasping of bolts   which ended in the door swinging slowly open  and disclosing the person  who had addressed us     by the strong light which shone out from behind him we could see that  he was a man of venerable aspect  with snow white hair and a countenance  which bespoke a thoughtful and yet fiery nature  the high pensive brow  and flowing beard smacked of the philosopher  but the keen sparkling  eye  the curved aquiline nose  and the lithe upright figure which the  weight of years had been unable to bend  were all suggestive of the  soldier  his lofty bearing  and his rich though severe costume of black  velvet  were at strange variance with the humble nature of the abode  which he had chosen for his dwelling place      ho   said he  looking keenly at us   two of ye unused to war  and the  other an old soldier  ye have been pursued  i see       how did you know that  then   asked decimus saxon      ah  my friend  i too have served in my time  my eyes are not so old but  that they can tell when horses have been spurred to the utmost  nor is  it difficult to see that this young giant s sword hath been employed in  something less innocent than toasting bacon  your story  however  can  keep  every true soldier thinks first of his horse  so i pray that you  will tether yours without  since i have neither ostler nor serving man  to whom i may entrust them      the strange dwelling into which we presently entered had been prolonged  into the side of the little hill against which it had been built  so  as to form a very long narrow hall  the ends of this great room  as we  entered  were wrapped in shadow  but in the centre was a bright glare  from a brazier full of coals  over which a brass pipkin was suspended   beside the fire a long wooden table was plentifully covered with curved  glass flasks  basins  tubings  and other instruments of which i knew  neither the name nor the purpose  a long row of bottles containing  various coloured liquids and powders were arranged along a shelf  whilst  above it another shelf bore a goodly array of brown volumes  for the  rest there was a second rough hewn table  a pair of cupboards  three or  four wooden settles  and several large screens pinned to the walls  and covered all over with figures and symbols  of which i could make  nothing  the vile smell which had greeted us outside was very much worse  within the chamber  and arose apparently from the fumes of the boiling   bubbling contents of the brazen pot      ye behold in me   said our host  bowing courteously to us   the last of  an ancient family  i am sir jacob clancing of snellaby hall       smellaby it should be  methinks   whispered reuben  in a voice which  fortunately did not reach the ears of the old knight      i pray that ye be seated   he continued   and that ye lay aside your  plates and headpieces  and remove your boots  consider this to be your  inn  and behave as freely  ye will hold me excused if for a moment i  turn my attention from you to this operation on which i am engaged   which will not brook delay      saxon began forthwith to undo his buckles and to pull off his harness   while reuben  throwing himself into a chair  appeared to be too weary  to do more than unfasten his sword belt  for my own part  i was glad  to throw off my gear  but i kept my attention all the while upon the  movements of our host  whose graceful manners and learned appearance had  aroused my curiosity and admiration     he approached the evil smelling pot  and stirred it up with a face  which indicated so much anxiety that it was clear that he had pushed his  courtesy to us so far as to risk the ruin of some important experiment   dipping his ladle into the compound  he scooped some up  and then poured  it slowly back into the vessel  showing a yellow turbid fluid  the  appearance of it evidently reassured him  for the look of anxiety  cleared away from his features  and he uttered an exclamation of relief   taking a handful of a whitish powder from a trencher at his side he  threw it into the pipkin  the contents of which began immediately to  seethe and froth over into the fire  causing the flames to assume  the strange greenish hue which we had observed before entering  this  treatment had the effect of clearing the fluid  for the chemist was  enabled to pour off into a bottle a quantity of perfectly watery  transparent liquid  while a brownish sediment remained in the vessel   and was emptied out upon a sheet of paper  this done  sir jacob clancing  pushed aside all his bottles  and turned towards us with a smiling face  and a lighter air      we shall see what my poor larder can furnish forth   said he    meanwhile  this odour may be offensive to your untrained nostrils  so  we shall away with it  he threw a few grains of some balsamic resin  into the brazier  which at once filled the chamber with a most agreeable  perfume  he then laid a white cloth upon the table  and taking from a  cupboard a dish of cold trout and a large meat pasty  he placed them  upon it  and invited us to draw up our settles and set to work      i would that i had more toothsome fare to offer ye   said he   were  we at snellaby hall  ye should not be put off in this scurvy fashion  i  promise ye  this may serve  however  for hungry men  and i can still  lay my hands upon a brace of bottles of the old alicant   so saying  he  brought a pair of flasks out from a recess  and having seen us served  and our glasses filled  he seated himself in a high backed oaken chair  and presided with old fashioned courtesy over our feast  as we supped  i  explained to him what our errand was  and narrated the adventures of the  night  without making mention of our destination      you are bound for monmouth s camp   he said quietly  when i had  finished  looking me full in the face with his keen dark eyes   i know  it  but ye need not fear lest i betray you  even were it in my power   what chance  think ye  hath the duke against the king s forces       as much chance as a farmyard fowl against a spurred gamecock  did he  rely only on those whom he hath with him   saxon answered   he hath  reason to think  however  that all england is like a powder magazine   and he hopes to be the spark to set it alight      the old man shook his head sadly   the king hath great resources   he  remarked   where is monmouth to get his trained soldiers       there is the militia   i suggested      and there are many of the old parliamentary breed  who are not too far  gone to strike a blow for their belief   said saxon   do you but get  half a dozen broad brimmed  snuffle nosed preachers into a camp  and the  whole presbytery tribe will swarm round them like flies on a honey pot   no recruiting sergeants will ever raise such an army as did noll s  preachers in the eastern counties  where the promise of a seat by the  throne was thought of more value than a ten pound bounty  i would i  could pay mine own debts with these same promises       i should judge from your speech  sir   our host observed   that you are  not one of the sectaries  how comes it  then  that you are throwing the  weight of your sword and your experience into the weaker scale       for the very reason that it is the weaker scale   said the soldier of  fortune   i should gladly have gone with my brother to the guinea coast  and had no say in the matter one way or the other  beyond delivering  letters and such trifles  since i must be doing something  i choose to  fight for protestantism and monmouth  it is nothing to me whether james  stuart or james walters sits upon the throne  but the court and army of  the king are already made up  now  since monmouth hath both courtiers  and soldiers to find  it may well happen that he may be glad of my  services and reward them with honourable preferment       your logic is sound   said our host   save only that you have omitted  the very great chance which you will incur of losing your head if the  duke s party are borne down by the odds against them       a man cannot throw a main without putting a stake on the board   said  saxon      and you  young sir   the old man asked   what has caused you to take a  hand in so dangerous a game       i come of a roundhead stock   i answered   and my folk have always  fought for the liberty of the people and the humbling of tyranny  i come  in the place of my father       and you  sir   our questioner continued  looking at reuben      i have come to see something of the world  and to be with my friend and  companion here   he replied      and i have stronger reasons than any of ye   sir jacob cried   for  appearing in arms against any man who bears the name of stuart  had i  not a mission here which cannot be neglected  i might myself be tempted  to hie westward with ye  and put these grey hairs of mine once more into  the rough clasp of a steel headpiece  for where now is the noble castle  of snellaby  and where those glades and woods amidst which the clancings  have grown up  and lived and died  ere ever norman william set his  foot on english soil  a man of trade  a man who  by the sweat of his  half starved workers  had laid by ill gotten wealth  is now the owner  of all that fair property  should i  the last of the clancings  show  my face upon it  i might be handed over to the village beadle as a  trespasser  or scourged off it perhaps by the bowstrings of insolent  huntsmen       and how comes so sudden a reverse of fortune   i asked      fill up your glasses   cried the old man  suiting the action to the  word   here s a toast for you  perdition to all faithless princes   how came it about  ye ask  why  when the troubles came upon the first  charles  i stood by him as though he had been mine own brother  at  edgehill  at naseby  in twenty skirmishes and battles  i fought stoutly  in his cause  maintaining a troop of horse at my own expense  formed  from among my own gardeners  grooms  and attendants  then the military  chest ran low  and money must be had to carry on the contest  my silver  chargers and candlesticks were thrown into the melting pot  as were  those of many another cavalier  they went in metal and they came out  as troopers and pikemen  so we tided over a few months until again the  purse was empty  and again we filled it amongst us  this time it was the  home farm and the oak trees that went  then came marston moor  and every  penny and man was needed to repair that great disaster  i flinched not   but gave everything  this boiler of soap  a prudent  fat cheeked man   had kept himself free from civil broils  and had long had a covetous eye  upon the castle  it was his ambition  poor worm  to be a gentleman  as  though a gabled roof and a crumbling house could ever make him that  i  let him have his way  however  and threw the sum received  every guinea  of it  into the king s coffers  and so i held out until the final ruin  of worcester  when i covered the retreat of the young prince  and may  indeed say that save in the isle of man i was the last royalist who  upheld the authority of the crown  the commonwealth had set a price upon  my head as a dangerous malignant  so i was forced to take my passage in  a harwich ketch  and arrived in the lowlands with nothing save my sword  and a few broad pieces in my pocket       a cavalier might do well even then   remarked saxon   there are ever  wars in germany where a man is worth his hire  when the north germans  are not in arms against the swedes or french  the south germans are sure  to be having a turn with the janissaries       i did indeed take arms for a time in the employ of the united  provinces  by which means i came face to face once more with mine old  foes  the roundheads  oliver had lent reynolds s brigade to the french   and right glad was louis to have the service of such seasoned troops    fore god  i stood on the counterscarp at dunkirk  and i found myself   when i should have been helping the defence  actually cheering on the  attack  my very heart rose when i saw the bull dog fellows clambering up  the breach with their pikes at the trail  and never quavering in their  psalm tune  though the bullets sung around them as thick as bees in the  hiving time  and when they did come to close hugs with the flemings  i  tell you they set up such a rough cry of soldierly joy that my pride  in them as englishmen overtopped my hatred of them as foes  however  my  soldiering was of no great duration  for peace was soon declared  and  i then pursued the study of chemistry  for which i had a strong turn   first with vorhaager of leyden  and later with de huy of strasburg   though i fear that these weighty names are but sounds to your ears       truly   said saxon   there seemeth to be some fatal attraction in this  same chemistry  for we met two officers of the blue guards in salisbury   who  though they were stout soldierly men in other respects  had also a  weakness in that direction       ha   cried sir jacob  with interest   to what school did they belong       nay  i know nothing of the matter   saxon answered   save that they  denied that gervinus of nurnberg  whom i guarded in prison  or any other  man  could transmute metals       for gervinus i cannot answer   said our host   but for the possibility  of it i can pledge my knightly word  however  of that anon  the time  came at last when the second charles was invited back to his throne   and all of us  from jeffrey hudson  the court dwarf  up to my lord  clarendon  were in high feather at the hope of regaining our own once  more  for my own claim  i let it stand for some time  thinking that it  would be a more graceful act for the king to help a poor cavalier who  had ruined himself for the sake of his family without solicitation on  his part  i waited and waited  but no word came  so at last i betook  myself to the levee and was duly presented to him   ah   said he   greeting me with the cordiality which he could assume so well   you  are  if i mistake not  sir jasper killigrew    nay  your majesty    i answered   i am sir jacob clancing  formerly of snellaby hall  in  staffordshire   and with that i reminded him of worcester fight and of  many passages which had occurred to us in common   od s fish   he cried    how could i be so forgetful  and how are all at snellaby   i then  explained to him that the hall had passed out of my hands  and told him  in a few words the state to which i had been reduced  his face clouded  over and his manner chilled to me at once   they are all on to me for  money and for places   he said   and truly the commons are so niggardly  to me that i can scarce be generous to others  however  sir jacob  we  shall see what can be done for thee   and with that he dismissed me   that same night the secretary of my lord clarendon came to me  and  announced with much form and show that  in consideration of my long  devotion and the losses which i had sustained  the king was graciously  pleased to make me a lottery cavalier       and pray  sir  what is a lottery cavalier   i asked      it is nothing else than a licensed keeper of a gambling house  this  was his reward to me  i was to be allowed to have a den in the piazza  of covent garden  and there to decoy the young sparks of the town and  fleece them at ombre  to restore my own fortunes i was to ruin others   my honour  my family  my reputation  they were all to weigh for  nothing so long as i had the means of bubbling a few fools out of their  guineas       i have heard that some of the lottery cavaliers did well   remarked  saxon reflectively      well or ill  it way no employment for me  i waited upon the king and  implored that his bounty would take another form  his only reply was  that for one so poor i was strangely fastidious  for weeks i hung about  the court  i and other poor cavaliers like myself  watching the royal  brothers squandering upon their gaming and their harlots sums which  would have restored us to our patrimonies  i have seen charles put upon  one turn of a card as much as would have satisfied the most exacting of  us  in the parks of st  james  or in the gallery at whitehall  i still  endeavoured to keep myself before his eyes  in the hope that some  provision would be made for me  at last i received a second message from  him  it was that unless i could dress more in the mode he could dispense  with my attendance  that was his message to the old broken soldier who  had sacrificed health  wealth  position  everything in the service of  his father and himself       shameful   we cried  all three      can you wonder  then  that i cursed the whole stuart race   false hearted  lecherous  and cruel  for the hall  i could buy it back  to morrow if i chose  but why should i do so when i have no heir       ho  you have prospered then   said decimus saxon  with one of his  shrewd sidelong looks   perhaps you have yourself found out how to  convert pots and pans into gold in the way you have spoken of  but that  cannot be  for i see iron and brass in this room which would hardly  remain there could you convert it to gold       gold has its uses  and iron has its uses   said sir jacob oracularly    the one can never supplant the other       yet these officers   i remarked   did declare to us that it was but a  superstition of the vulgar       then these officers did show that their knowledge was less than their  prejudice  alexander setonius  a scot  was first of the moderns to  achieve it  in the month of march      he did change a bar of lead into  gold in the house of a certain hansen  at rotterdam  who hath testified  to it  he then not only repeated the same process before three learned  men sent by the kaiser rudolph  but he taught johann wolfgang dienheim  of freibourg  and gustenhofer of strasburg  which latter taught it to my  own illustrious master        who in turn taught it to you   cried saxon triumphantly   i have no  great store of metal with me  good sir  but there are my head piece   back and breast plate  taslets and thigh pieces  together with my  sword  spurs  and the buckles of my harness  i pray you to use your most  excellent and praiseworthy art upon these  and i will promise within a  few days to bring round a mass of metal which shall be more worthy of  your skill       nay  nay   said the alchemist  smiling and shaking his head   it can  indeed be done  but only slowly and in order  small pieces at a time   and with much expenditure of work and patience  for a man to enrich  himself at it he must labour hard and long  yet in the end i will not  deny that he may compass it  and now  since the flasks are empty and  your young comrade is nodding in his chair  it will perhaps be as well  for you to spend as much of the night as is left in repose   he drew  several blankets and rugs from a corner and scattered them over the  floor   it is a soldier s couch   he remarked   but ye may sleep on  worse before ye put monmouth on the english throne  for myself  it is  my custom to sleep in an inside chamber  which is hollowed out of the  hill   with a few last words and precautions for our comfort he withdrew  with the lamp  passing through a door which had escaped our notice at  the further end of the apartment     reuben  having had no rest since he left havant  had already dropped  upon the rugs  and was fast asleep  with a saddle for a pillow  saxon  and i sat for a few minutes longer by the light of the burning brazier      one might do worse than take to this same chemical business   my  companion remarked  knocking the ashes out of his pipe   see you yon  iron bound chest in the corner       what of it       it is two thirds full of gold  which this worthy gentleman hath  manufactured       how know you that   i asked incredulously      when you did strike the door panel with the hilt of your sword  as  though you would drive it in  you may have heard some scuttling about   and the turning of a lock  well  thanks to my inches  i was able to look  through yon slit in the wall  and i saw our friend throw something into  the chest with a chink  and then lock it  it was but a glance at the  contents  yet i could swear that that dull yellow light could come from  no metal but gold  let us see if it be indeed locked   rising from his  seat he walked over to the box and pulled vigorously at the lid      forbear  saxon  forbear   i cried angrily   what would our host say   should he come upon you       nay  then  he should not keep such things beneath his roof  with a  chisel or a dagger now  this might be prized open       by heaven   i whispered   if you should attempt it i shall lay you on  your back       well  well  young anak  it was but a passing fancy to see the treasure  again  now  if he were but well favoured to the king  this would be  fair prize of war  marked ye not that he claimed to have been the last  royalist who drew sword in england  and he confessed that he had been  proscribed as a malignant  your father  godly as he is  would have  little compunction in despoiling such an amalekite  besides  bethink  you  he can make more as easily as your good mother maketh cranberry  dumplings       enough said   i answered sternly   it will not bear discussion  get ye  to your couch  lest i summon our host and tell him what manner of man he  hath entertained      with many grumbles saxon consented at last to curl his long limbs up  upon a mat  whilst i lay by his side and remained awake until the mellow  light of morning streamed through the chinks between the ill covered  rafters  truth to tell  i feared to sleep  lest the freebooting habits  of the soldier of fortune should be too strong for him  and he should  disgrace us in the eyes of our kindly and generous entertainer  at last   however  his long drawn breathing assured me that he was asleep  and i  was able to settle down to a few hours of welcome rest         chapter xii  of certain passages upon the moor    in the morning  after a breakfast furnished by the remains of our  supper  we looked to our horses and prepared for our departure  ere we  could mount  however  our kindly host came running out to us with a load  of armour in his arms      come hither   said he  beckoning to reuben   it is not meet  lad  that  you should go bare breasted against the enemy when your comrades are  girt with steel  i have here mine own old breastplate and head piece   which should  methinks  fit you  for if you have more flesh than i  i am  a larger framework of a man  ah  said i not so  were t measured for you  by silas thomson  the court armourer  it could not grip better  now  on with the head piece  a close fit again  you are now a cavalier whom  monmouth or any other leader might be proud to see ride beneath his  banner      both helmet and body plates were of the finest milan steel  richly  inlaid with silver and with gold  and carved all over in rare and  curious devices  so stern and soldierly was the effect  that the  ruddy  kindly visage of our friend staring out of such a panoply had an  ill matched and somewhat ludicrous appearance      nay  nay   cried the old cavalier  seeing a smile upon our features    it is but right that so precious a jewel as a faithful heart should  have a fitting casket to protect it       i am truly beholden to you  sir   said reuben   i can scarce find words  to express my thanks  holy mother  i have a mind to ride straight back  to havant  to show them how stout a man at arms hath been reared amongst  them       it is steel of proof   sir jacob remarked   a pistol bullet might  glance from it  and you   he continued  turning to me   here is a small  gift by which you shall remember this meeting  i did observe that you  did cast a wistful eye upon my bookshelf  it is plutarch s lives of the  ancient worthies  done into english by the ingenious mr  latimer  carry  this volume with you  and shape your life after the example of the giant  men whose deeds are here set forth  in your saddle bag i place a small  but weighty packet  which i desire you to hand over to monmouth upon  the day of your arrival in his camp  as to you  sir   addressing decimus  saxon   here is a slug of virgin gold for you  which may fashion into a  pin or such like ornament  you may wear it with a quiet conscience  for  it is fairly given to you and not filched from your entertainer whilst  he slept      saxon and i shot a sharp glance of surprise at each other at this  speech  which showed that our words of the night before were not unknown  to him  sir jacob  however  showed no signs of anger  but proceeded to  point out our road and to advise us as to our journey      you must follow this sheep track until you come on another and broader  pathway which makes for the west   said he   it is little used  and  there is small chance of your falling in with any of your enemies upon  it  this path will lead you between the villages of fovant and hindon   and soon to mere  which is no great distance from bruton  upon the  somersetshire border      thanking our venerable host for his great kindness towards us we gave  rein to our horses  and left him once more to the strange solitary  existence in which we had found him  so artfully had the site of  his cottage been chosen  that when we looked back to give him a last  greeting both he and his dwelling had disappeared already from our view   nor could we  among the many mounds and hollows  determine where the  cottage lay which had given us such welcome shelter  in front of us and  on either side the great uneven dun coloured plain stretched away to the  horizon  without a break in its barren gorse covered surface  over the  whole expanse there was no sign of life  save for an occasional rabbit  which whisked into its burrow on hearing our approach  or a few thin and  hungry sheep  who could scarce sustain life by feeding on the coarse and  wiry grass which sprang from the unfruitful soil     the pathway was so narrow that only one of us could ride upon it at a  time  but we presently abandoned it altogether  using it simply as a  guide  and galloping along side by side over the rolling plain  we were  all silent  reuben meditating upon his new corslet  as i could see from  his frequent glances at it  while saxon  with his eyes half closed  was  brooding over some matter of his own  for my own part  my thoughts ran  upon the ignominy of the old soldier s designs upon the gold chest  and  the additional shame which rose from the knowledge that our host had in  some way divined his intention  no good could come of an alliance with a  man so devoid of all feelings of honour or of gratitude  so strongly did  i feel upon it that i at last broke the silence by pointing to a  cross path  which turned away from the one which we were pursuing  and  recommending him to follow it  since he had proved that he was no fit  company for honest men      by the living rood   he cried  laying his hand upon the hilt of his  rapier   have you taken leave of your senses  these are words such as no  honourable cavaliero can abide       they are none the less words of truth   i answered     his blade flashed out in an instant  while his mare bounded twice her  length under the sharp dig of his spurs      we have here   he cried  reining her round  with his fierce lean face  all of a quiver with passion   an excellent level stretch on which to  discuss the matter  out with your bilbo and maintain your words       i shall not stir a hair s breadth to attack you   i answered   why  should i  when i bear you no ill will  if you come against me  however   i will assuredly beat you out of your saddle  for all your tricky sword  play   i drew my broadsword as i spoke  and stood upon my guard  for i  guessed that with so old a soldier the onset would be sharp and sudden      by all the saints in heaven   cried reuben   which ever of ye strikes  first at the other i ll snap this pistol at his head  none of your  jokes  don decimo  for by the lord i ll let drive at you if you were my  own mother s son  put up your sword  for the trigger falls easy  and my  finger is a twitching       curse you for a spoil sport   growled saxon  sulkily sheathing his  weapon   nay  clarke   he added  after a few moments of reflection    this is but child s play  that two camarados with a purpose in view  should fall out over such a trifle  i  who am old enough to be your  father  should have known better than to have drawn upon you  for a  boy s tongue wags on impulse and without due thought  do but say that  you have said more than you meant       my way of saying it may have been over plain and rough   i answered   for i saw that he did but want a little salve where my short words had  galled him   at the same time  our ways differ from your ways  and that  difference must be mended  or you can be no true comrade of ours       all right  master morality   quoth he   i must e en unlearn some of the  tricks of my trade  od s feet  man  if ye object to me  what the henker  would ye think of some whom i have known  however  let that pass  it  is time that we were at the wars  for our good swords will not bide in  their scabbards                the trenchant blade  toledo trusty              for want of fighting was grown rusty              and ate into itself for lack             of somebody to hew and hack      you cannot think a thought but old samuel hath been before you       surely we shall be at the end of this dreary plain presently   reuben  cried   its insipid flatness is enough to set the best of friends by the  ears  we might be in the deserts of libya instead of his most graceless  majesty s county of wiltshire       there is smoke over yonder  upon the side of that hill   said saxon   pointing to the southward      methinks i see one straight line of houses there   i observed  shading  my eyes with my hand   but it is distant  and the shimmer of the sun  disturbs the sight       it must be the hamlet of hindon   said reuben   oh  the heat of this  steel coat  i wonder if it were very un soldierly to slip it off and tie  it about dido s neck  i shall be baked alive else  like a crab in its  shell  how say you  illustrious  is it contravened by any of those  thirty nine articles of war which you bear about in your bosom       the bearing of the weight of your harness  young man   saxon answered  gravely   is one of the exercises of war  and as such only attainable by  such practice as you are now undergoing  you have many things to learn   and one of them is not to present petronels too readily at folk s heads  when you are on horseback  the jerk of your charger s movement even now  might have drawn your trigger  and so deprived monmouth of an old and  tried soldier       there would be much weight in your contention   my friend answered    were it not that i now bethink me that i had forgot to recharge my  pistol since discharging it at that great yellow beast yesternight      decimus saxon shook his head sadly   i doubt we shall never make a  soldier of you   he remarked   you fall from your horse if the brute  does bit change his step  you show a levity which will not jump with the  gravity of the true soldado  you present empty petronels as a menace   and finally  you crave permission to tie your armour  armour which the  cid himself might be proud to wear  around the neck of your horse  yet  you have heart and mettle  i believe  else you would not be here       gracias  signor   cried reuben  with a bow which nearly unhorsed him    the last remark makes up for all the rest  else had i been forced to  cross blades with you  to maintain my soldierly repute       touching that same incident last night   said saxon   of the chest  filled  as i surmise  with gold  which i was inclined to take as lawful  plunder  i am now ready to admit that i may have shown an undue haste  and precipitance  considering that the old man treated us fairly       say no more of it   i answered   if you will but guard against such  impulses for the future       they do not properly come from me   he replied   but from will  spotterbridge  who was a man of no character at all       and how comes he to be mixed up in the matter   i asked curiously      why  marry  in this wise  my father married the daughter of this same  will spotterbridge  and so weakened a good old stock by an unhealthy  strain  will was a rake hell of fleet street in the days of james  a  chosen light of alsatia  the home of bullies and of brawlers  his blood  hath through his daughter been transmitted to the ten of us  though i  rejoice to say that i  being the tenth  it had by that time lost much  of its virulence  and indeed amounts to little more than a proper pride   and a laudable desire to prosper       how  then  has it affected the race   i asked      why   he answered   the saxons of old were a round faced  contented  generation  with their ledgers in their hands for six days and their  bibles on the seventh  if my father did but drink a cup of small beer  more than his wont  or did break out upon provocation into any fond  oath  as  od s niggers   or  heart alive   he would mourn over it as  though it were the seven deadly sins  was this a man  think ye  in the  ordinary course of nature to beget ten long lanky children  nine of  whom might have been first cousins of lucifer  and foster brothers of  beelzebub       it was hard upon him   remarked reuben      on him  nay  the hardship was all with us  if he with his eyes  open chose to marry the daughter of an incarnate devil like will  spotterbridge  because she chanced to be powdered and patched to his  liking  what reason hath he for complaint  it is we  who have the blood  of this hector of the taverns grafted upon our own good honest stream   who have most reason to lift up our voices       faith  by the same chain of reasoning   said reuben   one of my  ancestors must have married a woman with a plaguy dry throat  for both  my father and i are much troubled with the complaint       you have assuredly inherited a plaguy pert tongue   growled saxon    from what i have told you  you will see that our whole life is a  conflict between our natural saxon virtue and the ungodly impulses of  the spotterbridge taint  that of which you have had cause to complain  yesternight is but an example of the evil to which i am subjected       and your brothers and sisters   i asked   how hath this circumstance  affected them   the road was bleak and long  so that the old soldier s  gossip was a welcome break to the tedium of the journey      they have all succumbed   said saxon  with a groan   alas  alas  they  were a goodly company could they have turned their talents to better  uses  prima was our eldest born  she did well until she attained  womanhood  secundus was a stout seaman  and owned his own vessel when  he was yet a young man  it was remarked  however  that he started on a  voyage in a schooner and came back in a brig  which gave rise to some  inquiry  it may be  as he said  that he found it drifting about in the  north sea  and abandoned his own vessel in favour of it  but they hung  him before he could prove it  tertia ran away with a north country  drover  and hath been on the run ever since  quartus and nonus have been  long engaged in busying themselves over the rescue of the black folk  from their own benighted and heathen country  conveying them over by the  shipload to the plantations  where they may learn the beauties of the  christian religion  they are  however  men of violent temper and profane  speech  who cherish no affection for their younger brother  quintus was  a lad of promise  but he found a hogshead of rumbo which was thrown up  from a wreck  and he died soon afterwards  sextus might have done well   for he became clerk to johnny tranter the attorney  but he was of an  enterprising turn  and he shifted the whole business  papers  cash  and  all to the lowlands  to the no small inconvenience of his employer  who  hath never been able to lay hands either on one or the other from that  day to this  septimus died young  as to octavius  will spotterbridge  broke out early in him  and he was slain in a quarrel over some dice   which were said by his enemies to be so weighted that the six must ever  come upwards  let this moving recital be a warning to ye  if ye are  fools enough to saddle yourselves with a wife  to see that she hath  no vice in her  for a fair face is a sorry make weight against a foul  mind      reuben and i could not but laugh over this frank family confession   which our companion delivered without a sign of shame or embarrassment    ye have paid a heavy price for your father s want of discretion   i  remarked   but what in the name of fate is this upon our left       a gibbet  by the look of it   said saxon  peering across at the gaunt  framework of wood  which rose up from a little knoll   let us ride past  it  for it is little out of our way  they are rare things in england   though by my faith there were more gallows than milestones when turenne  was in the palatinate  what between the spies and traitors who were bred  by the war  the rascally schwartzritter and lanzknechte  the bohemian  vagabonds  and an occasional countryman who was put out of the way lest  he do something amiss  there was never such a brave time for the crows      as we approached this lonely gibbet we saw that a dried up wisp of a  thing which could hardly be recognised as having once been a human being  was dangling from the centre of it  this wretched relic of mortality  was secured to the cross bar by an iron chain  and flapped drearily  backwards and forwards in the summer breeze  we had pulled up our  horses  and were gazing in silence at this sign post of death  when what  had seemed to us to be a bundle of rags thrown down at the foot of the  gallows began suddenly to move  and turned towards us the wizened face  of an aged woman  so marked with evil passions and so malignant in its  expression that it inspired us with even more horror than the unclean  thing which dangled above her head      gott in himmel   cried saxon   it is ever thus  a gibbet draws witches  as a magnet draws needles  all the hexerei of the country side will sit  round one  like cats round a milk pail  beware of her  she hath the evil  eye       poor soul  it is the evil stomach that she hath   said reuben  walking  his horse up to her   whoever saw such a bag of bones  i warrant that  she is pining away for want of a crust of bread      the creature whined  and thrust out two skinny claws to grab the piece  of silver which our friend had thrown down to her  her fierce dark  eyes and beak like nose  with the gaunt bones over which the yellow  parchment like skin was stretched tightly  gave her a fear inspiring  aspect  like some foul bird of prey  or one of those vampires of whom  the story tellers write      what use is money in the wilderness   i remarked   she cannot feed  herself upon a silver piece      she tied the coin hurriedly into the corner of her rags  as though she  feared that i might try to wrest it from her   it will buy bread   she  croaked      but who is there to sell it  good mistress   i asked      they sell it at fovant  and they sell it at hindon   she answered   i  bide here o  days  but i travel at night       i warrant she does  and on a broomstick   quoth saxon   but tell us   mother  who is it who hangs above your head       it is he who slew my youngest born   cried the old woman  casting a  malignant look at the mummy above her  and shaking a clenched hand at it  which was hardly more fleshy than its own   it is he who slew my bonny  boy  out here upon the wide moor he met him  and he took his young life  from him when no kind hand was near to stop the blow  on that ground  there my lad s blood was shed  and from that watering hath grown this  goodly gallows tree with its fine ripe fruit upon it  and here  come  rain  come shine  shall i  his mother  sit while two bones hang together  of the man who slow my heart s darling   she nestled down in her rags  as she spoke  and leaning her chin upon her hands stared up with an  intensity of hatred at the hideous remnant      come away  reuben   i cried  for the sight was enough to make one  loathe one s kind   she is a ghoul  not a woman       pah  it gives one a foul taste in the mouth   quoth saxon   who is for  a fresh gallop over the downs  away with care and carrion                sir john got on his bonny brown steed              to monmouth for to ride  a              a brave buff coat upon his back              a broadsword by his side  a              ha  ha  young man  we rebels can             pull down king james s pride  a      hark away  lads  with a loose rein and a bloody heel      we spurred our steeds and galloped from the unholy spot as fast as our  brave beasts could carry us  to all of us the air had a purer flavour  and the heath a sweeter scent by contrast with the grim couple whom we  had left behind us  what a sweet world would this be  my children  were  it not for man and his cruel ways     when we at last pulled up we had set some three or four miles between  the gibbet and ourselves  right over against us  on the side of a gentle  slope  stood a bright little village  with a red roofed church rising up  from amidst a clump of trees  to our eyes  after the dull sward of the  plain  it was a glad sight to see the green spread of the branches and  the pleasant gardens which girt the hamlet round  all morning we had  seen no sight of a human being  save the old hag upon the moor and a few  peat cutters in the distance  our belts  too  were beginning to be loose  upon us  and the remembrance of our breakfast more faint      this   said i   must be the village of mere  which we were to pass  before coming to bruton  we shall soon be over the somersetshire  border       i trust that we shall soon be over a dish of beefsteaks   groaned  reuben   i am well nigh famished  so fair a village must needs have a  passable inn  though i have not seen one yet upon my travels which would  compare with the old wheatsheaf       neither inn nor dinner for us just yet   said saxon   look yonder to  the north  and tell me what you see      on the extreme horizon there was visible a long line of gleaming   glittering points  which shone and sparkled like a string of diamonds   these brilliant specks were all in rapid motion  and yet kept their  positions to each other      what is it  then   we both cried      horse upon the march   quoth saxon   it may be our friends of  salisbury  who have made a long day s journey  or  as i am inclined  to think  it may be some other body of the king s horse  they are far  distant  and what we see is but the sun shining on their casques  yet  they are bound for this very village  if i mistake not  it would be  wisest to avoid entering it  lest the rustics set them upon our track   let us skirt it and push on for bruton  where we may spare time for bite  and sup       alas  alas  for our dinners   cried reuben ruefully   i have fallen  away until my body rattles about  inside this shell of armour  like a  pea in a pod  however  lads  it is all for the protestant faith       one more good stretch to bruton  and we may rest in peace   said saxon    it is ill dining when a dragoon may be served up as a grace after meat   our horses are still fresh  and we should be there in little over an  hour      we pushed on our way accordingly  passing at a safe distance from mere   which is the village where the second charles did conceal himself after  the battle of worcester  the road beyond was much crowded by peasants   who were making their way out of somersetshire  and by farmers  waggons   which were taking loads of food to the west  ready to turn a few guineas  either from the king s men or from the rebels  we questioned many as to  the news from the war  but though we were now on the outskirts of the  disturbed country  we could gain no clear account of how matters stood   save that all agreed that the rising was on the increase  the country  through which we rode was a beautiful one  consisting of low swelling  hills  well tilled and watered by numerous streamlets  crossing over the  river brue by a good stone bridge  we at last reached the small country  town for which we had been making  which lies embowered in the midst of  a broad expanse of fertile meadows  orchards  and sheep walks  from the  rising ground by the town we looked back over the plain without seeing  any traces of the troopers  we learned  too  from an old woman of the  place  that though a troop of the wiltshire yeomanry had passed through  the day before  there were no soldiers quartered at present in the  neighbourhood  thus assured we rode boldly into the town  and soon found  our way to the principal inn  i have some dim remembrance of an  ancient church upon an eminence  and of a quaint stone cross within the  market place  but assuredly  of all the recollections which i retain of  bruton there is none so pleasing as that of the buxom landlady s face   and of the steaming dishes which she lost no time in setting before us         chapter xiii  of sir gervas jerome  knight banneret of the county of  surrey    the inn was very full of company  being occupied not only by many  government agents and couriers on their way to and from the seat of  the rising  but also by all the local gossips  who gathered there to  exchange news and consume dame hobson the landlady s home brewed  in  spite  however  of this stress of custom and the consequent uproar  the  hostess conducted us into her own private room  where we could consume  her excellent cheer in peace and quietness  this favour was due  i  think  to a little sly manoeuvring and a few whispered words from saxon   who amongst other accomplishments which he had picked up during his  chequered career had a pleasing knack of establishing friendly relations  with the fair sex  irrespective of age  size  or character  gentle  and simple  church and dissent  whig and tory  if they did but wear a  petticoat our comrade never failed  in spite of his fifty years  to make  his way into their good graces by the help of his voluble tongue mid  assured manner      we are your grateful servants  mistress   said he  when the smoking  joint and the batter pudding had been placed upon the table   we have  robbed you of your room  will you not honour us so far as to sit down  with us and share our repast       nay  kind sir   said the portly dame  much flattered by the proposal    it is not for me to sit with gentles like yourselves       beauty has a claim which persons of quality  and above all cavalieros  of the sword  are the first to acknowledge   cried saxon  with his  little twinkling eyes fixed in admiration upon her buxom countenance    nay  by my troth  you shall not leave us  i shall lock the door first   if you will not eat  you shall at least drink a cup of alicant with me       nay  sir  it is too much honour   cried dame hobson  with a simper   i  shall go down into the cellars and bring a flask of the best       nay  by my manhood  you shall not   said saxon  springing up from his  seat   what are all these infernal lazy drawers here for if you are to  descend to menial offices   handing the widow to a chair he clanked away  into the tap room  where we heard him swearing at the men servants  and  cursing them for a droning set of rascals who had taken advantage of  the angelic goodness of their mistress and her incomparable sweetness of  temper      here is the wine  fair mistress   said he  returning presently with a  bottle in either hand   let me fill your glass  ha  it flows clear and  yellow like a prime vintage  these rogues can stir their limbs when they  find that there is a man to command them       would that there were ever such   said the widow meaningly  with a  languishing look at our companion   here is to you  sir  and to ye  too   young sirs   she added  sipping at her wine   may there be a speedy end  to the insurrection  for i judge  from your gallant equipment  that ye  be serving the king       his business takes us to the west   said reuben   and we have every  reason to hope that there will be a speedy end to the insurrection       aye  aye  though blood will be shed first   she said  shaking her head    they tell me that the rebels are as many as seven thousand  and that  they swear to give an  take no quarter  the murderous villains  alas   how any gentleman can fall to such bloody work when he might have a  clean honourable occupation  such as innkeeping or the like  is more  than my poor mind can understand  there is a sad difference betwixt the  man who lieth on the cold ground  not knowing how long it may be before  he is three feet deep in it  and he who passeth his nights upon a warm  feather bed  with mayhap a cellar beneath it stocked with even such  wines as we are now drinking   she again looked hard at saxon as she  spoke  while reuben and i nudged each other beneath the table      this business hath doubtless increased your trade  fair mistress    quoth saxon      aye  and in the way that payeth best   said she   the few kilderkins of  beer which are drunk by the common folk make little difference one way  or the other  but now  when we have lieutenants of counties  officers   mayors  and gentry spurring it for very life down the highways  i have  sold more of my rare old wines in three days than ever i did before in  a calendar month  it is not ale  or strong waters  i promise you  that  those gentles drink  but priniac  languedoc  tent  muscadine  chiante   and tokay  never a flask under the half guinea       so indeed   quoth saxon thoughtfully   a snug home and a steady  income       would that my poor peter had lived to share it with me   said dame  hobson  laying down her glass  and rubbing her eyes with a corner of  her kerchief   he was a good man  poor soul  though in very truth and  between friends he did at last become as broad and as thick as one of  his own puncheons  all well  the heart is the thing  marry come up  if a  woman were ever to wait until her own fancy came her way  there would be  more maids than mothers in the land       prythee  good dame  how runs your own fancy   asked reuben  mischievously      not in the direction of fat  young man   she answered smartly  with a  merry glance at our plump companion      she has hit you there  reuben   said i      i would have no pert young springald   she continued   but one who hath  knowledge of the world  and ripe experience  tall he should be  and of  sinewy build  free of speech that he might lighten the weary hours  and  help entertain the gentles when they crack a flagon of wine  of business  habits he must be  too  forsooth  for is there not a busy hostel and two  hundred good pounds a year to pass through his fingers  if jane hobson  is to be led to the altar again it must be by such a man as this      saxon had listened with much attention to the widow s words  and had  just opened his mouth to make some reply to her when a clattering and  bustle outside announced the arrival of some traveller  our  hostess drank off her wine and pricked up her ears  but when a loud  authoritative voice was heard in the passage  demanding a private room  and a draught of sack  her call to duty overcame her private concerns   and she bustled off with a few words of apology to take the measure of  the new comer      body o  me  lads   quoth decimus saxon the moment that she disappeared    ye can see how the land lies  i have half a mind to let monmouth carve  his own road  and to pitch my tent in this quiet english township       your tent  indeed   cried reuben   it is a brave tent that is furnished  with cellars of such wine as we are drinking  and as to the quiet  my  illustrious  if you take up your residence here i ll warrant that the  quiet soon comes to an end       you have seen the woman   said saxon  with his brow all in a wrinkle  with thought   she hath much to commend her  a man must look to himself   two hundred pounds a year are not to be picked off the roadside every  june morning  it is not princely  but it is something for an old soldier  of fortune who hath been in the wars for five and thirty years  and  foresees the time when his limbs will grow stiff in his harness  what  sayeth our learned fleming   an mulier    but what in the name of the  devil have we here      our companion s ejaculation was called forth by a noise as of a slight  scuffle outside the door  with a smothered  oh  sir   and  what will the  maids think   the contest was terminated by the door being opened  and  dame hobson re entering the room with her face in a glow  and a slim  young man dressed in the height of fashion at her heels      i am sure  good gentlemen   said she   that ye will not object to this  young nobleman drinking his wine in the same room with ye  since all the  others are filled with the townsfolk and commonalty       faith  i must needs be mine own usher   said the stranger  sticking his  gold laced cap under his left arm and laying his hand upon his heart   while he bowed until his forehead nearly struck the edge of the table    your very humble servant  gentlemen  sir gervas jerome  knight banneret  of his majesty s county of surrey  and at one time custos rotulorum of  the district of beacham ford       welcome  sir   quoth reuben  with a merry twinkle in his eye   you have  before you don decimo saxon of the spanish nobility  together with sir  micah clarke and sir reuben lockarby  both of his majesty s county of  hampshire       proud and glad to meet ye  gentlemen   cried the newcomer  with a  flourish   but what is this upon the table  alicant  fie  fie  it is a  drink for boys  let us have some good sack with plenty of body in it   claret for youth  say i  sack for maturity  and strong waters in old  age  fly  my sweetest  move those dainty feet of thine  for egad  my  throat is like leather  od s  oons  i drank deep last night  and yet  it is clear that i could not have drunk enough  for i was as dry as a  concordance when i awoke      saxon sat silently at the table  looking so viciously at the stranger  out of his half closed glittering eyes that i feared that we should  have another such brawl as occurred at salisbury  with perhaps a more  unpleasant ending  finally  however  his ill humour at the gallant s  free and easy attention to our hostess spent itself in a few muttered  oaths  and he lit his long pipe  the never failing remedy of a ruffled  spirit  as to reuben and myself  we watched our new companion half in  wonder and half in amusement  for his appearance and manners were novel  enough to raise the interest of inexperienced youngsters like ourselves     i have said that he was dressed in the height of fashion  and such  indeed was the impression which a glance would give  his face was thin  and aristocratic  with a well marked nose  delicate features  and gay  careless expression  some little paleness of the cheeks and darkness  under the eyes  the result of hard travel or dissipation  did but add a  chastening grace to his appearance  his white periwig  velvet and silver  riding coat  lavender vest and red satin knee breeches were all of the  best style and cut  but when looked at closely  each and all of these  articles of attire bore evidence of having seen better days  beside the  dust and stains of travel  there was a shininess or a fading of colour  here and there which scarce accorded with the costliness of their  material or the bearing of their wearer  his long riding boots had a  gaping seam in the side of one of them  whilst his toe was pushing  its way through the end of the other  for the rest  he wore a handsome  silver hilted rapier at his side  and had a frilled cambric shirt  somewhat the worse for wear and open at the front  as was the mode with  the gallants of those days  all the time he was speaking he mumbled a  toothpick  which together with his constant habit of pronouncing his  o s as a s made his conversation sound strange to our ears   note d  appendix  whilst we were noting these peculiarities he was reclining  upon dame hobson s best taffatta covered settee  tranquilly combing his  wig with a delicate ivory comb which he had taken from a small satin bag  which hung upon the right of his sword belt      lard preserve us from country inns   he remarked   what with the boors  that swarm in every chamber  and the want of mirrors  and jasmine water   and other necessaries  blister me if one has not to do one s toilet  in the common room   oons  i d as soon travel in the land of the great  mogul       when you shall come to be my age  young sir   saxon answered   you may  know better than to decry a comfortable country hostel       very like  sir  very like   the gallant answered  with a careless  laugh   for all that  being mine own age  i feel the wilds of wiltshire  and the inns of bruton to be a sorry change after the mall  and the fare  of pontack s or the coca tree  ah  lud  here comes the sack  open it  my  pretty hebe  and send a drawer with fresh glasses  for these gentlemen  must do me the honour of drinking with me  a pinch of snuff  sirs  aye   ye may well look hard at the box  a pretty little thing  sirs  from a  certain lady of title  who shall be nameless  though  if i were to say  that her title begins with a d and her name with a c  a gentleman of the  court might hazard a guess      our hostess  having brought fresh glasses  withdrew  and decimus  saxon soon found an opportunity for following her  sir gervas jerome  continued  however  to chatter freely to reuben and myself over  the wine  rattling along as gaily and airily as though we were old  acquaintances      sink me  if i have not frighted your comrade away   he remarked   or is  it possible that he hath gone on the slot of the plump widow  methought  he looked in no very good temper when i kissed her at the door  yet it  is a civility which i seldom refuse to anything which wears a cap  your  friend s appearance smacked more of mars than of venus  though  indeed   those who worship the god are wont to be on good terms with the goddess   a hardy old soldier  i should judge  from his feature and attire       one who hath seen much service abroad   i answered      ha  ye are lucky to ride to the wars in the company of so accomplished  a cavalier  for i presume that it is to the wars that ye are riding   since ye are all so armed and accoutred       we are indeed bound for the west   i replied  with some reserve  for in  saxon s absence i did not care to be too loose tongued      and in what capacity   he persisted   will ye risk your crowns in  defence of king james s one  or will ye strike in  hit or miss  with  these rogues of devon and somerset  stop my vital breath  if i would not  as soon side with the clown as with the crown  with all due respect to  your own principles       you are a daring man   said i   if you air your opinions thus in every  inn parlour  dost not know that a word of what you have said  whispered  to the nearest justice of the peace  might mean your liberty  if not  your life       i don t care the rind of a rotten orange for life or liberty either    cried our acquaintance  snapping his finger and thumb   burn me if  it wouldn t be a new sensation to bandy words with some heavy chopped  country justice  with the popish plot still stuck in his gizzard  and  be thereafter consigned to a dungeon  like the hero in john dryden s  latest  i have been round housed many a time by the watch in the old  hawkubite days  but this would be a more dramatic matter  with high  treason  block  and axe all looming in the background       and rack and pincers for a prologue   said reuben   this ambition is  the strangest that i have ever heard tell of       anything for a change   cried sir gervas  filling up a bumper   here s  to the maid that s next our heart  and here s to the heart that loves  the maids  war  wine  and women   twould be a dull world without them   but you have not answered my question       why truly  sir   said i   frank as you have been with us  i can scarce  be equally so with you  without the permission of the gentleman who has  just left the room  he is the leader of our party  pleasant as our short  intercourse has been  these are parlous times  and hasty confidences are  apt to lead to repentance       a daniel come to judgment   cried our new acquaintance   what ancient   ancient words from so young a head  you are  i ll warrant  five years  younger than a scatterbrain like myself  and yet you talk like the seven  wise men of greece  wilt take me as a valet       a valet   i exclaimed      aye  a valet  a man servant  i have been waited upon so long that it is  my turn to wait now  and i would not wish a more likely master  by the  lard  i must  in applying for a place  give an account of my character  and a list of my accomplishments  so my rascals ever did with me  though  in good truth i seldom listened to their recital  honesty  there i  score a trick  sober  ananias himself could scarce say that i am  that  trustworthy  indifferently so  steady  hum  about as much so  as garraway s weathercock  hang it  man  i am choke full of good  resolutions  but a sparkling glass or a roguish eye will deflect me  as  the mariners say of the compass  so much for my weaknesses  now let me  see what qualifications i can produce  a steady nerve  save only when i  have my morning qualms  and a cheerful heart  i score two on that  i  can dance saraband  minuet  or corranto  fence  ride  and sing french  chansons  good lard  who ever heard a valet urge such accomplishments  i  can play the best game of piquet in london  so said sir george etherege  when i won a cool thousand off him at the groom parter  but that won t  advance me much  either  what is there  then  to commend me  why  marry   i can brew a bowl of punch  and i can broil a devilled fowl  it is not  much  but i can do it well       truly  good sir   i said  with a smile   neither of these  accomplishments is like to prove of much use to us on our present  errand  you do  however  but jest  no doubt  when you talk of descending  to such a position       not a whit  not a whit   he replied earnestly    to such base uses do  we come   as will shakespeare has it  if you would be able to say that  you have in your service sir gervas jerome  knight banneret  and sole  owner of beacham ford park  with a rent roll of four thousand good  pounds a year  he is now up for sale  and will be knocked down to the  bidder who pleases him best  say but the word  and we ll have another  flagon of sack to clinch the bargain       but   said i   if you are indeed owner of this fair property  why  should you descend to so menial an occupation       the jews  the jews  oh most astute and yet most slow witted master  the  ten tribes have been upon me  and i have been harried and wasted  bound   ravished  and despoiled  never was agag  king of amalek  more completely  in the hands of the chosen  and the sole difference is that they have  hewed into pieces mine estate instead of myself       have you lost all  then   reuben asked  open eyed      why no  not all  by no means all   he answered  with a merry laugh   i  have a gold jacobus and a guinea or two in my purse   twill serve for  a flask or so yet  there is my silver hilted rapier  my rings  my gold  snuff box  and my watch by tompion at the sign of the three crowns   it was never bought under a hundred  i ll warrant  then there are such  relics of grandeur as you see upon my person  though they begin to  look as frail and worn as a waiting woman s virtue  in this bag  too   i retain the means for preserving that niceness and elegance of person  which made me  though i say it  as well groomed a man as ever set foot  in st  james s park  here are french scissors  eyebrow brush  toothpick  case  patch box  powder bag  comb  puff  and my pair of red heeled  shoes  what could a man wish for more  these  with a dry throat  a  cheerful heart  and a ready hand  are my whole stock in trade      reuben and i could not forbear from laughing at the curious inventory of  articles which sir gervas had saved from the wreck of his fortunes  he  upon seeing our mirth was so tickled at his own misfortunes  that he  laughed in a high treble key until the whole house resounded with his  merriment   by the mass   he cried at last   i have never had so much  honest amusement out of my prosperity as hath been caused in me by my  downfall  fill up your glasses       we have still some distance to travel this evening  and must not drink  more   i observed  for prudence told me that it was dangerous work for  two sober country lads to keep pace with an experienced toper      so   said he in surprise   i should have thought that would be a   raison de plus   as the french say  but i wish your long legged friend  would come back  even if he were intent upon slitting my weazand for my  attention to the widow  he is not a man to flinch from his liquor  i ll  warrant  curse this wiltshire dust that clings to my periwig       until my comrade returns  sir gervas   said i   you might  since the  subject does not appear to be a painful one to you  let us know how  these evil times  which you bear with such philosophy  came upon you       the old story   he answered  flicking away a few grains of snuff with  his deeply laced cambric handkerchief   the old  old story  my father  a  good  easy country baronet  finding the family purse somewhat full  must  needs carry me up to town to make a man of me  there as a young lad i  was presented at court  and being a slim active youngster with a pert  tongue and assured manner  i caught the notice of the queen  who made  me one of her pages of honour  this post i held until i grew out of  it  when i withdrew from town  but egad  i found i must get back to it  again  for beacham ford park was as dull as a monastery after the life  which i had been living  in town i stayed then with such boon companions  as tommy lawson  my lord halifax  sir jasper lemarck  little geordie  chichester  aye  and old sidney godolphin of the treasury  for with all  his staid ways and long winded budgets he could drain a cup with the  best of us  and was as keen on a main of cocks as on a committee of ways  and means  well  it was rare sport while it lasted  and sink me if  i wouldn t do the same again if i had my time once more  it is like  sliding down a greased plank though  for at first a man goes slow  enough  and thinks he can pull himself up  but presently he goes faster  and faster  until he comes with a crash on to the rocks of ruin at the  bottom       and did you run through four thousand pounds a year   i exclaimed      od s bodikins  man  you speak as if this paltry sum were all the  wealth of the indies  why  from ormonde or buckingham  with their twenty  thousand  down to ranting dicky talbot  there was not one of my set who  could not have bought me out  yet i must have my coach and four  my town  house  my liveried servants  and my stable full of horses  to be in the  mode i must have my poet  and throw him a handful of guineas for his  dedication  well  poor devil  he is one who will miss me  i warrant his  heart was as heavy as his verses when he found me gone  though perchance  he has turned a few guineas by this time by writing a satire upon me   it would have a ready sale among my friends  gad s life  i wonder how  my levees get on  and whom all my suitors have fastened on to now  there  they were morning after morning  the french pimp  the english bully  the  needy man o  letters  the neglected inventor  i never thought to have  got rid of them  but indeed i have shaken them off very effectually now   when the honey pot is broken it is farewell to the flies       and your noble friends   i asked   did none of them stand by you in  your adversity       well  well  i have nought to complain of   exclaimed sir gervas   they  were brave hearted boys for the most part  i might have had their names  on my bills as long as their fingers could hold a pen  but slit me if i  like bleeding my own companions  they might have found a place for me   too  had i consented to play second fiddle where i had been used to lead  the band  i  faith  i care not what i turn my hand to amongst strangers   but i would fain leave my memory sweet in town       as to what you proposed  of serving us as a valet   said i   it is not  to be thought of  we are  in spite of my friend s waggishness  but two  plain blunt countrymen  and have no more need of a valet than one of  those poets which you have spoken of  on the other hand  if you should  care to attach yourself to our party  we shall take you where you  will see service which shall be more to your taste than the curling of  periwigs or the brushing of eyebrows       nay  nay  my friend  speak not with unseemly levity of the mysteries  of the toilet   he cried   ye would yourselves be none the worse for  a touch of mine ivory comb  and a closer acquaintance with the famous  skin purifying wash of murphy which i am myself in the habit of using       i am beholden to you  sir   said reuben   but the famous spring water  wash by providence is quite good enough for the purpose       and dame nature hath placed a wig of her own upon me   i added   which  i should be very loth to change       goths  perfect goths   cried the exquisite  throwing up his white  hands   but here comes a heavy tread and the clink of armour in the  passage   tis our friend the knight of the wrathful countenance  if i  mistake not      it was indeed saxon  who strode into the room to tell us that our horses  were at the door  and that all was ready for our departure  taking  him aside i explained to him in a whisper what had passed between the  stranger and ourselves  with the circumstances which had led me to  suggest that he should join our party  the old soldier frowned at the  news      what have we to do with such a coxcomb   he said   we have hard fare  and harder blows before us  he is not fit for the work       you said yourself that monmouth will be weak in horse   i answered    here is a well appointed cavalier  who is to all appearance a desperate  man and ready for anything  why should we not enrol him       i fear   said saxon   that his body may prove to be like the bran of  a fine cushion  of value only for what it has around it  however  it is  perhaps for the best  the handle to his name may make him welcome in the  camp  for from what i hear there is some dissatisfaction at the way in  which the gentry stand aloof from the enterprise       i had feared   i remarked  still speaking in a whisper   that we were  about to lose one of our party instead of gaining one in this bruton  inn       i have thought better of it   he answered  with a smile   nay  i ll  tell you of it anon  well  sir gervas jerome   he added aloud  turning  to our new associate   i hear that you are coming with us  for a day you  must be content to follow without question or remark  is that agreed       with all my heart   cried sir gervas      then here s a bumper to our better acquaintance   cried saxon  raising  his glass      i pledge ye all   quoth the gallant   here s to a fair fight  and may  the best men win       donnerblitz  man   said saxon   i believe there s mettle in you for all  your gay plumes  i do conceive a liking for you  give me your hand      the soldier of fortune s great brown grip enclosed the delicate hand  of our new friend in a pledge of comradeship  then  having paid our  reckoning and bade a cordial adieu to dame hobson  who glanced methought  somewhat reproachfully or expectantly at saxon  we sprang on our steeds  and continued our journey amidst a crowd of staring villagers  who  huzzaed lustily as we rode out from amongst them         chapter xiv  of the stiff legged parson and his flock    our road lay through castle carey and somerton  which are small towns  lying in the midst of a most beautiful pastoral country  well wooded and  watered by many streams  the valleys along the centre of which the road  lies are rich and luxuriant  sheltered from the winds by long rolling  hills  which are themselves highly cultivated  here and there we passed  the ivy clad turret of an old castle or the peaked gables of a rambling  country house  protruding from amongst the trees and marking the country  seat of some family of repute  more than once  when these mansions were  not far from the road  we were able to perceive the unrepaired dints and  fractures on the walls received during the stormy period of the civil  troubles  fairfax it seems had been down that way  and had left abundant  traces of his visit  i have no doubt that my father would have had much  to say of these signs of puritan wrath had he been riding at our side     the road was crowded with peasants who were travelling in two strong  currents  the one setting from east to west  and the other from west to  east  the latter consisted principally of aged people and of children   who were being sent out of harm s way to reside in the less disturbed  counties until the troubles should be over  many of these poor folk were  pushing barrows in front of them  in which a few bedclothes and some  cracked utensils represented the whole of their worldly goods  others  more prosperous had small carts  drawn by the wild shaggy colts which  are bred on the somerset moors  what with the spirit of the half tamed  beasts and the feebleness of the drivers  accidents were not uncommon   and we passed several unhappy groups who had been tumbled with their  property into a ditch  or who were standing in anxious debate round a  cracked shaft or a broken axle     the countrymen who were making for the west were upon the other hand  men in the prime of life  with little or no baggage  their brown faces   heavy boots  and smockfrocks proclaimed most of them to be mere hinds   though here and there we overtook men who  by their top boots and  corduroys  may have been small farmers or yeomen  these fellows walked  in gangs  and were armed for the most part with stout oak cudgels   which were carried as an aid to their journey  but which in the hands of  powerful men might become formidable weapons  from time to time one  of these travellers would strike up a psalm tune  when all the others  within earshot would join in  until the melody rippled away down the  road  as we passed some scowled angrily at us  while others whispered  together and shook their heads  in evident doubt as to our character and  aims  now and again among the people we marked the tall broad brimmed  hat and geneva mantle which were the badges of the puritan clergy      we are in monmouth s country at last   said saxon to me  for reuben  lockarby and sir gervas jerome had ridden on ahead   this is the raw  material which we shall have to lick into soldiership       and no bad material either   i replied  taking note of the sturdy  figures and bold hearty faces of the men   think ye that they are bound  for monmouth s camp  then       aye  are they  see you yon long limbed parson on the left  him with the  pent house hat  markest thou not the stiffness wherewith he moves his  left leg       why  yes  he is travel worn doubtless       ho  ho   laughed my companion   i have seen such a stiffness before  now  the man hath a straight sword within he leg of his breeches  a  regular parliamentary tuck  i ll warrant  when he is on safe ground he  will produce it  aye  and use it too  but until he is out of all danger  of falling in with the king s horse he is shy of strapping it to his  belt  he is one of the old breed by his cut  who                call fire and sword and desolation              a godly thorough reformation      old samuel hath them to a penstroke  there is another ahead of him  there  with the head of a scythe inside his smock  can you not see the  outline  i warrant there is not one of the rascals but hath a pike head  or sickle blade concealed somewhere about him  i begin to feel the  breath of war once more  and to grow younger with it  hark ye  lad  i am  glad that i did not tarry at the inn       you seemed to be in two minds about it   said i      aye  aye  she was a fine woman  and the quarters were comfortable  i do  not gainsay it  but marriage  d ye see  is a citadel that it is plaguy  easy to find one s way into  but once in old tilly himself could not  bring one out again with credit  i have known such a device on the  danube  where at the first onfall the mamelukes have abandoned the  breach for the very purpose of ensnaring the imperial troops in the  narrow streets beyond  from which few ever returned  old birds are not  caught with such wiles  i did succeed in gaining the ear of one of the  gossips  and asking him what he could tell me of the good dame and her  inn  it seemeth that she is somewhat of a shrew upon occasion  and that  her tongue had more to do with her husband s death than the dropsy which  the leech put it down to  again  a new inn hath been started in the  village  which is well managed  and is like to draw the custom from  her  it is  too  as you have said  a dull sleepy spot  all these reasons  weighed with me  and i decided that it would be best to raise my siege  of the widow  and to retreat whilst i could yet do so with the credit  and honours of war        tis best so   said i   you could not have settled down to a life of  toping and ease  but our new comrade  what think you of him       faith   saxon answered   we shall extend into a troop of horse if we  add to our number every gallant who is in want of a job  as to this sir  gervas  however  i think  as i said at the inn  that he hath more mettle  in him than one would judge at first sight  these young sprigs of the  gentry will always fight  but i doubt if he is hardened enough or  hath constancy enough for such a campaign as this is like to be  his  appearance  too  will be against him in the eyes of the saints  and  though monmouth is a man of easy virtue  the saints are like to have the  chief voice in his councils  now do but look at him as he reins up that  showy grey stallion and gazes back at us  mark his riding hat tilted  over his eye  his open bosom  his whip dangling from his button hole   his hand on his hip  and as many oaths in his mouth as there are ribbons  to his doublet  above all  mark the air with which he looks down upon  the peasants beside him  he will have to change his style if he is to  fight by the side of the fanatics  but hark  i am much mistaken if they  have not already got themselves into trouble      our friends had pulled up their horses to await our coming  they had  scarce halted  however  before the stream of peasants who had been  moving along abreast of them slackened their pace  and gathered round  them with a deep ominous murmur and threatening gestures  other  rustics  seeing that there was something afoot  hurried up to help their  companions  saxon and i put spurs to our horses  and pushing through the  throng  which was becoming every instant larger and more menacing  made  our way to the aid of our friends  who were hemmed in on every side by  the rabble  reuben had laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword  while  sir gervas was placidly chewing his toothpick and looking down at the  angry mob with an air of amused contempt      a flask or two of scent amongst them would not be amiss   he remarked    i would i had a casting bottle       stand on your guard  but do not draw   cried saxon   what the henker  hath come over the chaw bacons  they mean mischief  how now  friends   why this uproar      this question instead of allaying the tumult appeared to make it tenfold  worse  all round us twenty deep were savage faces and angry eyes   with the glint here and there of a weapon half drawn from its place of  concealment  the uproar  which had been a mere hoarse growl  began to  take shape and form   down with the papists   was the cry   down with  the prelatists    smite the erastian butchers    smite the philistine  horsemen    down with them      a stone or two had already whistled past our ears  and we had been  forced in self defence to draw our swords  when the tall minister whom  we had already observed shoved his way through the crowd  and by dint of  his lofty stature and commanding voice prevailed upon them to be silent      how say ye   he asked  turning upon us   fight ye for baal or for the  lord  he who is not with us is against us       which is the side of baal  most reverend sir  and which of the lord    asked sir gervas jerome   methinks if you were to speak plain english  instead of hebrew we might come to an understanding sooner       this is no time for light words   the minister cried  with a flush of  anger upon his face   if ye would keep your skins whole  tell me  are ye  for the bloody usurper james stuart  or are ye for his most protestant  majesty king monmouth       what  he hath come to the title already   exclaimed saxon   know then  that we are four unworthy vessels upon our way to offer our services to  the protestant cause       he lies  good master pettigrue  he lies most foully   shouted a burly  fellow from the edge of the crowd   who ever saw a good protestant in  such a punchinello dress as yonder  is not amalekite written upon his  raiment  is he not attired as becometh the bridegroom of the harlot of  rome  why then should we not smite him       i thank you  my worthy friend   said sir gervas  whose attire had moved  this champion s wrath   if i were nearer i should give you some return  for the notice which you have taken of me       what proof have we that ye are not in the pay of the usurper  and on  your way to oppress the faithful   asked the puritan divine      i tell you  man   said saxon impatiently   that we have travelled all  the way from hampshire to fight against james stuart  we will ride with  ye to monmouth s camp  and what better proof could ye desire than that       it may be that ye do but seek an opportunity of escaping from our  bondage   the minister observed  after conferring with one or two of the  leading peasants   it is our opinion  therefore  that before coming  with us ye must deliver unto us your swords  pistols  and other carnal  weapons       nay  good sir  that cannot be   our leader answered   a cavalier may  not with honour surrender his blade or his liberty in the manner ye  demand  keep close to my bridle arm  clarke  and strike home at any  rogue who lays hands on you      a hum of anger rose from the crowd  and a score of sticks and  scythe blades were raised against us  when the minister again interposed  and silenced his noisy following      did i hear aright   he asked   is your name clarke       it is   i answered      your christian name       micah       living at       havant      the clergyman conferred for a few moments with a grizzly bearded   harsh faced man dressed in black buckram who stood at his elbow      if you are really micah clarke of havant   quoth he   you will be able  to tell us the name of an old soldier  skilled in the german wars  who  was to have come with ye to the camp of the faithful       why  this is he   i answered   decimus saxon is his name       aye  aye  master pettigrue   cried the old man   the very name given by  dicky rumbold  he said that either the old roundhead clarke or his son  would go with him  but who are these       this is master reuben lockarby  also of havant  and sir gervas jerome  of surrey   i replied   they are both here as volunteers desiring to  serve under the duke of monmouth       right glad i am to see ye  then   said the stalwart minister heartily    friends  i can answer for these gentlemen that they favour the honest  folk and the old cause      at these words the rage of the mob turned in an instant into the most  extravagant adulation and delight  they crowded round us  patting our  riding boots  pulling at the skirts of our dress  pressing our hands and  calling down blessings upon our heads  until their pastor succeeded  at last in rescuing us from their attentions and in persuading them to  resume their journey  we walked our horses in the midst of them whilst  the clergyman strode along betwixt saxon and myself  he was  as reuben  remarked  well fitted to be an intermediary between us  for he was  taller though not so broad as i was  and broader though not so tall as  the adventurer  his face was long  thin  and hollow cheeked  with a pair  of great thatched eyebrows and deep sunken melancholy eyes  which lit up  upon occasion with a sudden quick flash of fiery enthusiasm      joshua pettigrue is my name  gentlemen   said he   i am an unworthy  worker in the lord s vineyard  testifying with voice and with arm to his  holy covenant  these are my faithful flock  whom i am bringing westward  that they may be ready for the reaping when it pleases the almighty to  gather them in       and why have you not brought them into some show of order or  formation   asked saxon   they are straggling along the road like a line  of geese upon a common when michaelmas is nigh  have you no fears  is  it not written that your calamity cometh suddenly  suddenly shall you be  broken down without remedy       aye  friend  but is it not also written   trust in the lord with all  thine heart  and lean not unto thine own understanding   mark ye  if i  were to draw up my men in military fashion it would invite attention and  attack from any of james stuart s horse who may come our way  it is my  desire to bring my flock to the camp and obtain pieces for them before  exposing them to so unequal a contest       truly  sir  it is a wise resolution   said saxon grimly   for if a  troop of horse came down upon these good people the pastor would find  himself without his flock       nay  that could never be   cried master pettigrue with fervour   say  rather that pastor  flock  and all would find their way along the thorny  track of martyrdom to the new jerusalem  know  friend  that i have come  from monmouth in order to conduct these men to his standard  i received  from him  or rather from master ferguson  instructions to be on the  lookout for ye and for several others of the faithful we expect to join  us from the east  by what route came ye       over salisbury plain and so through bruton       and saw ye or met ye any of our people upon the way       none   saxon answered   we left the blue guards at salisbury  however   and we saw either them or some other horse regiment near this side of  the plain at the village of mere       ah  there is a gathering of the eagles   cried master joshua pettigrue   shaking his head   they are men of fine raiment  with war horses and  chariots and trappings  like the assyrians of old  yet shall the angel  of the lord breathe upon them in the night  yea  he shall cut them off  utterly in his wrath  and they shall be destroyed       amen  amen   cried as many of the peasants as were within earshot      they have elevated their horn  master pettigrue   said the  grizzly haired puritan   they have set up their candlestick on high  the  candlestick of a perverse ritual and of an idolatrous service  shall it  not be dashed down by the hands of the righteous       lo  this same candle waxed big and burned sooty  even as an offence to  the nostrils  in the days of our fathers   cried a burly red faced man   whose dress proclaimed him to be one of the yeoman class   so was it  when old noll did get his snuffing shears to work upon it  it is a wick  which can only be trimmed by the sword of the faithful   a grim laugh  from the whole party proclaimed their appreciation of the pious waggery  of their companion      ah  brother sandcroft   cried the pastor   there is much sweetness and  manna hidden in thy conversation  but the way is long and dreary  shall  we not lighten it by a song of praise  where is brother thistlethwaite   whose voice is as the cymbal  the tabor  and the dulcimer       lo  most pious master pettigrue   said saxon   i have myself at times  ventured to lift up my voice before the lord   without any further  apology he broke out in stentorian tones into the following hymn  the  refrain of which was caught up by pastor and congregation               the lord he is a morion             that guards me from all wound             the lord he is a coat of mail             that circles me all round             who then fears to draw the sword              and fight the battle of the lord               the lord he is the buckler true             that swings on my left arm             the lord he is the plate of proof             that shieldeth me from harm             who then fears to draw the sword              and fight the battle of the lord               who then dreads the violent              or fears the man of pride             or shall i flee from two or three             if he be by my side             who then fears to draw the sword              and fight the battle of the lord               my faith is like a citadel             girt round with moat and wall             no mine  or sap  or breach  or gap             can ere prevail at all             who then fears to draw the sword              and fight the battle of the lord     saxon ceased  but the reverend joshua pettigrue waved his long arms and  repeated the refrain  which was taken up again and again by the long  column of marching peasants      it is a godly hymn   said our companion  who had  to my disgust and  to the evident astonishment of reuben and sir gervas  resumed the  snuffling  whining voice which he had used in the presence of my father    it hath availed much on the field of battle       truly   returned the clergyman   if your comrades are of as sweet  a savour as yourself  ye will be worth a brigade of pikes to the  faithful   a sentiment which raised a murmur of assent from the puritans  around   since  sir   he continued   you have had much experience in the  wiles of war  i shall be glad to hand over to you the command of this  small body of the faithful  until such time as we reach the army       it is time  too  in good faith  that ye had a soldier at your head    decimus saxon answered quietly   my eyes deceive me strangely if i  do not see the gleam of sword and cuirass upon the brow of yonder  declivity  methinks our pious exercises have brought the enemy upon us          chapter xv  of our brush with the king s dragoons    some little distance from us a branch road ran into that along which we  and our motley assemblage of companions in arms were travelling  this  road curved down the side of a well wooded hill  and then over the level  for a quarter of a mile or so before opening on the other  just at the  brow of the rising ground there stood a thick bristle of trees  amid the  trunks of which there came and went a bright shimmer of sparkling steel   which proclaimed the presence of armed men  farther back  where the road  took a sudden turn and ran along the ridge of the hill  several horsemen  could be plainly seen outlined against the evening sky  so peaceful   however  was the long sweep of countryside  mellowed by the golden light  of the setting sun  with a score of village steeples and manor houses  peeping out from amongst the woods  that it was hard to think that the  thundercloud of war was really lowering over that fair valley  and that  at any instant the lightning might break from it     the country folk  however  appeared to have no difficulty at all in  understanding the danger to which they were exposed  the fugitives from  the west gave a yell of consternation  and ran wildly down the road or  whipped up their beasts of burden in the endeavour to place as safe a  distance as possible between themselves and the threatened attack  the  chorus of shrill cries and shouts  with the cracking of whips  creaking  of wheels  and the occasional crash when some cart load of goods came to  grief  made up a most deafening uproar  above which our leader s voice  resounded in sharp  eager exhortation and command  when  however  the  loud brazen shriek from a bugle broke from the wood  and the head of  a troop of horse began to descend the slope  the panic became greater  still  and it was difficult for us to preserve any order at all amidst  the wild rush of the terrified fugitives      stop that cart  clarke   cried saxon vehemently  pointing with his  sword to an old waggon  piled high with furniture and bedding  which was  lumbering along drawn by two raw boned colts  at the same moment i saw  him drive his horse into the crowd and catch at the reins of another  similar one     giving covenant s bridle a shake i was soon abreast of the cart which  he had indicated  and managed to bring the furious young horses to a  stand still      bring it up   cried our leader  working with the coolness which only a  long apprenticeship to war can give   now  friends  cut the traces    a dozen knives were at work in a moment  and the kicking  struggling  animals scampered off  leaving their burdens behind them  saxon sprang  off his horse and set the example in dragging the waggon across the  roadway  while some of the peasants  under the direction of reuben  lockarby and of master joshua pettigrue  arranged a couple of other  carts to block the way fifty yards further down  the latter precaution  was to guard against the chance of the royal horse riding through  the fields and attacking us from behind  so speedily was the scheme  conceived and carried out  that within a very few minutes of the first  alarm we found ourselves protected front and rear by a lofty barricade   while within this improvised fortress was a garrison of a hundred and  fifty men      what firearms have we amongst us   asked saxon hurriedly      a dozen pistols at the most   replied the elderly puritan  who was  addressed by his companions as hope above williams   john rodway   the coachman  hath his blunderbuss  there are also two godly men from  hungerford  who are keepers of game  and who have brought their pieces  with them       they are here  sir   cried another  pointing to two stout  bearded  fellows  who were ramming charges into their long barrelled muskets    their names are wat and nat millman       two who can hit their mark are worth a battalion who shoot wide   our  leader remarked   get under the waggon  my friends  and rest your pieces  upon the spokes  never draw trigger until the sons of belial are within  three pikes  length of ye       my brother and i   quoth one of them   can hit a running doe at two  hundred paces  our lives are in the hands of the lord  but two  at  least  of these hired butchers we shall send before us       as gladly as ever we slew stoat or wild cat   cried the other  slipping  under the waggon   we are keeping the lord s preserves now  brother wat   and truly these are some of the vermin that infest them       let all who have pistols line the waggon   said saxon  tying his mare  to the hedge  an example which we all followed   clarke  do you take  charge upon the right with sir gervas  while lockarby assists master  pettigrue upon the left  ye others shall stand behind with stones   should they break through our barricades  slash at the horses with your  scythes  once down  the riders are no match for ye      a low sullen murmur of determined resolution rose from the peasants   mingled with pious ejaculations and little scraps of hymn or of prayer   they had all produced from under their smocks rustic weapons of some  sort  ten or twelve had petronels  which  from their antique look and  rusty condition  threatened to be more dangerous to their possessors  than to the enemy  others had sickles  scythe blades  flails   half pikes  or hammers  while the remainder carried long knives and  oaken clubs  simple as were these weapons  history has proved that in  the hands of men who are deeply stirred by religious fanaticism they are  by no means to be despised  one had but to look at the stern  set faces  of our followers  and the gleam of exultation and expectancy which shone  from their eyes  to see that they were not the men to quail  either from  superior numbers or equipment      by the mass   whispered sir gervas   it is magnificent  an hour of this  is worth a year in the mall  the old puritan bull is fairly at bay  let  us see what sort of sport the bull pups make in the baiting of him  i ll  lay five pieces to four on the chaw bacons       nay  it s no matter for idle betting   said i shortly  for his  light hearted chatter annoyed me at so solemn a moment      five to four on the soldiers  then   he persisted   it is too good a  match not to have a stake on it one way or the other       our lives are the stake   said i      faith  i had forgot it   he replied  still mumbling his toothpick    to  be or not to be   as will of stratford says  kynaston was great on the  passage  but here is the bell that rings the curtain up      whilst we had been making our dispositions the troop of horse  for there  appeared to be but one  had trotted down the cross road  and had drawn  up across the main highway  they numbered  as far as i could judge   about ninety troopers  and it was evident from their three cornered  hats  steel plates  red sleeves  and bandoliers  that they were dragoons  of the regular army  the main body halted a quarter of a mile from us   while three officers rode to the front and held a short consultation   which ended in one of them setting spurs to his horse and cantering down  in our direction  a bugler followed a few paces behind him  waving a  white kerchief and blowing an occasional blast upon his trumpet      here comes an envoy   cried saxon  who was standing up in the waggon    now  my brethren  we have neither kettle drum nor tinkling brass  but  we have the instrument wherewith providence hath endowed us  let us show  the redcoats that we know how to use it                who then dreads the violent              or fears the man of pride              or shall i flee from two or three             if he be by my side       seven score voices broke in  in a hoarse roar  upon the chorus                 who then fears to draw the sword              and fight the battle of the lord      i could well believe at that moment that the spartans had found the lame  singer tyrtaeus the most successful of their generals  for the sound of  their own voices increased the confidence of the country folk  while the  martial words of the old hymn roused the dogged spirit in their breasts   so high did their courage run that they broke off their song with a  loud warlike shout  waving their weapons above their heads  and ready i  verily believe to march out from their barricades and make straight for  the horsemen  in the midst of this clamour and turmoil the young dragoon  officer  a handsome  olive faced lad  rode fearlessly up to the barrier   and pulling up his beautiful roan steed  held up his hand with an  imperious gesture which demanded silence      who is the leader of this conventicle   he asked      address your message to me  sir   said our leader from the top of  the waggon   but understand that your white flag will only protect you  whilst you use such language as may come from one courteous adversary to  another  say your say or retire       courtesy and honour   said the officer  with a sneer   are not extended  to rebels who are in arms against their lawful sovereign  if you are the  leader of this rabble  i warn you if they are not dispersed within five  minutes by this watch   he pulled out an elegant gold time piece   we  shall ride down upon them and cut them to pieces       the lord can protect his own   saxon answered  amid a fierce hum of  approval from the crowd   is this all thy message       it is all  and you will find it enough  you presbyterian traitor    cried the dragoon cornet   listen to me  misguided fools   he continued   standing up upon his stirrups and speaking to the peasants at the  other side of the waggon   what chance have ye with your whittles and  cheese scrapers  ye may yet save your skins if ye will but deliver up  your leaders  throw down what ye are pleased to call your arms  and  trust to the king s mercy       this exceedeth the limitations of your privileges   said saxon  drawing  a pistol from his belt and cocking it   if you say another word to  seduce these people from their allegiance  i fire       hope not to benefit monmouth   cried the young officer  disregarding  the threat  and still addressing his words to the peasants   the whole  royal army is drawing round him and        have a care   shouted our leader  in a deep harsh voice      his head within a month shall roll upon the scaffold       but you shall never live to see it   said saxon  and stooping over  he fired straight at the cornet s head  at the flash of the pistol the  trumpeter wheeled round and galloped for his life  while the roan horse  turned and followed with its master still seated firmly in the saddle      verily you have missed the midianite   cried hope above williams      he is dead   said our leader  pouring a fresh charge into his pistol    it is the law of war  clarke   he added  looking round at me   he hath  chosen to break it  and must pay forfeit      as he spoke i saw the young officer lean gradually over in his saddle   until  when about half way back to his friends  he lost his balance and  fell heavily in the roadway  turning over two or three times with  the force of his fall  and lying at last still and motionless  a  dust coloured heap  a loud yell of rage broke from the troopers at  the sight  which was answered by a shout of defiance from the puritan  peasantry      down on your faces   cried saxon   they are about to fire      the crackle of musketry and a storm of bullets  pinging on the hard  ground  or cutting twigs from the hedges on either side of us  lent  emphasis to our leader s order  many of the peasants crouched behind the  feather beds and tables which had been pulled out of the cart  some lay  in the waggon itself  and some sheltered themselves behind or underneath  it  others again lined the ditches on either side or lay flat upon the  roadway  while a few showed their belief in the workings of providence  by standing upright without flinching from the bullets  amongst these  latter were saxon and sir gervas  the former to set an example to his  raw troops  and the latter out of pure laziness and indifference   reuben and i sat together in the ditch  and i can assure you  my dear  grandchildren  that we felt very much inclined to bob our heads when we  heard the bullets piping all around them  if any soldier ever told you  that he did not the first time that he was under fire  then that soldier  is not a man to trust  after sitting rigid and silent  however  as if  we had both stiff necks  for a very few minutes  the feeling passed  completely away  and from that day to this it has never returned to me   you see familiarity breeds contempt with bullets as with other things   and though it is no easy matter to come to like them  like the king of  sweden or my lord cutts  it is not so very hard to become indifferent to  them     the cornet s death did not remain long unavenged  a little old man with  a sickle  who had been standing near sir gervas  gave a sudden sharp  cry  and springing up into the air with a loud  glory to god   fell flat  upon his face dead  a bullet had struck him just over the right eye   almost at the same moment one of the peasants in the waggon was shot  through the chest  and sat up coughing blood all over the wheel  i saw  master joshua pettigrue catch him in his long arms  and settle some  bedding under his head  so that he lay breathing heavily and pattering  forth prayers  the minister showed himself a man that day  for amid the  fierce carbine fire he walked boldly up and down  with a drawn rapier in  his left hand  for he was a left handed man  and his bible in the other    this is what you are dying for  dear brothers   he cried continually   holding the brown volume up in the air   are ye not ready to die for  this   and every time he asked the question a low eager murmur of assent  rose from the ditches  the waggon  and the road      they aim like yokels at a wappenschaw   said saxon  seating himself  on the side of the waggon   like all young soldiers they fire too high   when i was an adjutant it was my custom to press down the barrels of the  muskets until my eye told me that they were level  these rogues think  that they have done their part if they do but let the gun off  though  they are as like to hit the plovers above us as ourselves       five of the faithful have fallen   said hope above williams   shall we  not sally forth and do battle with the children of antichrist  are we to  lie here like so many popinjays at a fair for the troopers to practise  upon       there is a stone barn over yonder on the hill side   i remarked   if  we who have horses  and a few others  were to keep the dragoons in  play  the people might be able to reach it  and so be sheltered from the  fire       at least let my brother and me have a shot or two back at them   cried  one of the marksmen beside the wheel     to all our entreaties and suggestions  however  our leader only replied  by a shake of the head  and continued to swing his long legs over the  side of the waggon with his eyes fixed intently upon the horsemen  many  of whom had dismounted and were leaning their carbines over the cruppers  of their chargers      this cannot go on  sir   said the pastor  in a low earnest voice   two  more men have just been hit       if fifty more men are hit we must wait until they charge   saxon  answered   what would you do  man  if you leave this shelter you will  be cut off and utterly destroyed  when you have seen as much of war as  i have done  you will learn to put up quietly with what is not to be  avoided  i remember on such another occasion when the rearguard or  nachhut of the imperial troops was followed by croats  who were in  the pay of the grand turk  i lost half my company before the mercenary  renegades came to close fighting  ha  my brave boys  they are mounting   we shall not have to wait long now      the dragoons were indeed climbing into their saddles again  and forming  across the road  with the evident intention of charging down upon us   at the same time about thirty men detached themselves from the main body  and trotted away into the fields upon our right  saxon growled a hearty  oath under his breath as he observed them      they have some knowledge of warfare after all   said he   they mean to  charge us flank and front  master joshua  see that your scythesmen  line the quickset hedge upon the right  stand well up  my brothers  and  flinch not from the horses  you men with the sickles  lie in the ditch  there  and cut at the legs of the brutes  a line of stone throwers  behind that  a heavy stone is as sure as a bullet at close quarters  if  ye would see your wives and children again  make that hedge good against  the horsemen  now for the front attack  let the men who carry petronels  come into the waggon  two of yours  clarke  and two of yours  lockarby   i can spare one also  that makes five  now here are ten others of a sort  and three muskets  twenty shots in all  have you no pistols  sir gervas      no  but i can get a pair   said our companion  and springing upon his  horse he forced his way through the ditch  past the barrier  and so down  the road in the direction of the dragoons     the movement was so sudden and so unexpected that there was a dead  silence for a few seconds  which was broken by a general howl of hatred  and execration from the peasants   shoot upon him  shoot down the false  amalekite   they shrieked   he hath gone to join his kind  he hath  delivered us up into the hands of the enemy  judas  judas   as to the  horsemen  who were still forming up for a charge and waiting for the  flanking party to get into position  they sat still and silent  not  knowing what to make of the gaily dressed cavalier who was speeding  towards them     we were not left long in doubt  however  he had no sooner reached the  spot where the cornet had fallen than he sprang from his horse and  helped himself to the dead man s pistols  and to the belt which  contained his powder and ball  mounting at his leisure  amid a shower of  bullets which puffed up the white dust all around him  he rode onwards  towards the dragoons and discharged one of his pistols at them  wheeling  round he politely raised his cap  and galloped back to us  none the  worse for his adventure  though a ball had grazed his horse s fetlock  and another had left a hole in the skirt of his riding coat  the  peasants raised a shout of jubilation as he rode in  and from that day  forward our friend was permitted to wear his gay trappings and to bear  himself as he would  without being suspected of having mounted the  livery of satan or of being wanting in zeal for the cause of the saints      they are coming   cried saxon   let no man draw trigger until he sees  me shoot  if any does  i shall send a bullet through him  though it was  my last shot and the troopers were amongst us      as our leader uttered this threat and looked grimly round upon us with  an evident intention of executing it  a shrill blare of a bugle burst  from the horsemen in front of us  and was answered by those upon our  flank  at the signal both bodies set spurs to their horses and dashed  down upon us at the top of their speed  those in the field were delayed  for a few moments  and thrown into some disorder  by finding that the  ground immediately in front of them was soft and boggy  but having  made their way through it they re formed upon the other side and rode  gallantly at the hedge  our own opponents  having a clear course before  them  never slackened for an instant  but came thundering down with a  jingling of harness and a tempest of oaths upon our rude barricades     ah  my children  when a man in his age tries to describe such things as  these  and to make others see what he has seen  it is only then that he  understands what a small stock of language a plain man keeps by him for  his ordinary use in the world  and how unfit it is to meet any call  upon it  for though at this very moment i can myself see that white  somersetshire road  with the wild whirling charge of the horsemen  the  red angry faces of the men  and the gaping nostrils of the horses all  wreathed and framed in clouds of dust  i cannot hope to make it clear  to your young eyes  which never have looked  and  i trust  never shall  look  upon such a scene  when  too  i think of the sound  a mere rattle  and jingle at first  but growing in strength and volume with every step   until it came upon us with a thunderous rush and roar which gave the  impression of irresistible power  i feel that that too is beyond the  power of my feeble words to express  to inexperienced soldiers like  ourselves it seemed impossible that our frail defence and our feeble  weapons could check for an instant the impetus and weight of the  dragoons  to right and left i saw white set faces  open eyed and rigid   unflinching  with a stubbornness which rose less from hope than from  despair  all round rose exclamations and prayers   lord  save thy  people    mercy  lord  mercy    be with us this day    receive our  souls  o merciful father   saxon lay across the waggon with his eyes  glinting like diamonds and his petronel presented at the full length  of his rigid arm  following his example we all took aim as steadily as  possible at the first rank of the enemy  our only hope of safety lay  in making that one discharge so deadly that our opponents should be too  much shaken to continue their attack     would the man never fire  they could not be more than ten paces from us   i could see the buckles of the men s plates and the powder charges in  their bandoliers  one more stride yet  and at last our leader s pistol  flashed and we poured in a close volley  supported by a shower of heavy  stones from the sturdy peasants behind  i could hear them splintering  against casque and cuirass like hail upon a casement  the cloud of smoke  veiling for an instant the line of galloping steeds and gallant riders  drifted slowly aside to show a very different scene  a dozen men and  horses were rolling in one wild blood spurting heap  the unwounded  falling over those whom our balls and stones had brought down   struggling  snorting chargers  iron shod feet  staggering figures rising  and falling  wild  hatless  bewildered men half stunned by a fall  and  not knowing which way to turn  that was the foreground of the picture   while behind them the remainder of the troop were riding furiously back   wounded and hale  all driven by the one desire of getting to a place of  safety where they might rally their shattered formation  a great shout  of praise and thanksgiving rose from the delighted peasants  and  surging over the barricade they struck down or secured the few uninjured  troopers who had boon unable or unwilling to join their companions in  their flight  the carbines  swords  and bandoliers were eagerly pounced  upon by the victors  some of whom had served in the militia  and knew  well how to handle the weapons which they had won     the victory  however  was by no means completed  the flanking squadron  had ridden boldly at the hedge  and a dozen or more had forced their way  through  in spite of the showers of stones and the desperate thrusts of  the pikemen and scythemen  once amongst the peasants  the long swords  and the armour of the dragoons gave them a great advantage  and though  the sickles brought several of the horses to the ground the soldiers  continued to lay about them freely  and to beat back the fierce but  ill armed resistance of their opponents  a dragoon sergeant  a man of  great resolution and of prodigious strength  appeared to be the leader  of the party  and encouraged his followers both by word and example   a stab from a half pike brought his horse to the ground  but he  sprang from the saddle as it fell  and avenged its death by a sweeping  back handed cut from his broadsword  waving his hat in his left hand he  continued to rally his men  and to strike down every puritan who came  against him  until a blow from a hatchet brought him on his knees and  a flail stroke broke his sword close by the hilt  at the fall of their  leader his comrades turned and fled through the hedge  but the gallant  fellow  wounded and bleeding  still showed fight  and would assuredly  have been knocked upon the head for his pains had i not picked him up  and thrown him into the waggon  where he had the good sense to lie quiet  until the skirmish was at an end  of the dozen who broke through  not  more than four escaped  and several others lay dead or wounded upon the  other side of the hedge  impaled by scythe blades or knocked off  their horses by stones  altogether nine of the dragoons were slain  and fourteen wounded  while we retained seven unscathed prisoners  ten  horses fit for service  and a score or so of carbines  with good store  of match  powder  and ball  the remainder of the troop fired a  single  straggling  irregular volley  and then galloped away down the  cross road  disappearing amongst the trees from which they had emerged     all this  however  had not been accomplished without severe loss upon  our side  three men had been killed and six wounded  one of them  very seriously  by the musketry fire  five had been cut down when  the flanking party broke their way in  and only one of these could be  expected to recover  in addition to this  one man had lost his life  through the bursting of an ancient petronel  and another had his arm  broken by the kick of a horse  our total losses  therefore  were eight  killed and the same wounded  which could not but be regarded as a very  moderate number when we consider the fierceness of the skirmish  and the  superiority of our enemy both in discipline and in equipment     so elated were the peasants by their victory  that those who had secured  horses were clamorous to be allowed to follow the dragoons  the more so  as sir gervas jerome and reuben were both eager to lead them  decimus  saxon refused  however  to listen to any such scheme  nor did he show  more favour to the reverend joshua pettigrue s proposal  that he should  in his capacity as pastor mount immediately upon the waggon  and improve  the occasion by a few words of healing and unction      it is true  good master pettigrue  that we owe much praise and much  outpouring  and much sweet and holy contending  for this blessing which  hath come upon israel   said he   but the time hath not yet arrived   there is an hour for prayer and an hour for labour  hark ye  friend   to  one of the prisoners   to what regiment do you belong       it is not for me to reply to your questions   the man answered sulkily     nay  then  we ll try if a string round your scalp and a few twists of a  drumstick will make you find your tongue   said saxon  pushing his face  up to that of the prisoner  and staring into his eyes with so savage an  expression that the man shrank away affrighted      it is a troop of the second dragoon regiment   he said      where is the regiment itself       we left it on the ilchester and langport road       you hear   said our leader   we have not a moment to spare  or we may  have the whole crew about our ears  put our dead and wounded in the  carts  and we can harness two of these chargers to them  we shall not be  in safety until we are in taunton town      even master joshua saw that the matter was too pressing to permit of  any spiritual exercises  the wounded men were lifted into the waggon and  laid upon the bedding  while our dead were placed in the cart which had  defended our rear  the peasants who owned these  far from making any  objection to this disposal of their property  assisted us in every way   tightening girths and buckling traces  within an hour of the ending of  the skirmish we found ourselves pursuing our way once more  and looking  back through the twilight at the scattered black dots upon the white  road  where the bodies of the dragoons marked the scene of our victory           chapter xvi  of our coming to taunton    the purple shadows of evening had fallen over the countryside  and the  sun had sunk behind the distant quantock and brendon hills  as our rude  column of rustic infantry plodded through curry rivell  wrantage  and  henlade  at every wayside cottage and red tiled farmhouse the people  swarmed out us we passed  with jugs full of milk or beer  shaking hands  with our yokels  and pressing food and drink upon them  in the little  villages old and young came buzzing to greet us  and cheered long and  loud for king monmouth and the protestant cause  the stay at homes were  mostly elderly folks and children  but here and there a young labourer   whom hesitation or duties had kept back  was so carried away by our  martial appearance  and by the visible trophies of our victory  that he  snatched up a weapon and joined our ranks     the skirmish had reduced our numbers  but it had done much to turn our  rabble of peasants into a real military force  the leadership of saxon   and his stern  short words of praise or of censure had done even more   the men kept some sort of formation  and stepped together briskly in a  compact body  the old soldier and i rode at the head of the column  with  master pettigrue still walking between us  then came the cartful of  our dead  whom we were carrying with us to insure their decent burial   behind this walked two score of scythe and sickle men  with their rude  weapons over their shoulders  preceding the waggon in which the wounded  were carried  this was followed by the main body of the peasants   and the rear was brought up by ten or twelve men under the command of  lockarby and sir gervas  mounted upon captured chargers  and wearing the  breastplates  swords  and carbines of the dragoons     i observed that saxon rode with his chin upon his shoulder  casting  continual uneasy glances behind him  and halting at every piece of  rising ground to make sure that there were no pursuers at our heels  it  was not until  after many weary miles of marching  the lights of taunton  could be seen twinkling far off in the valley beneath us that he at last  heaved a deep sigh of relief  and expressed his belief that all danger  was over      i am not prone to be fearful upon small occasion   he remarked   but  hampered as we are with wounded men and prisoners  it might have puzzled  petrinus himself to know what we should have done had the cavalry  overtaken us  i can now  master pettigrue  smoke my pipe in peace   without pricking up my ears at every chance rumble of a wheel or shout  of a village roisterer       even had they pursued us   said the minister stoutly   as long as the  hand of the lord shall shield us  why should we fear them       aye  aye   saxon answered impatiently   but the devil prevaileth at  times  were not the chosen people themselves overthrown and led into  captivity  how say you  clarke       one such skirmish is enough for a day   i remarked   faith  if instead  of charging us they had continued that carbine fire  we must either have  come forth or been shot where we lay       for that reason i forbade our friends with the muskets to answer it    said saxon   our silence led them to think that we had but a pistol or  two among us  and so brought them to charge us  thus our volley became  the more terrifying since it was unexpected  i ll wager there was not a  man amongst them who did not feel that he had been led into a trap  mark  you how the rogues wheeled and fled with one accord  as though it had  been part of their daily drill       the peasants stood to it like men   i remarked      there is nothing like a tincture of calvinism for stiffening a line of  battle   said saxon   look at the swede when he is at home  what more  honest  simple hearted fellow could you find  with no single soldierly  virtue  save that he could put away more spruce beer than you would care  to pay for  yet if you do but cram him with a few strong  homely texts   place a pike in his hand  and give him a gustavus to lead him  there is  no infantry in the world that can stand against him  on the other hand   i have seen young turks  untrained to arms  strike in on behalf of the  koran as lustily as these brave fellows behind us did for the bible  which master pettigrue held up in front of them       i trust  sir   said the minister gravely   that you do not  by  these remarks  intend to institute any comparison between our sacred  scriptures and the writings of the impostor mahomet  or to infer that  there is any similarity between the devil inspired fury of the infidel  saracens and the christian fortitude of the struggling faithful       by no means   saxon answered  grinning at me over the minister s head    i was but showing how closely the evil one can imitate the workings of  the spirit       too true  master saxon  too true   the clergyman answered sadly   amid  the conflict and discord it is hard to pick out the true path  but  i marvel much that amidst the snares and temptations that beset a  soldier s life you have kept yourself unsullied  with your heart still  set upon the true faith       it was through no strength of mine own   said saxon piously      in very truth  such men as you are much needed in monmouth s army    master joshua exclaimed   they have there several  as i understand  from  holland  brandenburg  and scotland  who have been trained in arms  but  who care so little for the cause which we uphold that they curse and  swear in a manner that affrights the peasants  and threatens to call  down a judgment upon the army  others there are who cling close to the  true faith  and have been born again among the righteous  but alas  they  have had no experience of camps and fields  our blessed master can work  by means of weak instruments  yet the fact remains that a man may be  a chosen light in a pulpit  and yet be of little avail in an onslaught  such as we have seen this day  i can myself arrange my discourse to the  satisfaction of my flock  so that they grieve when the sand is run out    note e  appendix  but i am aware that this power would stand me in  little stead when it came to the raising of barricades and the use of  carnal weapons  in this way it comes about  in the army of the faithful   that those who are fit to lead are hateful to the people  while those to  whose words the people will hearken know little of war  now we have this  day seen that you are ready of head and of hand  of much experience of  battle  and yet of demure and sober life  full of yearnings after the  word  and strivings against apollyon  i therefore repeat that you shall  be as a very joshua amongst them  or as a samson  destined to tear  down the twin pillars of prelacy and popery  so as to bury this corrupt  government in its fall      decimus saxon s only reply to this eulogy was one of those groans which  were supposed  among the zealots  to be the symbol of intense inner  conflict and emotion  so austere and holy was his expression  so solemn  his demeanour  and so frequent the upturnings of his eyes  clasping  of his hands  and other signs which marked the extreme sectary  that  i could not but marvel at the depths and completeness of the hypocrisy  which had cast so complete a cloak over his rapacious self  for very  mischief s sake i could not refrain from reminding him that there was  one at least who valued his professions at their real value      have you told the worthy minister   said i   of your captivity amongst  the mussulmans  and of the noble way in which you did uphold the  christian faith at stamboul       nay   cried our companion   i would fain hear the tale  i marvel much  that one so faithful and unbending as thyself was ever let loose by the  unclean and bloodthirsty followers of mahomet       it does not become me to tell the tale   saxon answered with great  presence of mind  casting at the same time a most venomous sidelong  glance at me   it is for my comrades in misfortune and not for me to  describe what i endured for the faith  i have little doubt  master  pettigrue  that you would have done as much had you been there  the town  of taunton lies very quiet beneath us  and there are few lights for so  early an hour  seeing that it has not yet gone ten  it is clear that  monmouth s forces have not reached it yet  else had there been some show  of camp fires in the valley  for though it is warm enough to lie out in  the open  the men must have fires to cook their victual       the army could scarce have come so far   said the pastor   they have   i hear  been much delayed by the want of arms and by the need of  discipline  bethink ye  it was on the eleventh day of the month that  monmouth landed at lyme  and it is now but the night of the fourteenth   there was much to be done in the time       four whole days   growled the old soldier   yet i expected no better   seeing that they have  so far as i can hear  no tried soldiers amongst  them  by my sword  tilly or wallenstein would not have taken four days  to come from lyme to taunton  though all james stuart s cavalry barred  the way  great enterprises are not pushed through in this halting  fashion  the blow should be sharp and sudden  but tell me  worthy sir   all that you know about the matter  for we have heard little upon the  road save rumour and surmise  was there not some fashion of onfall at  bridport       there was indeed some shedding of blood at that place  the first two  days were consumed  as i understand  in the enrolling of the faithful  and the search for arms wherewith to equip them  you may well shake your  head  for the hours were precious  at last five hundred men were broken  into some sort of order  and marched along the coast under command of  lord grey of wark and wade the lawyer  at bridport they were opposed  by the red dorset militia and part of portman s yellow coats  if all  be true that is said  neither side had much to boast of  grey and his  cavalry never tightened bridle until they were back in lyme once more   though it is said their flight had more to do with the hard mouths  of their horses than with the soft hearts of the riders  wade and his  footmen did bravely  and had the best of it against the king s troops   there was much outcry against grey in the camp  but monmouth can  scarce afford to be severe upon the only nobleman who hath joined his  standard       pshaw   cried saxon peevishly   there was no great stock of noblemen in  cromwell s army  i trow  and yet they held their own against the king   who had as many lords by him as there are haws in a thicket  if ye have  the people on your side  why should ye crave for these bewigged fine  gentlemen  whose white hands and delicate rapiers are of as much service  as so many ladies  bodkins       faith   said i   if all the fops are as careless for their lives as our  friend sir gervas  i could wish no better comrades in the field       in good sooth  yes   cried master pettigrue heartily   what though he  be clothed in a joseph s coat of many colours  and hath strange turns  of speech  no man could have fought more stoutly or shown a bolder front  against the enemies of israel  surely the youth hath good in his heart   and will become a seat of grace and a vessel of the spirit  though  at present he be entangled in the net of worldly follies and carnal  vanities       it is to be hoped so   quoth saxon devoutly   and what else can you  tell us of the revolt  worthy sir       very little  save that the peasants have flocked in in such numbers  that many have had to be turned away for want of arms  every tithing man  in somersetshire is searching for axes and scythes  there is not  a blacksmith but is at his forge from morn to night at work upon  pike heads  there are six thousand men of a sort in the camp  but  not one in five carries a musket  they have advanced  i hear  upon  axminster  where they must meet the duke of albemarle  who hath set out  from exeter with four thousand of the train bands       then we shall be too late  after all   i exclaimed      you will have enough of battles before monmouth exchanges his  riding hat for a crown  and his laced roquelaure for the royal purple    quoth saxon   should our worthy friend here be correctly informed and  such an engagement take place  it will but be the prologue to the play   when feversham and churchill come up with the king s own troops  it is  then that monmouth takes the last spring  that lands him either on the  throne or the scaffold      whilst this conversation had been proceeding we had been walking our  horses down the winding track which leads along the eastern slope of  taunton deane  for some time past we had been able to see in the valley  beneath us the lights of taunton town and the long silver strip of  the river tone  the moon was shining brightly in a cloudless heaven   throwing a still and peaceful radiance over the fairest and richest of  english valleys  lordly manorial houses  pinnacled towers  clusters of  nestling thatch roofed cottages  broad silent stretches of cornland   dark groves with the glint of lamp lit windows shining from their  recesses  it all lay around us like the shadowy  voiceless landscapes  which stretch before us in our dreams  so calm and so beautiful was the  scene that we reined up our horses at the bend of the pathway  the tired  and footsore peasants came to a halt  while even the wounded raised  themselves in the waggon in order to feast their eyes upon this land of  promise  suddenly  in the stillness  a strong fervent voice was heard  calling upon the source of all life to guard and preserve that which  he had created  it was joshua pettigrue  who had flung himself upon his  knees  and who  while asking for future guidance  was returning thanks  for the safe deliverance which his flock had experienced from the many  perils which had beset them upon their journey  i would  my children   that i had one of those magic crystals of which we have read  that i  might show you that scene  the dark figures of the horsemen  the grave   earnest bearing of the rustics as they knelt in prayer or leaned upon  their rude weapons  the half cowed  half sneering expression of the  captive dragoons  the line of white pain drawn faces that peeped  over the side of the waggon  and the chorus of groans  cries  and  ejaculations which broke in upon the steady earnest voice of the pastor   above us the brilliant heavens  beneath us the beautiful sloping valley   stretching away in the white moonlight as far as the eye could reach   could i but paint such a scene with the brush of a verrio or laguerre  i  should have no need to describe it in these halting and feeble words     master pettigrue had concluded his thanksgiving  and was in the act of  rising to his feet  when the musical peal of a bell rose up from the  sleeping town before us  for a minute or more it rose and fell in its  sweet clear cadence  then a second with a deeper  harsher note joined  in  and then a third  until he air was filled with the merry jangling   at the same time a buzz of shouting or huzzaing could be heard  which  increased and spread until it swelled into a mighty uproar  lights  flashed in the windows  drums beat  and the whole place was astir  these  sudden signs of rejoicing coming at the heels of the minister s prayer  were seized upon as a happy omen by the superstitious peasants  who set  up a glad cry  and pushing onwards were soon within the outskirts of the  town     the footpaths and causeway were black with throngs of the townsfolk   men  women  and children  many of whom were bearing torches and  lanthorns  all flocking in the same direction  following them we found  ourselves in the market place  where crowds of apprentice lads were  piling up faggots for a bonfire  while others were broaching two or  three great puncheons of ale  the cause of this sudden outbreak of  rejoicing was  we learned  that news had just come in that albemarle s  devonshire militia had partly deserted and partly been defeated at  axminster that very morning  on hearing of our own successful skirmish  the joy of the people became more tumultuous than ever  they rushed in  amongst us  pouring blessings on our heads  in their strange burring  west country speech  and embracing our horses as well as ourselves   preparations were soon made for our weary companions  a long empty wool  warehouse  thickly littered with straw  was put at their disposal  with  a tub of ale and a plentiful supply of cold meats and wheaten bread   for our own part we made our way down east street through the clamorous  hand shaking crowd to the white hart inn  where after a hasty meal we  were right glad to seek our couches  late into the night  however  our  slumbers were disturbed by the rejoicings of the mob  who  having burned  the effigies of lord sunderland and of gregory alford  mayor of lyme   continued to sing west country songs and puritan hymns into the small  hours of the morning         chapter xvii  of the gathering in the market square    the fair town in which we now found ourselves was  although monmouth  had not yet reached it  the real centre of the rebellion  it was a  prosperous place  with a great woollen and kersey trade  which gave  occupation to as many as seven thousand inhabitants  it stood high   therefore  amongst english boroughs  being inferior only to bristol   norwich  bath  exeter  york  worcester  and nottingham amongst the  country towns  taunton had long been famous not only for its own  resources and for the spirit of its inhabitants  but also for the  beautiful and highly cultivated country which spread around it  and gave  rise to a gallant breed of yeomen  from time immemorial the town had  been a rallying point for the party of liberty  and for many years it  had leaned to the side of republicanism in politics and of puritanism  in religion  no place in the kingdom had fought more stoutly for  the parliament  and though it had been twice besieged by goring  the  burghers  headed by the brave robert blake  had fought so desperately   that the royalists had been compelled each time to retire discomfited   on the second occasion the garrison had been reduced to dog s flesh and  horse flesh  but no word of surrender had come either from them or  their heroic commander  who was the same blake under whom the old seaman  solomon sprent had fought against the dutch  after the restoration the  privy council had shown their recollection of the part played by the  somersetshire town  by issuing a special order that the battlements  which fenced round the maiden stronghold should be destroyed  thus   at the time of which i speak  nothing but a line of ruins and a few  unsightly mounds represented the massive line of wall which had been  so bravely defended by the last generation of townsmen  there were not  wanting  however  many other relics of those stormy times  the houses on  the outskirts were still scarred and splintered from the effects of  the bombs and grenades of the cavaliers  indeed  the whole town bore a  grimly martial appearance  as though she were a veteran among boroughs  who had served in the past  and was not averse to seeing the flash of  guns and hearing the screech of shot once more     charles s council might destroy the battlements which his soldiers had  been unable to take  but no royal edict could do away with the resolute  spirit and strong opinions of the burghers  many of them  born and bred  amidst the clash of civil strife  had been fired from their infancy by  the tales of the old war  and by reminiscences of the great assault when  lunsford s babe eaters were hurled down the main breach by the strong  arms of their fathers  in this way there was bred in taunton a fiercer  and more soldierly spirit than is usual in an english country town  and  this flame was fanned by the unwearied ministerings of a chosen band  of nonconformist clergymen  amongst whom joseph alleine was the most  conspicuous  no better focus for a revolt could have been chosen  for  no city valued so highly those liberties and that creed which was in  jeopardy     a large body of the burghers had already set out to join the rebel army   but a good number had remained behind to guard the city  and these were  reinforced by gangs of peasants  like the one to which we had attached  ourselves  who had trooped in from the surrounding country  and now  divided their time between listening to their favourite preachers and  learning to step in line and to handle their weapons  in yard  street   and market square there was marching and drilling  night  morning  and  noon  as we rode out after breakfast the whole town was ringing with the  shouting of orders and the clatter of arms  our own friends of yesterday  marched into the market place at the moment we entered it  and no sooner  did they catch sight of us than they plucked off their hats and cheered  lustily  nor would they desist until we cantered over to them and took  our places at their head      they have vowed that none other should lead them   said the minister   standing by saxon s stirrup      i could not wish to lead stouter fellows   said he   let them deploy  into double line in front of the town hall  so  so  smartly there  rear  rank   he shouted  facing his horse towards them   now swing round into  position  keep your ground  left flank  and let the others pivot upon  you  so  as hard and as straight as an andrea ferrara  i prythee   friend  do not carry your pike as though it were a hoe  though i trust  you will do some weeding in the lord s vineyard with it  and you  sir   your musquetoon should be sloped upon your shoulder  and not borne under  your arm like a dandy s cane  did ever an unhappy soldier find himself  called upon to make order among so motley a crew  even my good friend  the fleming cannot so avail here  nor does petrinus  in his  de re  militari   lay down any injunctions as to the method of drilling a man  who is armed with a sickle or a scythe       shoulder scythe  port scythe  present scythe  mow   whispered reuben to  sir gervas  and the pair began to laugh  heedless of the angry frowns of  saxon      let us divide them   he said   into three companies of eighty men  or  stay  how many musketeers have we in all  five and fifty  let them stand  forward  and form the first line or company  sir gervas jerome  you have  officered the militia of your county  and have doubtless some knowledge  of the manual exercise  if i am commandant of this force i hand over the  captaincy of this company to you  it shall be the first line in battle   a position which i know you will not be averse to       gad  they ll have to powder their heads   said sir gervas  with  decision      you shall have the entire ordering of them   saxon answered   let the  first company take six paces to the front  so  now let the pikemen stand  out  eighty seven  a serviceable company  lockarby  do you take these  men in hand  and never forget that the german wars have proved that the  best of horse has no more chance against steady pikemen than the waves  against a crag  take the captaincy of the second company  and ride at  their head       faith  if they don t fight better than their captain rides   whispered  reuben   it will be an evil business  i trust they will be firmer in the  field than i am in the saddle       the third company of scythesmen i commit to your charge  captain micah  clarke   continued saxon   good master joshua pettigrue will be our  field chaplain  shall not his voice and his presence be to us as  manna in the wilderness  and as springs of water in dry places  the  under officers i see that you have yourselves chosen  and your captains  shall have power to add to the number from those who smite boldly and  spare not  now one thing i have to say to you  and i speak it that all  may hear  and that none may hereafter complain that the rules he serves  under were not made clear to him  for i tell you now that when the  evening bugle calls  and the helm and pike are laid aside  i am as you  and you as i  fellow workers in the same field  and drinkers from the  same wells of life  lo  i will pray with you  or preach with you  or  hearken with you  or expound to you  or do aught that may become a  brother pilgrim upon the weary road  but hark you  friends  when we are  in arms and the good work is to be done  on the march  in the field  or  on parade  then let your bearing be strict  soldierly  and scrupulous   quick to hear and alert to obey  for i shall have no sluggards or  laggards  and if there be any such my hand shall be heavy upon them   yea  even to the cutting of them off  i say there shall be no mercy for  such   here he paused and surveyed his force with a set face and his  eyelids drawn low over his glinting  shifting eyes   if  then   he  continued   there is any man among you who fears to serve under a hard  discipline  let him stand forth now  and let him betake him to some  easier leader  for i say to you that whilst i command this corps   saxon s regiment of wiltshire foot shall be worthy to testify in this  great and soul raising cause      the colonel stopped and sat silent upon his mare  the long lines of  rustic faces looked up  some stolidly  some admiringly  some with an  expression of fear at his stern  gaunt face and baneful eyes  none  moved  however  so he continued      worthy master timewell  the mayor of this fair town of taunton  who  has been a tower of strength to the faithful during these long and  spirit trying times  is about to inspect us when the others shall have  assembled  captains  to your companies then  close up there on the  musqueteers  with three paces between each line  scythesmen  take ground  to your left  let the under officers stand on the flanks and rear  so    tis smartly done for a first venture  though a good adjutant with a  prugel after the imperial fashion might find work to do      whilst we were thus rapidly and effectively organising ourselves into a  regiment  other bodies of peasantry more or less disciplined had marched  into the market square  and had taken up their position there  those  on our right had come from frome and radstock  in the north of  somersetshire  and were a mere rabble armed with flails  hammers  and  other such weapons  with no common sign of order or cohesion save the  green boughs which waved in their hat bands  the body upon our left  who  bore a banner amongst them announcing that they were men of dorset  were  fewer in number but better equipped  having a front rank  like our own   entirely armed with muskets     the good townsmen of taunton  with their wives and their daughters   had meanwhile been assembling on the balconies and at the windows which  overlooked the square  whence they might have a view of the pageant  the  grave  square bearded  broadclothed burghers  and their portly dames in  velvet and three piled taffeta  looked down from every post of vantage   while here and there a pretty  timid face peeping out from a puritan  coif made good the old claim  that taunton excelled in beautiful women  as well as in gallant men  the side walks were crowded with the commoner  folk  old white bearded wool workers  stern faced matrons  country  lasses with their shawls over their heads  and swarms of children  who  cried out with their treble voices for king monmouth and the protestant  succession      by my faith   said sir gervas  reining back his steed until he was  abreast of me   our square toed friends need not be in such post haste  to get to heaven when they have so many angels among them on earth   gad s wounds  are they not beautiful  never a patch or a diamond amongst  them  and yet what would not our faded belles of the mall or the piazza  give for their innocence and freshness       nay  for heaven s sake do not smile and bow at them   said i   these  courtesies may pass in london  but they may be misunderstood among  simple somerset maidens and their hot headed  hard handed kinsfolk      i had hardly spoken before the folding doors of the town hall were  thrown open  and a procession of the city fathers emerged into the  market place  two trumpeters in parti coloured jerkins preceded them   who blew a flourish upon their instruments as they advanced  behind came  the aldermen and councilmen  grave and reverend elders  clad in their  sweeping gowns of black silk  trimmed and tippeted with costly furs   in rear of these walked a pursy little red faced man  the town clerk   bearing a staff of office in his hand  while the line of dignitaries  was closed by the tall and stately figure of stephen timewell  mayor of  taunton     there was much in this magistrate s appearance to attract attention  for  all the characteristics of the puritan party to which he belonged were  embodied and exaggerated in his person  of great height he was and very  thin  with a long drawn  heavy eyelidded expression  which spoke of  fasts and vigils  the bent shoulders and the head sunk upon the breast  proclaimed the advances of age  but his bright steel grey eyes and the  animation of his eager face showed how the enthusiasm of religion  could rise superior to bodily weakness  a peaked  straggling grey beard  descended half way to his waist  and his long snow white hairs fluttered  out from under a velvet skull cap  the latter was drawn tightly down  upon his head  so as to make his ears protrude in an unnatural manner  on either side  a custom which had earned for his party the title of   prickeared   so often applied to them by their opponents  his attire  was of studious plainness and sombre in colour  consisting of his black  mantle  dark velvet breeches  and silk hosen  with velvet bows upon his  shoes instead of the silver buckles then in vogue  a broad chain of gold  around his neck formed the badge of his office  in front of him strutted  the fat red vested town clerk  one hand upon his hip  the other extended  and bearing his wand of office  looking pompously to right and left   and occasionally bowing as though the plaudits were entirely on his own  behalf  this little man had tied a huge broadsword to his girdle  which  clanked along the cobble stones when he walked and occasionally inserted  itself between his legs  when he would gravely cock his foot over it  again and walk on without any abatement of his dignity  at last  finding  these interruptions become rather too frequent  he depressed the hilt of  his great sword in order to elevate the point  and so strutted onwards  like a bantam cock with a tingle straight feather in its tail     having passed round the front and rear of the various bodies  and  inspected them with a minuteness and attention which showed that his  years had not dulled his soldier s faculties  the mayor faced round with  the evident intention of addressing us  his clerk instantly darted in  front of him  and waving his arms began to shout  silence  good people   silence for his most worshipful the mayor of taunton  silence for  the worthy master stephen timewell   until in the midst of his  gesticulations and cries he got entangled once more with his overgrown  weapon  and went sprawling on his hands and knees in the kennel      silence yourself  master tetheridge   said the chief magistrate  severely   if your sword and your tongue were both clipped  it would be  as well for yourself and us  shall i not speak a few words in season  to these good people but you must interrupt with your discordant  bellowings      the busybody gathered himself together and slunk behind the group of  councilmen  while the mayor slowly ascended the steps of the market  cross  from this position he addressed us  speaking in a high piping  voice which gathered strength as he proceeded  until it was audible at  the remotest corners of the square      friends in the faith   he said   i thank the lord that i have been  spared in my old age to look down upon this goodly assembly  for we of  taunton have ever kept the flame of the covenant burning amongst us   obscured it may be at times by time servers and laodiceans  but none the  less burning in the hearts of our people  all round us  however   there was a worse than egyptian darkness  where popery and prelacy   arminianism  erastianism  and simony might rage and riot unchecked and  unconfined  but what do i see now  do i see the faithful cowering  in their hiding places and straining their ears for the sound of the  horsehoof s of their oppressors  do i see a time serving generation   with lies on their lips and truth buried in their hearts  no  i see  before me godly men  not from this fair city only  but from the broad  country round  and from dorset  and from wiltshire  and some even as i  hear from hampshire  all ready and eager to do mighty work in the cause  of the lord  and when i see these faithful men  and when i think that  every broad piece in the strong boxes of my townsmen is ready to support  them  and when i know that the persecuted remnant throughout the country  is wrestling hard in prayer for us  then a voice speaks within me and  tells me that we shall tear down the idols of dagon  and build up in  this england of ours such a temple of the true faith that not popery   nor prelacy  nor idolatry  nor any other device of the evil one shall  ever prevail against it      a deep irrepressible hum of approval burst from the close ranks of  the insurgent infantry  with a clang of arms as musquetoon or pike was  grounded upon the stone pavement     saxon half turned his fierce face  raising an impatient hand  and the  hoarse murmur died away among our men  though our less disciplined  companions to right and left continued to wave their green boughs and to  clatter their arms  the taunton men opposite stood grim and silent  but  their set faces and bent brows showed that their townsman s oratory had  stirred the deep fanatic spirit which distinguished them      in my hands   continued the mayor  drawing a roll of paper from his  bosom   is the proclamation which our royal leader hath sent in advance  of him  in his great goodness and self abnegation he had  in his early  declaration given forth at lyme  declared that he should leave the  choice of a monarch to the commons of england  but having found that  his enemies did most scandalously and basely make use of this his  self denial  and did assert that he had so little confidence in his own  cause that he dared not take publicly the title which is due to him  he  hath determined that this should have an end  know  therefore  that it  is hereby proclaimed that james  duke of monmouth  is now and henceforth  rightful king of england  that james stuart  the papist and fratricide   is a wicked usurper  upon whose head  dead or alive  a price of five  thousand guineas is affixed  and that the assembly now sitting at  westminster  and calling itself the commons of england  is an illegal  assembly  and its acts are null and void in the sight of the law  god  bless king monmouth and the protestant religion      the trumpeters struck up a flourish and the people huzzaed  but the  mayor raised his thin white hands as a signal for silence   a messenger  hath reached me this morning from the king   he continued   he sends a  greeting to all his faithful protestant subjects  and having halted at  axminster to rest after his victory  he will advance presently and be  with ye in two days at the latest      ye will grieve to hear that good alderman rider was struck down in the  thick of the fray  he hath died like a man and a christian  leaving all  his worldly goods  together with his cloth works and household property   to the carrying on of the war  of the other slain there are not more  than ten of taunton birth  two gallant young brothers have been cut off   oliver and ephraim hollis  whose poor mother        grieve not for me  good master timewell   cried a female voice from the  crowd   i have three others as stout  who shall all be offered in the  same quarrel       you are a worthy woman  mistress hollis   the mayor answered   and your  children shall not be lost to you  the next name upon my list is jesse  trefail  then come joseph millar  and aminadab holt       an elderly musqueteer in the first line of the taunton foot pulled his  hat down over his brows and cried out in a loud steady voice   the lord  hath given and the lord hath taken away  blessed be the name of the  lord       it is your only son  master holt   said the mayor   but the lord also  sacrificed his only son that you and i might drink the waters of eternal  life  the others are path of light regan  james fletcher  salvation  smith  and robert johnstone      the old puritan gravely rolled up his papers  and having stood for a  few moments with his hands folded across his breast in silent prayer  he  descended from the market cross  and moved off  followed by the aldermen  and councilmen  the crowd began likewise to disperse in sedate and sober  fashion  with grave earnest faces and downcast eyes  a large number of  the countryfolk  however  more curious or less devout than the citizens   gathered round our regiment to see the men who had beaten off the  dragoons      see the mon wi  a face like a gerfalcon   cried one  pointing to saxon     tis he that slew the philistine officer yestreen  an  brought the  faithful off victorious       mark ye yon other one   cried an old dame   him wi  the white face an   the clothes like a prince  he s one o  the quality  what s come a  the  way froe lunnon to testify to the protestant creed  he s a main pious  gentleman  he is  an  if he had bided in the wicked city they d ha  had  his head off  like they did the good lord roossell  or put him in chains  wi  the worthy maister baxter       marry come up  gossip   cried a third   the girt mun on the grey horse  is the soldier for me  he has the smooth cheeks o  a wench  an  limbs  like goliath o  gath  i ll war nt he could pick up my old gaffer jones  an  awa  wi  him at his saddle bow  as easy as towser does a rotten  but  here s good maister tetheridge  the clerk  and on great business too   for he s a mun that spares ne time ne trooble in the great cause       room  good people  room   cried the little clerk  bustling up with an  air of authority   hinder not the high officials of the corporation in  the discharge of their functions  neither should ye hamper the flanks  of fighting men  seeing that you thereby prevent that deploying and  extending of the line which is now advocated by many high commanders   i prythee  who commands this cohort  or legion rather  seeing that you  have auxiliary horse attached to it        tis a regiment  sirrah   said saxon sternly   colonel saxon s regiment  of wiltshire foot  which i have the honour to command       i beg your colonelship s pardon   cried the clerk nervously  edging  away from the swarthy faced soldier   i have heard speak of your  colonelship  and of your doings in the german wars  i have myself  trailed a pike in my youth and have broken a head or two  aye  and a  heart or two also  when i wore buff and bandolier       discharge your message   said our colonel shortly       tis from his most worshipful the mayor  and is addressed to yourself  and to your captains  who are doubtless these tall cavaliers whom i see  on either side of me  pretty fellows  by my faith  but you and i know  well  colonel  that a little trick of fence will set the smallest of us  on a level with the brawniest  now i warrant that you and i  being  old soldiers  could  back to back  make it good against these three  gallants       speak  fellow   snarled saxon  and reaching out a long sinewy arm he  seized the loquacious clerk by the lappet of his gown  and shook him  until his long sword clattered again      how  colonel  how   cried master tetheridge  while his vest seemed to  acquire a deeper tint from the sudden pallor of his face   would you  lay an angry hand upon the mayor s representative  i wear a bilbo by my  side  as you can see  i am also somewhat quick and choleric  and warn  you therefore not to do aught which i might perchance construe into a  personal slight  as to my message  it was that his most worshipful  the mayor did desire to have word with you and your captains in the  town hall       we shall be there anon   said saxon  and turning to the regiment he set  himself to explain some of the simpler movements and exercises  teaching  his officers as well as his men  for though sir gervas knew something of  the manual  lockarby and i brought little but our good will to the task   when the order to dismiss was at last given  our companies marched back  to their barracks in the wool warehouse  while we handed over our horses  to the grooms from the white hart  and set off to pay our respects to  the mayor         chapter xviii  of master stephen timewell  mayor of taunton    within the town hall all was bustle and turmoil  at one side behind a  low table covered with green baize sat two scriveners with great rolls  of paper in front of them  a long line of citizens passed slowly before  them  each in turn putting down a roll or bag of coins which was duly  noted by the receivers  a square iron bound chest stood by their side   into which the money was thrown  and we noted as we passed that it was  half full of gold pieces  we could not but mark that many of the givers  were men whose threadbare doublets and pinched faces showed that the  wealth which they were dashing down so readily must have been hoarded up  for such a purpose  at the cost of scanty fare and hard living  most of  them accompanied their gift by a few words of prayer  or by some pithy  text anent the treasure which rusteth not  or the lending to the lord   the town clerk stood by the table giving forth the vouchers for each  sum  and the constant clack of his tongue filled the hall  as he read  aloud the names and amounts  with his own remarks between      abraham willis   he shouted as we entered   put him down twenty six  pounds and ten shillings  you shall receive ten per centum upon this  earth  master willis  and i warrant that it shall not be forgotten  hereafter  john standish  two pounds  william simons  two guineas   stand fast healing  forty five pounds  that is a rare blow which you  have struck into the ribs of prelacy  good master healing  solomon  warren  five guineas  james white  five shillings  the widow s mite   james  thomas bakewell  ten pounds  nay  master bakewell  surely out of  three farms on the banks of tone  and grazing land in the fattest part  of athelney  you can spare more than this for the good cause  we shall  doubtless see you again  alderman smithson  ninety pounds  aha  there is  a slap for the scarlet woman  a few more such and her throne shall be a  ducking stool  we shall break her down  worthy master smithson  even as  jehu  the son of nimshi  broke down the house of baal   so he babbled on  with praise  precept  and rebuke  though the grave and solemn burghers  took little notice of his empty clamour     at the other side of the hall were several long wooden drinking troughs   which were used for the storing of pikes and scythes  special messengers  and tithing men had been sent out to scour the country for arms  who   as they returned  placed their prizes here under the care of the  armourer general  besides the common weapons of the peasants there was a  puncheon half full of pistols and petronels  together with a good number  of muskets  screw guns  snaphances  birding pieces  and carbines  with  a dozen bell mouthed brass blunderbusses  and a few old fashioned  wall pieces  such as sakers and culverins taken from the manor houses of  the county  from the walls and the lumber rooms of these old dwellings  many other arms had been brought to light which were doubtless esteemed  as things of price by our forefathers  but which would seem strange to  your eyes in these days  when a musket may be fired once in every two  minutes  and will carry a ball to a distance of four hundred paces   there were halberds  battle axes  morning stars  brown bills  maces  and  ancient coats of chain mail  which might even now save a man from sword  stroke or pike thrust     in the midst of the coming and the going stood master timewell  the  mayor  ordering all things like a skilful and provident commander  i  could understand the trust and love which his townsmen had for him  as  i watched him labouring with all the wisdom of an old man and the  blithesomeness of a young one  he was hard at work as we approached in  trying the lock of a falconet  but perceiving us  he came forward and  saluted us with much kindliness      i have heard much of ye   said he   how ye caused the faithful to  gather to a head  and so beat off the horsemen of the usurper  it will  not be the last time  i trust  that ye shall see their backs  i hear   colonel saxon  that ye have seen much service abroad       i have been the humble tool of providence in much good work    said saxon  with a bow   i have fought with the swedes against the  brandenburgers  and again with the brandenburgers against the swedes  my  time and conditions with the latter having been duly carried out  i  have afterwards in the bavarian service fought against swedes and  brandenburgers combined  besides having undergone the great wars on the  danube against the turk  and two campaigns with the messieurs in the  palatinate  which latter might be better termed holiday making than  fighting       a soldierly record in very truth   cried the mayor  stroking his white  beard   i hear that you are also powerfully borne onwards in prayer and  song  you are  i perceive  one of the old breed of      colonel  the men  who were in the saddle all day  and on their knees half the night  when  shall we see the like of them again  a few such broken wrecks as i are  left  with the fire of our youth all burned out and nought left but the  ashes of lethargy and lukewarmness       nay  nay   said saxon   your position and present business will scarce  jump with the modesty of your words  but here are young men who will  find the fire if their elders bring the brains  this is captain micah  clarke  and captain lockarby  and captain the honourable sir gervas  jerome  who have all come far to draw their swords for the downtrodden  faith       taunton welcomes ye  young sirs   said the mayor  looking a  trifle askance  as i thought  at the baronet  who had drawn out his  pocket mirror  and was engaged in the brushing of his eyebrows   i trust  that during your stay in this town ye will all four take up your abode  with me   tis a homely roof and simple fare  but a soldier s wants are  few  and now  colonel  i would fain have your advice as to these three  drakes  whether if rehooped they may be deemed fit for service  and also  as to these demi cannons  which were used in the old parliamentary days   and may yet have a word to say in the people s cause      the old soldier and the puritan instantly plunged into a deep  and learned disquisition upon the merits of wall pieces  drakes   demi culverins  sakers  minions  mortar pieces  falcons  and  pattereroes  concerning all which pieces of ordnance saxon had strong  opinions to offer  fortified by many personal hazards and experiences   he then dwelt upon the merits of fire arrows and fire pikes in the  attack or defence of places of strength  and had finally begun to  descant upon sconces   directis lateribus   and upon works  semilunar   rectilineal  horizontal  or orbicular  with so many references to his  imperial majesty s lines at gran  that it seemed that his discourse  would never find an end  we slipped away at last  leaving him still  discussing the effects produced by the austrian grenadoes upon a  bavarian brigade of pikes at the battle of ober graustock      curse me if i like accepting this old fellow s offer   said sir gervas   in an undertone   i have heard of these puritan households  much grace  to little sack  and texts flying about as hard and as jagged as flint  stones  to bed at sundown  and a sermon ready if ye do but look kindly  at the waiting wench or hum the refrain of a ditty       his home may be larger  but it could scarce be stricter than that of my  own father   i remarked      i ll warrant that   cried reuben   when we have been a morris dancing   or having a saturday night game of  kiss in the ring   or   parson has lost his coat   i have seen ironside joe stride past us  and  cast a glance at us which hath frozen the smile upon our lips  i warrant  that he would have aided colonel pride to shoot the bears and hack down  the maypoles        twere fratricide for such a man to shoot a bear   quoth sir gervas    with all respect  friend clarke  for your honoured progenitor       no more than for you to shoot at a popinjay   i answered  laughing    but as to the mayor s offer  we can but go to meat with him now  and  should it prove irksome it will be easy for you to plead some excuse   and so get honourably quit of it  but bear in mind  sir gervas  that  such households are in very truth different to any with which you are  acquainted  so curb your tongue or offence may come of it  should i cry   hem   or cough  it will be a sign to you that you had best beware       agreed  young solomon   cried he   it is  indeed  well to have a pilot  like yourself who knows these godly waters  for my own part  i should  never know how near i was to the shoals  but our friends have finished  the battle of ober what s its name  and are coming towards us  i trust   worthy mr  mayor  that your difficulties have been resolved       they are  sir   replied the puritan   i have been much edified by your  colonel s discourse  and i have little doubt that by serving under him  ye will profit much by his ripe experience       very like  sir  very like   said sir gervas carelessly      but it is nigh one o clock   the mayor continued   our frail flesh  cries aloud for meat and drink  i beg that ye will do me the favour to  accompany me to my humble dwelling  where we shall find the household  board already dressed      with these words he led the way out of the hall and paced slowly down  fore street  the people falling back to right and to left as he passed   and raising their caps to do him reverence  here and there  as he  pointed out to us  arrangements had been made for barring the road with  strong chains to prevent any sudden rush of cavalry  in places  too  at  the corner of a house  a hole had been knocked in the masonry through  which peeped the dark muzzle of a carronade or wall piece  these  precautions were the more necessary as several bodies of the royal  horse  besides the one which we had repulsed  were known to be within  the deane  and the town  deprived of its ramparts  was open to an  incursion from any daring commander     the chief magistrate s house was a squat square faced stone building  within a court which opened on to east street  the peaked oak door   spangled with broad iron nails  had a gloomy and surly aspect  but  the hall within was lightful and airy  with a bright polished cedar  planking  and high panelling of some dark grained wood which gave forth  a pleasant smell as of violets  a broad night of steps rose up from the  farther end of the hall  down which as we entered a young sweet faced  maid came tripping  with an old dame behind her  who bore in her hands a  pile of fresh napery  at the sight of us the elder one retreated up the  stairs again  whilst the younger came flying down three steps at a  time  threw her arms round the old mayor s neck  and kissed him fondly   looking hard into his face the while  as a mother gazes into that of a  child with whom she fears that aught may have gone amiss      weary again  daddy  weary again   she said  shaking her head anxiously   with a small white hand upon each of his shoulders   indeed  and indeed   thy spirit is greater than thy strength       nay  nay  lass   said he  passing his hand fondly over her rich brown  hair  the workman must toil until the hour of rest is rung  this   gentlemen  is my granddaughter ruth  the sole relic of my family and the  light of mine old age  the whole grove hath been cut down  and only the  oldest oak and the youngest sapling left  these cavaliers  little one   have come from afar to serve the cause  and they have done us the honour  to accept of our poor hospitality       ye are come in good time  gentlemen   she answered  looking us straight  in the eyes with a kindly smile as a sister might greet her brothers    the household is gathered round the table and the meal is ready       but not more ready than we   cried the stout old burgher   do thou  conduct our guests to their places  whilst i seek my room and doff these  robes of office  with my chain and tippet  ere i break my fast      following our fair guide we passed into a very large and lofty room  the  walls of which were wainscoted with carved oak  and hung at either end  with tapestry  the floor was tesselated after the french fashion  and  plentifully strewn with skins and rugs  at one end of the apartment  stood a great white marble fireplace  like a small room in itself   fitted up  as was the ancient custom  with an iron stand in the centre   and with broad stone benches in the recess on either side  lines of  hooks above the chimneypiece had been used  as i surmise  to support  arms  for the wealthy merchants of england were wont to keep enough in  their houses to at least equip their apprentices and craftsmen  they  had now  however  been removed  nor was there any token of the troublous  times save a single heap of pikes and halberds piled together in a  corner     down the centre of this room there ran a long and massive table  which  was surrounded by thirty or forty people  the greater part of whom were  men  they were on their feet as we entered  and a grave faced man at the  farther end was drawling forth an interminable grace  which began as a  thanksgiving for food  but wandered away into questions of church and  state  and finally ended in a supplication for israel now in arms to do  battle for the lord  while this was proceeding we stood in a group  by the door with our caps doffed  and spent our time in observing the  company more closely than we could have done with courtesy had their  eyes not been cast down and their thoughts elsewhere     they were of all ages  from greybeards down to lads scarce out of their  teens  all with the same solemn and austere expression of countenance   and clad in the same homely and sombre garb  save their wide white  collars and cuffs  not a string of any colour lessened the sad severity  of their attire  their black coats and doublets were cut straight and  close  and their cordovan leather shoes  which in the days of our youth  were usually the seat of some little ornament  were uniformly square  toed and tied with sad coloured ribbon  most of them wore plain  sword belts of untanned hide  but the weapons themselves  with their  broad felt hats and black cloaks  were laid under the benches or placed  upon the settles which lined the walls  they stood with their hands  clasped and their heads bent  listening to the untimely address  and  occasionally by some groan or exclamation testifying that the preacher s  words had moved them     the overgrown grace came at last to an end  when the company sat  silently down  and proceeded without pause or ceremony to attack the  great joints which smoked before them  our young hostess led us to the  end of the table  where a high carded chair with a black cushion upon it  marked the position of the master of the house  mistress timewell seated  herself upon the right of the mayor s place  with sir gervas beside her   while the post of honour upon the left was assigned to saxon  on my left  sat lockarby  whose eyes i observed had been fixed in undisguised and  all absorbing admiration upon the puritan maiden from the first moment  that he had seen her  the table was of no great breadth  so that we  could talk across in spite of the clatter of plates and dishes  the  bustle of servants  and the deep murmur of voices      this is my father s household   said our hostess  addressing herself to  saxon   there is not one of them who is not in his employ  he hath many  apprentices in the wool trade  we sit down forty to meat every day in  the year       and to right good fare  too   quoth saxon  glancing down the table    salmon  ribs of beef  loin of mutton  veal  pasties  what could man  wish for more  plenty of good home brewed  too  to wash it down  if  worthy master timewell can arrange that the army be victualled after the  same fashion  i for one shell be beholden to him  a cup of dirty water  and a charred morsel cooked on a ramrod over the camp fire are like to  take the place of these toothsome dainties       is it not best to have faith   said the puritan maiden   shall not the  almighty feed his soldiers even as elisha was fed in the wilderness and  hagar in the desert       aye   exclaimed a lanky haired  swarthy young man who sat upon the  right of sir gervas   he will provide for us  even as the stream of  water gushed forth out of dry places  even as the quails and the manna  lay thick upon barren soil       so i trust  young sir   quoth saxon   but we must none the less arrange  a victual train  with a staff of wains  duly numbered  and an intendant  over each  after the german fashion  such things should not be left to  chance      pretty mistress timewell glanced up with a half startled look at this  remark  as though shocked at the want of faith implied in it  her  thoughts might have taken the form of words had not her father entered  the room at the moment  the whole company rising and bowing to him as he  advanced to his seat      be seated  friends   said he  with a wave of his hand   we are a homely  folk  colonel saxon  and the old time virtue of respect for our elders  has not entirely forsaken us  i trust  ruth   he continued   that thou  hast seen to the wants of our guests      we all protested that we had never received such attention and  hospitality       tis well   tis well   said the good wool worker   but your plates are  clear and your glasses empty  william  look to it  a good workman  is ever a good trencherman  if a  prentice of mine cannot clean his  platter  i know that i shall get little from him with carder and teazel   thew and sinew need building up  a slice from that round of beef   william  touching that same battle of ober graustock  colonel  what part  was played in the fray by that regiment of pandour horse  in which  as i  understand  thou didst hold a commission      this was a question on which  as may be imagined  saxon had much to say   and the pair were soon involved in a heated discussion  in which the  experiences of roundway down and marston moor were balanced against the  results of a score of unpronounceable fights in the styrian alps and  along the danube  stephen timewell in his lusty youth had led first  a troop and then a regiment through the wars of the parliament  from  chalgrove field to the final battle at worcester  so that his warlike  passages  though less varied and extensive than those of our companion   were enough to enable him to form and hold strong opinions  these were  in the main the same as those of the soldier of fortune  but when their  ideas differed upon any point  there arose forthwith such a cross fire  of military jargon  such speech of estacados and palisados  such  comparisons of light horse and heavy  of pikemen and musqueteers   of lanzknechte  leaguers  and on falls  that the unused ear became  bewildered with the babble  at last  on some question of fortification   the mayor drew his outworks with the spoons and knives  on which saxon  opened his parallels with lines of bread  and pushing them rapidly  up with traverses and covered ways  he established himself upon the  re entering angle of the mayor s redoubt  this opened up a fresh  question as to counter mines  with the result that the dispute raged  with renewed vigour     whilst this friendly strife was proceeding between the elders  sir  gervas jerome and mistress ruth had fallen into conversation at the  other side of the table  i have seldom seen  my dear children  so  beautiful a face as that of this puritan damsel  and it was beautiful  with that sort of modest and maidenly comeliness where the features  derive their sweetness from the sweet soul which shines through them   the perfectly moulded body appeared to be but the outer expression of  the perfect spirit within  her dark brown hair swept back from a broad  and white forehead  which surmounted a pair of well marked eyebrows and  large blue thoughtful eyes  the whole cast of her features was gentle  and dove like  yet there was a firmness in the mouth and delicate  prominence of the chin which might indicate that in times of trouble and  danger the little maid would prove to be no unworthy descendant of the  roundhead soldier and puritan magistrate  i doubt not that where more  loud tongued and assertive dames might be cowed  the mayor s soft voiced  daughter would begin to cast off her gentler disposition  and to show  the stronger nature which underlay it  it amused me much to listen to  the efforts which sir gervas made to converse with her  for the damsel  and he lived so entirely in two different worlds  that it took all his  gallantry and ready wit to keep on ground which would be intelligible to  her      no doubt you spend much of your time in reading  mistress ruth   he  remarked   it puzzles me to think what else you can do so far from  town       town   said she in surprise   what is taunton but a town       heaven forbid that i should deny it   replied sir gervas   more  especially in the presence of so many worthy burghers  who have the name  of being somewhat jealous of the honour of their native city  yet the  fact remains  fair mistress  that the town of london so far transcends  all other towns that it is called  even as i called it just now   the   town       is it so very large  then   she cried  with pretty wonder   but new  louses are building in taunton  outside the old walls  and beyond  shuttern  and some even at the other side of the river  perhaps in time  it may be as large       if all the folks in taunton were to be added to london   said sir  gervas   no one there would observe that there had been any increase       nay  there you are laughing at me  that is against all reason   cried  the country maiden      your grandfather will bear out my words   said sir gervas   but to  return to your reading  i ll warrant that there is not a page of  scudery and her  grand cyrus  which you have not read  you are familiar   doubtless  with every sentiment in cowley  or waller  or dryden       who are these   she asked   at what church do they preach       faith   cried the baronet  with a laugh   honest john preaches at the  church of will unwin  commonly known as will s  where many a time it  is two in the morning before he comes to the end of his sermon  but why  this question  do you think that no one may put pen to paper unless they  have also a right to wear a gown and climb up to a pulpit  i had thought  that all of your sex had read dryden  pray  what are your own favourite  books       there is alleine s  alarm to the unconverted    said she   it is a  stirring work  and one which hath wrought much good  hast thou not found  it to fructify within thee       i have not read the book you name   sir gervas confessed      not read it   she cried  with raised eyebrows   truly i had thought  that every one had read the  alarm   what dost thou think  then  of   faithful contendings        i have not read it       or of baxter s sermons   she asked      i have not read them       of bull s  spirit cordial   then       i have not read it      mistress ruth timewell stared at him in undisguised wonder   you may  think me ill bred to say it  sir   she remarked   but i cannot but  marvel where you have been  or what you have done all your life  why   the very children in the street have read these books       in truth  such works come little in our way in london   sir gervas  answered   a play of george etherege s  or a jingle of sir john  suckling s is lighter  though mayhap less wholesome food for the mind   a man in london may keep pace with the world of letters without  much reading  for what with the gossip of the coffee houses and the  news letters that fall in his way  and the babble of poets or wits  at the assemblies  with mayhap an evening or two in the week at the  playhouse  with vanbrugh or farquhar  one can never part company for  long with the muses  then  after the play  if a man is in no humour for  a turn of luck at the green table at the groom porter s  he may stroll  down to the coca tree if he be a tory  or to st  james s if he be a  whig  and it is ten to one if the talk turn not upon the turning of  alcaics  or the contest between blank verse or rhyme  then one may   after an arriere supper  drop into will s or slaughter s and find old  john  with tickell and congreve and the rest of them  hard at work  on the dramatic unities  or poetical justice  or some such matter  i  confess that my own tastes lay little in that line  for about that hour  i was likely to be worse employed with wine flask  dice box  or        hem  hem   cried i warningly  for several of the puritans were  listening with faces which expressed anything but approval      what you say of london is of much interest to me   said the puritan  maiden   though these names and places have little meaning to my  ignorant ears  you did speak  however  of the playhouse  surely no  worthy man goes near those sinks of iniquity  the baited traps of the  evil one  has not the good and sanctified master bull declared from  the pulpit that they are the gathering place of the froward  the chosen  haunts of the perverse assyrians  as dangerous to the soul as any  of those papal steeple houses wherein the creature is sacrilegiously  confounded with the creator       well and truly spoken  mistress timewell   cried the lean young  puritan upon the right  who had been an attentive listener to the whole  conversation   there is more evil in such houses than even in the cities  of the plain  i doubt not that the wrath of the lord will descend  upon them  and destroy them  and wreck them utterly  together with the  dissolute men and abandoned women who frequent them       your strong opinions  friend   said sir gervas quietly   are borne out  doubtless by your full knowledge of the subject  how often  prythee   have you been in these playhouses which you are so ready to decry       i thank the lord that i have never been so far tempted from the  straight path as to set foot within one   the puritan answered   nor  have i ever been in that great sewer which is called london  i trust   however  that i with others of the faithful may find our way thither  with our tucks at our sides ere this business is finished  when we shall  not be content  i ll warrant  with shutting these homes of vice  as  cromwell did  but we shall not leave one stone upon another  and shall  sow the spot with salt  that it may be a hissing and a byword amongst  the people       you are right  john derrick   said the mayor  who had overheard the  latter part of his remarks   yet methinks that a lower tone and a more  backward manner would become you better when you are speaking with your  master s guests  touching these same playhouses  colonel  when we have  carried the upper hand this time  we shall not allow the old tares to  check the new wheat  we know what fruit these places have borne in the  days of charles  the gwynnes  the palmers  and the whole base crew of  foul lecherous parasites  have you ever been in london  captain clarke       nay  sir  i am country born and bred       the better man you   said our host   i have been there twice  the first  time was in the days of the rump  when lambert brought in his division  to overawe the commons  i was then quartered at the sign of the four  crosses in southwark  then kept by a worthy man  one john dolman  with  whom i had much edifying speech concerning predestination  all was  quiet and sober then  i promise you  and you might have walked from  westminster to the tower in the dead of the night without hearing aught  save the murmur of prayer and the chanting of hymns  not a ruffler or  a wench was in the streets after dark  nor any one save staid citizens  upon their business  or the halberdiers of the watch  the second visit  which i made was over this business of the levelling of the ramparts   when i and neighbour foster  the glover  were sent at the head of a  deputation from this town to the privy council of charles  who could  have credited that a few years would have made such a change  every evil  thing that had been stamped underground had spawned and festered until  its vermin brood flooded the streets  and the godly wore themselves  driven to shun the light of day  apollyon had indeed triumphed for a  while  a quiet man could not walk the highways without being elbowed  into the kennel by swaggering swashbucklers  or accosted by painted  hussies  padders and michers  laced cloaks  jingling spurs  slashed  boots  tall plumes  bullies and pimps  oaths and blasphemies  i promise  you hell was waxing fat  even in the solitude of one s coach one was not  free from the robber       how that  sir   asked reuben      why marry  in this wise  as i was the sufferer i have the best right  to tell the tale  ye must know that after our reception  which was  cold enough  for we were about as welcome to the privy council as the  hearth tax man is to the village housewife  we were asked  more as  i guess from derision than from courtesy  to the evening levee at  buckingham palace  we would both fain have been excused from going but  we feared that our refusal might give undue offence  and so hinder the  success of our mission  my homespun garments ware somewhat rough for  such an occasion  yet i determined to appear in them  with the addition  of a new black baize waistcoat faced with silk  and a good periwig  for  which i gave three pounds ten shillings in the haymarket      the young puritan opposite turned up his eyes and murmured something  about  sacrificing to dagon   which fortunately for him was inaudible to  the high spirited old man      it was but a worldly vanity   quoth the mayor   for  with all  deference  sir gervas jerome  a man s own hair arranged with some taste   and with perhaps a sprinkling of powder  is to my mind the fittest  ornament to his head  it is the contents and not the case which  availeth  having donned this frippery  good master foster and i hired  a calash and drove to the palace  we were deep in grave and  i trust   profitable converse speeding through the endless streets  when of a  sudden i felt a sharp tug at my head  and my hat fluttered down on to my  knees  i raised my hands  and lo  they came upon my bare pate  the wig  had vanished  we were rolling down fleet street at the moment  and there  was no one in the calash save neighbour foster  who sat as astounded as  i  we looked high and low  on the seats and beneath them  but not a sign  of the periwig was there  it was gone utterly and without a trace       whither then   we asked with one voice      that was the question which we set ourselves to solve  for a moment i  do assure ye that we bethought us that it might be a judgment upon us  for our attention to such carnal follies  then it crossed my mind  that it might be the doing of some malicious sprite  as the drummer of  tedworth  or those who occasioned the disturbances no very long time  since at the old gast house at little burton here in somersetshire    note f  appendix   with this thought we hallooed to the coachman  and  told him what had occurred to us  the fellow came down from his  perch  and having heard our story  he burst straightway into much foul  language  and walking round to the back of his calash  showed us that  a slit had been made in the leather wherewith it was fashioned  through  this the thief had thrust his hand and had drawn my wig through the  hole  resting the while on the crossbar of the coach  it was no uncommon  thing  he said  and the wig snatchers were a numerous body who waited  beside the peruke maker s shops  and when they saw a customer come forth  with a purchase which was worth their pains they would follow him  and   should he chance to drive  deprive him of it in this fashion  be that as  it may  i never saw my wig again  and had to purchase another before i  could venture into the royal presence       a strange adventure truly   exclaimed saxon   how fared it with you for  the remainder of the evening       but scurvily  for charles s face  which was black enough at all  times  was blackest of all to us  nor was his brother the papist more  complaisant  they had but brought us there that they might dazzle us  with their glitter and gee gaws  in order that we might bear a fine  report of them back to the west with us  there were supple backed  courtiers  and strutting nobles  and hussies with their shoulders bare   who should for all their high birth have been sent to bridewell as  readily as any poor girl who ever walked at the cart s tail  then there  were the gentlemen of the chamber  with cinnamon and plum coloured  coats  and a brave show of gold lace and silk and ostrich feather   neighbour foster and i felt as two crows might do who have wandered  among the peacocks  yet we bare in mind in whose image we were  fashioned  and we carried ourselves  i trust  as independent english  burghers  his grace of buckingham had his flout at us  and rochester  sneered  and the women simpered  but we stood four square  my friend  and i  discussing  as i well remember  the most precious doctrines of  election and reprobation  without giving much heed either to those who  mocked us  or to the gamesters upon our left  or to the dancers upon  our right  so we stood throughout the evening  until  finding that they  could get little sport from us  my lord clarendon  the chancellor  gave  us the word to retire  which we did at our leisure after saluting the  king and the company       nay  that i should never have done   cried the young puritan  who had  listened intently to his elder s narrative   would it not have been  more fitting to have raised up your hands and called down vengeance upon  them  as the holy man of old did upon the wicked cities       more fitting  quotha   said the mayor impatiently   it is most fitting  that youth should be silent until his opinion is asked on such matters   god s wrath comes with leaden feet  but it strikes with iron hands  in  his own good time he has judged when the cup of these men s iniquities  is overflowing  it is not for us to instruct him  curses have  as the  wise man said  a habit of coming home to roost  bear that in mind   master john derrick  and be not too liberal with them      the young apprentice  for such he was  bowed his head sullenly to the  rebuke  whilst the mayor  after a short pause  resumed his story      being a fine night   said he   we chose to walk back to our lodgings   but never shall i forget the wicked scenes wherewith we were encountered  on the way  good master bunyan  of elstow  might have added some  pages to his account of vanity fair had he been with us  the women   be patched  be ruddled  and brazen  the men swaggering  roistering   cursing  the brawling  the drabbing  and the drunkenness  it was a fit  kingdom to be ruled over by such a court  at last we had made our way to  more quiet streets  and were hoping that our adventures were at an end   when of a sudden there came a rush of half drunken cavaliers from a side  street  who set upon the passers by with their swords  as though we had  fallen into an ambuscade of savages in some paynim country  they were   as i surmise  of the same breed as those of whom the excellent john  milton wrote   the sons of belial  flown with insolence and wine   alas   my memory is not what it was  for at one time i could say by rote whole  books of that noble and godly poem       and  pray  how fared ye with these rufflers  sir   i asked      they beset us  and some few other honest citizens who were wending  their ways homewards  and waving their naked swords they called upon us  to lay down our arms and pay homage   to whom   i asked  they pointed  to one of their number who was more gaudily dressed and somewhat  drunker than the rest   this is our most sovereign liege   they cried    sovereign over whom   i asked   over the tityre tus   they answered    oh  most barbarous and cuckoldy citizen  do you not recognise that you  have fallen into the hands of that most noble order    this is not your  real monarch   said i   for he is down beneath us chained in the pit   where some day he will gather his dutiful subjects around him    lo  he  hath spoken treason   they cried  on which  without much more ado  they  set upon us with sword and dagger  neighbour foster and i placed our  backs against a wall  and with our cloaks round our left arms we made  play with our tucks  and managed to put in one or two of the old wigan  lane raspers  in particular  friend foster pinked the king in such wise  that his majesty ran howling down the street like a gored bull pup  we  were beset by numbers  however  and might have ended our mission then  and there had not the watch appeared upon the scene  struck up our  weapons with their halberds  and so arrested the whole party  whilst the  fray lasted the burghers from the adjoining houses were pouring water  upon us  as though we were cats on the tiles  which  though it did  not cool our ardour in the fight  left us in a scurvy and unsavoury  condition  in this guise we were dragged to the round house  where we  spent the night amidst bullies  thieves  and orange wenches  to whom i  am proud to say that both neighbour foster and myself spoke some words  of joy and comfort  in the morning we were released  and forthwith shook  the dust of london from our feet  nor do i ever wish to return thither   unless it be at the head of our somersetshire regiments  to see king  monmouth don the crown which he had wrested in fair fight from the  popish perverter      as master stephen timewell ended his tale a general shuffling and rising  announced the conclusion of the meal  the company filed slowly out in  order of seniority  all wearing the same gloomy and earnest expression   with grave gait and downcast eyes  these puritan ways were  it is true   familiar to me from childhood  yet i had never before seen a large  household conforming to them  or marked their effect upon so many young  men      you shall bide behind for a while   said the mayor  as we were about  to follow the others   william  do you bring a flask of the old green  sealed sack  these creature comforts i do not produce before my lads   for beef and honest malt is the fittest food for such  on occasion   however  i am of paul s opinion  that a flagon of wine among friends is  no bad thing for mind or for body  you can away now  sweetheart  if you  have aught to engage you       do you go out again   asked mistress ruth      presently  to the town hall  the survey of arms is not yet complete       i shall have your robes ready  and also the rooms of our guests   she  answered  and so  with a bright smile to us  tripped away upon her duty      i would that i could order our town as that maiden orders this house    said the mayor   there is not a want that is not supplied before it is  felt  she reads my thoughts and acts upon them ere my lips have time to  form them  if i have still strength to spend in the public service  it  is because my private life is full of restful peace  do not fear the  sack  sirs  it cometh from brooke and hellier s of abchurch lane  and  may be relied upon       which showeth that one good thing cometh out of london   remarked sir  gervas      aye  truly   said the old man  smiling   but what think ye of my young  men  sir  they must needs be of a very different class to any with  whom you are acquainted  if  as i understand  you have frequented court  circles       why  marry  they are good enough young men  no doubt   sir gervas  answered lightly   methinks  however  that there is a want of sap about  them  it is not blood  but sour buttermilk that flows in their veins       nay  nay   the mayor responded warmly   there you do them an injustice   their passions and feelings are under control  as the skilful rider  keeps his horse in hand  but they are as surely there as is the speed  and endurance of the animal  did you observe the godly youth who sat  upon your right  whom i had occasion to reprove more than once for  over zeal  he is a fit example of how a man may take the upper hand of  his feelings  and keep them in control       and how has he done so   i asked      why  between friends   quoth the mayor   it was but last lady day that  he asked the hand of my granddaughter ruth in marriage  his time is  nearly served  and his father  sam derrick  is an honourable craftsman   so that the match would have been no unfitting one  the maiden turned  against him  however  young girls will have their fancies  and the  matter came to an end  yet here he dwells under the same roof tree  at  her elbow from morn to night  with never a sign of that passion which  can scarce have died out so soon  twice my wool warehouse hath been  nigh burned to the ground since then  and twice he hath headed those who  fought the flames  there are not many whose suit hath been rejected who  would bear themselves in so resigned and patient a fashion       i am prepared to find that your judgment is the correct one   said sir  gervas jerome   i have learned to distrust too hasty dislikes  and bear  in mind that couplet of john dryden                 errors  like straws  upon the surface flow              he who would search for pearls must dive below        or worthy dr  samuel butler   said saxon   who  in his immortal poem of   hudibras   says                 the fool can only see the skin              the wise man tries to peep within        i wonder  colonel saxon   said our host severely   that you should  speak favourably of that licentious poem  which is composed  as i have  heard  for the sole purpose of casting ridicule upon the godly  i should  as soon have expected to hear you praise the wicked and foolish work of  hobbes  with his mischievous thesis   a deo rex  a rege lex        it is true that i contemn and despise the use which butler hath made of  his satire   said saxon adroitly   yet i may admire the satire itself   just as one may admire a damascened blade without approving of the  quarrel in which it is drawn       these distinctions are  i fear  too subtle for my old brain   said the  stout old puritan   this england of ours is divided into two camps  that  of god and that of antichrist  he who is not with us is against us  nor  shall any who serve under the devil s banner have anything from me save  my scorn and the sharp edge of my sword       well  well   said saxon  filling up his glass   i am no laodicean or  time server  the cause shall not find me wanting with tongue or with  sword       of that i am well convinced  my worthy friend   the mayor answered    and if i have spoken over sharply you will hold me excused  but i  regret to have evil tidings to announce to you  i have not told the  commonalty lest it cast them down  but i know that adversity will be  but the whetstone to give your ardour a finer edge  argyle s rising has  failed  and he and his companions are prisoners in the hands of the man  who never knew what pity was      we all started in our chairs at this  and looked at one another aghast   save only sir gervas jerome  whose natural serenity was  i am well  convinced  proof against any disturbance  for you may remember  my  children  that i stated when i first took it in hand to narrate to you  these passages of my life  that the hopes of monmouth s party rested  very much upon the raid which argyle and the scottish exiles had  made upon ayrshire  where it was hoped that they would create such a  disturbance as would divert a good share of king james s forces  and so  make our march to london less difficult  this was the more confidently  expected since argyle s own estates lay upon that side of scotland   where he could raise five thousand swordsmen among his own clansmen   the western counties abounded  too  in fierce zealots who were ready to  assert the cause of the covenant  and who had proved themselves in many  a skirmish to be valiant warriors  with the help of the highlanders and  of the covenanters it seemed certain that argyle would be able to hold  his own  the more so since he took with him to scotland the english  puritan rumbold  and many others skilled in warfare  this sudden news  of his total defeat and downfall was therefore a heavy blow  since it  turned the whole forces of the government upon ourselves      have you the news from a trusty source   asked decimus saxon  after a  long silence      it is beyond all doubt or question   master stephen timewell answered    yet i can well understand your surprise  for the duke had trusty  councillors with him  there was sir patrick hume of polwarth        all talk and no fight   said saxon      and richard rumbold       all fight and no talk   quoth our companion   he should  methinks  have  rendered a better account of himself       then there was major elphinstone       a bragging fool   cried saxon       and sir john cochrane       a captious  long tongued  short witted sluggard   said the soldier of  fortune   the expedition was doomed from the first with such men at  its head  yet i had thought that could they have done nought else  they  might at least have flung themselves into the mountain country  where  these bare legged caterans could have held their own amid their native  clouds and mists  all taken  you say  it is a lesson and a warning  to us  i tell you that unless monmouth infuses more energy into his  councils  and thrusts straight for the heart instead of fencing and  foining at the extremities  we shall find ourselves as argyle and  rumbold  what mean these two days wasted at axminster at a time when  every hour is of import  is he  every time that he brushes a party  of militia aside  to stop forty eight hours and chant  te deums  when  churchill and feversham are  as i know  pushing for the west with every  available man  and the dutch grenadiers are swarming over like rats into  a granary       you are very right  colonel saxon   the mayor answered   and i trust  that when the king comes here we may stir him up to more prompt action   he has much need of more soldierly advisers  for since fletcher hath  gone there is hardly a man about him who hath been trained to arms       well   said saxon moodily   now that argyle hath gone under we are face  to face with james  with nothing but our own good swords to trust to       to them and to the justice of our cause  how like ye the news  young  sirs  has the wine lost its smack on account of it  are ye disposed to  flinch from the standard of the lord       for my own part i shall see the matter through   said i      and i shall bide where micah clarke bides   quoth reuben lockarby      and to me   said sir gervas   it is a matter of indifference  so long  as i am in good company and there is something stirring       in that case   said the mayor   we had best each turn to his own work   and have all ready for the king s arrival  until then i trust that ye  will honour my humble roof       i fear that i cannot accept your kindness   saxon answered   when i am  in harness i come and go early and late  i shall therefore take up my  quarters in the inn  which is not very well furnished with victual   and yet can supply me with the simple fare  which with a black jack of  october and a pipe of trinidado is all i require      as saxon was firm in this resolution the mayor forbore to press it upon  him  but my two friends gladly joined with me in accepting the worthy  wool worker s offer  and took up our quarters for the time under his  hospitable roof         chapter xix  of a brawl in the night    decimus saxon refused to avail himself of master timewell s house and  table for the reason  as i afterwards learned  that  the mayor being a  firm presbyterian  he thought it might stand him in ill stead with the  independents and other zealots were he to allow too great an intimacy  to spring up between them  indeed  my dears  from this time onward this  cunning man framed his whole life and actions in such a way as to make  friends of the sectaries  and to cause them to look upon him as their  leader  for he had a firm belief that in all such outbreaks as that in  which we were engaged  the most extreme party is sure in the end to gain  the upper hand   fanatics   he said to me one day   mean fervour  and  fervour means hard work  and hard work means power   that was the centre  point of all his plotting and scheming     and first of all he set himself to show how excellent a soldier he was   and he spared neither time nor work to make this apparent  from morn  till midday  and from afternoon till night  we drilled and drilled until  in very truth the shouting of the orders and the clatter of the arms  became wearisome to our ears  the good burghers may well have  thought that colonel saxon s wiltshire foot were as much part of the  market place as the town cross or the parish stocks  there was much to  be done in very little time  so much that many would have thought it  hopeless to attempt it  not only was there the general muster of the  regiment  but we had each to practise our own companies in their several  drills  and to learn as best we could the names and the wants of the  men  yet our work was made easier to us by the assurance that it was not  thrown away  for at every gathering our bumpkins stood more erect   and handled their weapons more deftly  from cock crow to sun down the  streets resounded with  poise your muskets  order your muskets  rest  your muskets  handle your primers   and all the other orders of the old  manual exercise     as we became more soldierly we increased in numbers  for our smart  appearance drew the pick of the new comers into our ranks  my own  company swelled until it had to be divided  and others enlarged in  proportion  the baronet s musqueteers mustered a full hundred  skilled  for the most part in the use of the gun  altogether we sprang from  three hundred to four hundred and fifty  and our drill improved until we  received praise from all sides on the state of our men     late in the evening i was riding slowly back to the house of master  timewell when reuben clattered after me  and besought me to turn back  with him to see a noteworthy sight  though feeling little in the mood  for such things  i turned covenant and rode with him down the length of  high street  and into the suburb which is known as shuttern  where my  companion pulled up at a bare barn like building  and bade me look in  through the window     the interior  which consisted of a single great hall  the empty  warehouse in which wool had used to be stored  was all alight with lamps  and candles  a great throng of men  whom i recognised as belonging to  my own company  or that of my companion  lay about on either side  some  smoking  some praying  and some burnishing their arms  down the middle a  line of benches had been drawn up  on which there were seated astraddle  the whole hundred of the baronet s musqueteers  each engaged in plaiting  into a queue the hair of the man who sat in front of him  a boy walked  up and down with a pot of grease  by the aid of which with some whipcord  the work was going forward merrily  sir gervas himself with a great  flour dredger sat perched upon a bale of wool at the head of the line   and as quickly as any queue was finished he examined it through his  quizzing glass  and if it found favour in his eyes  daintily powdered it  from his dredger  with as much care and reverence as though it were some  service of the church  no cook seasoning a dish could have added  his spices with more nicety of judgment than our friend displayed in  whitening the pates of his company  glancing up from his labours he saw  our two smiling faces looking in at him through the window  but his work  was too engrossing to allow him to leave it  and we rode off at last  without having speech with him     by this time the town was very quiet and still  for the folk in those  parts were early bed goers  save when some special occasion kept them  afoot  we rode slowly together through the silent streets  our horses   hoofs ringing out sharp against the cobble stones  talking about such  light matters as engage the mind of youth  the moon was shining very  brightly above us  silvering the broad streets  and casting a fretwork  of shadows from the peaks and pinnacles of the churches  at master  timewell s courtyard i sprang from my saddle  but reuben  attracted by  the peace and beauty of the scene  rode onwards with the intention of  going as far as the town gate     i was still at work upon my girth buckles  undoing my harness  when of  a sudden there came from the street a shouting and a rushing  with the  clinking of blades  and my comrade s voice calling upon me for help   drawing my sword i ran out  some little way down there was a clear  space  white with the moonshine  in the centre of which i caught a  glimpse of the sturdy figure of my friend springing about with an  activity for which i had never given him credit  and exchanging sword  thrusts with three or four men who were pressing him closely  on the  ground there lay a dark figure  and behind the struggling group reuben s  mare reared and plunged in sympathy with her master s peril  as i rushed  down  shouting and waving my sword  the assailants took flight down  a side street  save one  a tall sinewy swordsman  who rushed in upon  reuben  stabbing furiously at him  and cursing him the while for a  spoil sport  to my horror i saw  as i ran  the fellow s blade slip  inside my friend s guard  who threw up his arms and fell prostrate   while the other with a final thrust dashed off down one of the narrow  winding lanes which lead from east street to the banks of the tone      for heaven s sake where are you hurt   i cried  throwing myself upon my  knees beside his prostrate body   where is your injury  reuben       in the wind  mostly   quoth he  blowing like a smithy bellows    likewise on the back of my pate  give me your hand  i pray       and are you indeed scathless   i cried  with a great lightening of  the heart as i helped him to his feet   i thought that the villain had  stabbed you       as well stab a warsash crab with a bodkin   said he   thanks to good  sir jacob clancing  once of snellaby hall and now of salisbury plain   their rapiers did no more than scratch my plate of proof  but how is it  with the maid       the maid   said i      aye  it was to save her that i drew  she was beset by these night  walkers  see  she rises  they threw her down when i set upon them       how is it with you  mistress   i asked  for the prostrate figure  had arisen and taken the form of a woman  young and graceful to all  appearance  with her face muffled in a mantle   i trust that you have  met with no hurt       none  sir   she answered  in a low  sweet voice   but that i have  escaped is due to the ready valour of your friend  and the guiding  wisdom of him who confutes the plots of the wicked  doubtless a true man  would have rendered this help to any damsel in distress  and yet it may  add to your satisfaction to know that she whom you have served is no  stranger to you   with these words she dropped her mantle and turned her  face towards us in the moonlight      good lack  it is mistress timewell   i cried  in amazement      let us homewards   she said  in firm  quick tones   the neighbours are  alarmed  and there will be a rabble collected anon  let us escape from  the babblement      windows had indeed begun to clatter up in every direction  and loud  voices to demand what was amiss  far away down the street we could  see the glint of lanthorns swinging to and fro as the watch hurried  thitherwards  we slipped along in the shadow  however  and found  ourselves safe within the mayor s courtyard without let or hindrance      i trust  sir  that you have really met with no hurt   said the maiden  to my companion     reuben had said not a word since she had uncovered her face  and bore  the face of a man who finds himself in some pleasant dream and is vexed  only by the fear lest he wake up from it   nay  i am not hurt   he  answered   but i would that you could tell us who these roving blades  may be  and where they may be found       nay  nay   said she  with uplifted finger   you shall not follow the  matter further  as to the men  i cannot say with certainty who they  may have been  i had gone forth to visit dame clatworthy  who hath the  tertian ague  and they did beset me on my return  perchance they are  some who are not of my grandfather s way of thinking in affairs of  state  and who struck at him through me  but ye have both been so kind  that ye will not refuse me one other favour which i shall ask ye      we protested that we could not  with our hands upon our sword hilts      nay  keep them for the lord s quarrel   said she  smiling at the  action   all that i ask is that ye will say nothing if this matter to my  grandsire  he is choleric  and a little matter doth set him in a flame   so old as he is  i would not have his mind turned from the public needs  to a private trifle of this sort  have i your promises       mine   said i  bowing      and mine   said lockarby      thanks  good friends  alack  i have dropped my gauntlet in the street   but it is of no import  i thank god that no harm has come to any one  my  thanks once more  and may pleasant dreams await ye   she sprang up the  steps and was gone in an instant     reuben and i unharnessed our horses and saw them cared for in silence   we then entered the house and ascended to our chambers  still without a  word  outside his room door my friend paused      i have heard that long man s voice before  micah   said he      and so have i   i answered   the old man must beware of his  prentices   i have half a mind to go back for the little maiden s gauntlet      a merry twinkle shot through the cloud which hid gathered on reuben s  brow  he opened his left hand and showed me the doe skin glove crumpled  up in his palm      i would not barter it for all the gold in her grandsire s coffers    said he  with a sudden outflame  and then half laughing  half blushing  at his own heat  he whisked in and left me to my thoughts     and so i learned for the first time  my dears  that my good comrade had  been struck by the little god s arrows  when a man s years number one  score  love springs up in him  as the gourd grew in the scriptures  in a  single night  i have told my story ill if i have not made you understand  that my friend was a frank  warm hearted lad of impulse  whose reason  seldom stood sentry over his inclinations  such a man can no more draw  away from a winning maid than the needle can shun the magnet  he loves  as the mavis sings or the kitten plays  now  a slow witted  heavy fellow  like myself  in whose veins the blood has always flowed somewhat coolly  and temperately  may go into love as a horse goes into a shelving  stream  step by step  but a man like reuben is kicking his heels upon  the bank one moment  and is over ears in the deepest pool the nest     heaven only knows what match it was that had set the tow alight  i can  but say that from that day on my comrade was sad and cloudy one hour   gay and blithesome the next  his even flow of good spirits had deserted  him  and he became as dismal as a moulting chicken  which has ever  seemed to me to be one of the strangest outcomes of what poets have  called the joyous state of love  but  indeed  pain and pleasure are so  very nearly akin in this world  that it is as if they were tethered  in neighbouring stalls  and a kick would at any time bring down the  partition  here is a man who is as full of sighs as a grenade is of  powder  his face is sad  his brow is downcast  his wits are wandering   yet if you remark to him that it is an ill thing that he should be  in this state  he will answer you  as like as not  that he would not  exchange it for all the powers and principalities  tears to him are  golden  and laughter is but base coin  well  my dears  it is useless  for me to expound to you that which i cannot myself understand  if  as i  have heard  it is impossible to get the thumb marks of any two men to  be alike  how can we expect their inmost thoughts and feelings to tally   yet this i can say with all truth  that when i asked your grandmother s  hand i did not demean myself as if i were chief mourner at a funeral   she will bear me out that i walked up to her with a smile upon my face   though mayhap there was a little flutter at my heart  and i took her  hand and i said  but  lack a day  whither have i wandered  what has all  this to do with taunton town and the rising of          on the night of wednesday  june     we learned that the king  as  monmouth was called throughout the west  was lying less than ten miles  off with his forces  and that he would make his entry into the loyal  town of taunton the next morning  every effort was made  as ye may well  guess  to give him a welcome which should be worthy of the most whiggish  and protestant town in england  an arch of evergreens had already  been built up at the western gate  bearing the motto   welcome to king  monmouth   and another spanned the entrance to the market place from the  upper window of the white hart inn  with  hail to the protestant chief    in great scarlet letters  a third  if i remember right  bridged the  entrance to the castle yard  but the motto on it has escaped me  the  cloth and wool industry is  as i have told you  the staple trade of  the town  and the merchants had no mercy on their wares  but used them  freely to beautify the streets  rich tapestries  glossy velvets  and  costly brocades fluttered from the windows or lined the balconies  east  street  high street  and fore street were draped from garret to basement  with rare and beautiful fabrics  while gay flags hung from the roofs  on either side  or fluttered in long festoons from house to house   the royal banner of england floated from the lofty tower of st  mary  magdalene  while the blue ensign of monmouth waved from the sister  turret of st  james  late into the night there was planing and  hammering  working and devising  until when the sun rose upon thursday   june     it shone on as brave a show of bunting and evergreen as ever  graced a town  taunton had changed as by magic from a city into a flower  garden     master stephen timewell had busied himself in these preparations  but he  had borne in mind at the same time that the most welcome sight which  he could present to monmouth s eyes was the large body of armed men who  were prepared to follow his fortunes  there were sixteen hundred in the  town  two hundred of which were horse  mostly well armed and equipped   these were disposed in such a way that the king should pass them in his  progress  the townsmen lined the market place three deep from the  castle gate to the entrance to the high street  from thence to shuttern   dorsetshire  and frome peasants were drawn up on either side of the  street  while our own regiment was stationed at the western gate  with  arms well burnished  serried ranks  and fresh sprigs of green in every  bonnet  no leader could desire a better addition to his army  when  all were in their places  and the burghers and their wives had arrayed  themselves in their holiday gear  with gladsome faces and baskets of  new cut flowers  all was ready for the royal visitor s reception      my orders are   said saxon  riding up to us as we sat our horses reside  our companions   that i and my captains should fall in with the king s  escort as he passes  and so accompany him to the market place  your men  shall present arms  and shall then stand their ground until we return      we all three drew our swords and saluted      if ye will come with me  gentlemen  and take position to the right of  the gate here   said he   i may be able to tell ye something of these  folk as they pass  thirty years of war in many climes should give me the  master craftsman s right to expound to his apprentices      we all very gladly followed his advice  and passed out through the gate   which was now nothing more than a broad gap amongst the mounds which  marked the lines of the old walls   there is no sign of them yet   i  remarked  as we pulled up upon a convenient hillock   i suppose that  they must come by this road which winds through the valley before us       there are two sorts of bad general   quoth saxon   the man who is too  fast and the man who is too slow  his majesty s advisers will never be  accused of the former failing  whatever other mistakes they may fall  into  there was old marshal grunberg  with whom i did twenty six months   soldiering in bohemia  he would fly through the country pell mell   horse  foot  and artillery  as if the devil were at his heels  he might  make fifty blunders  but the enemy had never time to take advantage  i  call to mind a raid which we made into silesia  when  after two days or  so of mountain roads  his oberhauptmann of the staff told him that it  was impossible for the artillery to keep up   lass es hinter   says he   so the guns were left  and by the evening of the next day the foot were  dead beat   they cannot walk another mile   says the oberhauptmann    lassen sie hinter   says he  so on we went with the horse  i was in his  pandour regiment  worse luck  but after a skirmish or two  what with the  roads and what with the enemy  our horses were foundered and useless    the horses are used up   says the oberhauptmann   lassen sie hinter    he cries  and i warrant that he would have pushed on to prague with his  staff  had they allowed him   general hinterlassen  we called him after  that       a dashing commander  too   cried sir gervas   i would fain have served  under him       aye  and he had a way of knocking his recruits into shape which would  scarce be relished by our good friends here in the west country   said  saxon   i remember that after the leaguer of salzburg  when we had taken  the castle or fortalice of that name  we were joined by some thousand  untrained foot  which had been raised in dalmatia in the emperor s  employ  as they approached our lines with waving of hands and blowing of  bugles  old marshal hinterlassen discharged a volley of all the cannon  upon the walls at them  killing three score and striking great panic  into the others   the rogues must get used to standing fire sooner  or later   said he   so they may as well commence their education at  once        he was a rough schoolmaster   i remarked   he might have left that part  of the drill to the enemy       yet his soldiers loved him   said saxon   he was not a man  when a city  had been forced  to inquire into every squawk of a woman  or give ear to  every burgess who chanced to find his strong box a trifle the lighter   but as to the slow commanders  i have known none to equal brigadier  baumgarten  also of the imperial service  he would break up his  winter quarters and sit down before some place of strength  where he  would raise a sconce here  and sink a sap there  until his soldiers were  sick of the very sight of the place  so he would play with it  as a cat  with a mouse  until at last it was about to open its gates  when   as like as not  he would raise the leaguer and march back into his  winter quarters  i served two campaigns under him without honour  sack   plunder  or emolument  save a beggarly stipend of three gulden a day   paid in clipped money  six months in arrear  but mark ye the folk upon  yonder tower  they are waving their kerchiefs as though something were  visible to them       i can see nothing   i answered  shading my eyes and gazing down the  tree sprinkled valley which rose slowly in green uplands to the grassy  blackdown hills      those on the housetops are waving and pointing   said reuben   methinks  i can myself see the flash of steel among yonder woods       there it is   cried saxon  extending his gauntleted hand   on the  western bank of the tone  hard by the wooden bridge  follow my finger   clarke  and see if you cannot distinguish it       yes  truly   i exclaimed   i see a bright shimmer coming and going  and  there to the left  where the road curves over the hill  mark you that  dense mass of men  ha  the head of the column begins to emerge from the  trees      there was not a cloud in the sky  but the great heat had caused a haze  to overlie the valley  gathering thickly along the winding course of  the river  and hanging in little sprays and feathers over the woodlands  which clothe its banks  through this filmy vapour there broke from time  to time fierce sparkles of brilliant light as the sun s rays fell upon  breastplate or headpiece  now and again the gentle summer breeze  wafted up sudden pulses of martial music to our ears  with the blare of  trumpets and the long deep snarl of the drums  as we gazed  the van of  the army began to roll out from the cover of the trees and to darken the  white dusty roads  the long line slowly extended itself  writhing out of  the forest land like a dark snake with sparkling scales  until the whole  rebel army  horse  foot  and ordnance  were visible beneath us  the  gleam of the weapons  the waving of numerous banners  the plumes of the  leaders  and the deep columns of marching men  made up a picture which  stirred the very hearts of the citizens  who  from the housetops and  from the ruinous summit of the dismantled walls  were enabled to gaze  down upon the champions of their faith  if the mere sight of a passing  regiment will cause a thrill in your bosoms  you can fancy how it is  when the soldiers upon whom you look are in actual arms for your own  dearest and most cherished interests  and have just come out victorious  from a bloody struggle  if every other man s hand was against us  these  at least were on our side  and our hearts went out to them as to friends  and brothers  of all the ties that unite men in this world  that of a  common danger is the strongest     it all appeared to be most warlike and most imposing to my inexperienced  eyes  and i thought as i looked at the long array that our cause was as  good as won  to my surprise  however  saxon pished and pshawed under his  breath  until at last  unable to contain his impatience  he broke out in  hot discontent      do but look at that vanguard as they breast the slope   he cried    where is the advance party  or vorreiter  as the germans call them   where  too  is the space which should be left between the fore guard and  the main battle  by the sword of scanderbeg  they remind me more of a  drove of pilgrims  as i have seen them approaching the shrine of st   sebaldus of nurnberg with their banners and streamers  there in  the centre  amid that cavalcade of cavaliers  rides our new monarch  doubtless  pity he hath not a man by him who can put this swarm of  peasants into something like campaign order  now do but look at those  four pieces of ordnance trailing along like lame sheep behind the flock   caracco  i would that i were a young king s officer with a troop of  light horse on the ridge yonder  my faith  how i should sweep down yon  cross road like a kestrel on a brood of young plover  then heh for cut  and thrust  down with the skulking cannoniers  a carbine fire to cover  us  round with the horses  and away go the rebel guns in a cloud of  dust  how s that  sir gervas       good sport  colonel   said the baronet  with a touch of colour in his  white cheeks   i warrant that you did keep your pandours on the trot       aye  the rogues had to work or hang  one or t other  but methinks our  friends here are scarce as numerous as reported  i reckon them to be a  thousand horse  and mayhap five thousand two hundred foot  i have been  thought a good tally man on such occasions  with fifteen hundred in the  town that would bring us to close on eight thousand men  which is no  great force to invade a kingdom and dispute a crown       if the west can give eight thousand  how many can all the counties of  england afford   i asked   is not that the fairer way to look at it       monmouth s popularity lies mostly in the west   saxon answered   it  was the memory of that which prompted him to raise his standard in these  counties       his standards  rather   quoth reuben   why  it looks as though they had  hung their linen up to dry all down the line       true  they have more ensigns than ever i saw with so small a force    saxon answered  rising in his stirrups   one or two are blue  and the  rest  as far as i can see for the sun shining upon them  are white  with  some motto or device      whilst we had been conversing  the body of horse which formed the  vanguard of the protestant army had approached within a quarter of a  mile or less of the town  when a loud  clear bugle call brought them to  a halt  in each successive regiment or squadron the signal was repeated   so that the sound passed swiftly down the long array until it died away  in the distance  as the coil of men formed up upon the white road  with  just a tremulous shifting motion along the curved and undulating line   its likeness to a giant serpent occurred again to my mind      i could fancy it a great boa   i remarked   which was drawing its coils  round the town       a rattlesnake  rather   said reuben  pointing to the guns in the rear    it keeps all its noise in its tail       here comes its head  if i mistake not   quoth saxon   it were best  perhaps that we stand at the side of the gate      as he spoke a group of gaily dressed cavaliers broke away from the main  body and rode straight for the town  their leader was a tall  slim   elegant young man  who sat his horse with the grace of a skilled rider   and who was remarkable amongst those around him for the gallantry of his  bearing and the richness of his trappings  as he galloped towards the  gate a roar of welcome burst from the assembled multitude  which was  taken up and prolonged by the crowds behind  who  though unable to see  what was going forward  gathered from the shouting that the king was  approaching         chapter xx  of the muster of the men of the west    monmouth was at that time in his thirty sixth year  and was remarkable  for those superficial graces which please the multitude and fit a man to  lead in a popular cause  he was young  well spoken  witty  and skilled  in all martial and manly exercises  on his progress in the west he had  not thought it beneath him to kiss the village maidens  to offer prizes  at the rural sports  and to run races in his boots against the fleetest  of the barefooted countrymen   note g   appendix  his nature was vain  and prodigal  but he excelled in that showy magnificence and careless  generosity which wins the hearts of the people  both on the continent  and at bothwell bridge  in scotland  he had led armies with success  and  his kindness and mercy to the covenanters after his victory had caused  him to be as much esteemed amongst the whigs as dalzell and claverhouse  were hated  as he reined up his beautiful black horse at the gate of the  city  and raised his plumed montero cap to the shouting crowd  the grace  and dignity of his bearing were such as might befit the knight errant  in a romance who is fighting at long odds for a crown which a tyrant has  filched from him     he was reckoned well favoured  but i cannot say that i found him so  his  face was  i thought  too long and white for comeliness  yet his features  were high and noble  with well marked nose and clear  searching eyes  in  his mouth might perchance be noticed some trace of that weakness which  marred his character  though the expression was sweet and amiable  he  wore a dark purple roquelaure riding jacket  faced and lapelled with  gold lace  through the open front of which shone a silver breastplate   a velvet suit of a lighter shade than the jacket  a pair of high yellow  cordovan boots  with a gold hilted rapier on one side  and a poniard  of parma on the other  each hung from the morocco leather sword belt   completed his attire  a broad collar of mechlin lace flowed over his  shoulders  while wristbands of the same costly material dangled from his  sleeves  again and again he raised his cap and bent to the saddle bow in  response to the storm of cheering   a monmouth  a monmouth   cried  the people   hail to the protestant chief    long live the noble king  monmouth   while from every window  and roof  and balcony fluttering  kerchief or waving hat brightened the joyous scene  the rebel van caught  fire at the sight and raised a great deep chested shout  which was taken  up again and again by the rest of the army  until the whole countryside  was sonorous     in the meanwhile the city elders  headed by our friend the mayor   advanced from the gate in all the dignity of silk and fur to pay homage  to the king  sinking upon one knee by monmouth s stirrup  he kissed the  hand which was graciously extended to him      nay  good master mayor   said the king  in a clear  strong voice   it  is for my enemies to sink before me  and not for my friends  prythee   what is this scroll which you do unroll       it is an address of welcome and of allegiance  your majesty  from your  loyal town of taunton       i need no such address   said king monmouth  looking round   it is  written all around me in fairer characters than ever found themselves  upon parchment  my good friends have made me feel that i was welcome  without the aid of clerk or scrivener  your name  good master mayor  is  stephen timewell  as i understand       the same  your majesty       too curt a name for so trusty a man   said the king  drawing his sword  and touching him upon the shoulder with it   i shall make it longer by  three letters  rise up  sir stephen  and may i find that there are many  other knights in my dominions as loyal and as stout      amidst the huzzahs which broke out afresh at this honour done to the  town  the mayor withdrew with the councilmen to the left side of the  gate  whilst monmouth with his staff gathered upon the right  at a  signal a trumpeter blew a fanfare  the drums struck up a point of war   and the insurgent army  with serried ranks and waving banners  resumed  its advance upon the town  as it approached  saxon pointed out to us the  various leaders and men of note who surrounded the king  giving us their  names and some few words as to their characters      that is lord grey of wark   said he   the little middle aged lean man  at the king s bridle arm  he hath been in the tower once for treason    twas he who fled with the lady henrietta berkeley  his wife s sister  a  fine leader truly for a godly cause  the man upon his left  with the  red swollen face and the white feather in his cap  is colonel holmes   i trust that he will never show the white feather save on his head  the  other upon the high chestnut horse is a lawyer  though  by my soul  he  is a better man at ordering a battalion than at drawing a bill of costs   he is the republican wade who led the foot at the skirmish at bridport   and brought them off with safety  the tall heavy faced soldier in the  steel bonnet is anthony buyse  the brandenburger  a soldado of fortune   and a man of high heart  as are most of his countrymen  i have fought  both with him and against him ere now       mark ye the long thin man behind him   cried reuben   he hath drawn his  sword  and waves it over his head   tis a strange time and place for the  broadsword exercise  he is surely mad       perhaps you are not far amiss   said saxon   yet  by my hilt  were it  not for that man there would be no protestant army advancing upon us  down yonder road   tis he who by dangling the crown before monmouth s  eyes beguiled him away from his snug retreat in brabant  there is not  one of these men whom he hath not tempted into this affair by some bait  or other  with grey it was a dukedom  with wade the woolsack  with buyse  the plunder of cheapside  every one hath his own motive  but the clues  to them all are in the hands of yonder crazy fanatic  who makes the  puppets dance as he will  he hath plotted more  lied more  and suffered  less than any whig in the party       it must be that dr  robert ferguson of whom i have heard my father  speak   said i      you are right   tis he  i have but seen him once in amsterdam  and yet  i know him by his shock wig and crooked shoulders  it is whispered  that of late his overweening conceit hath unseated his reason  see  the  german places his hand upon his shoulder and persuades him to sheathe  his weapon  king monmouth glances round too  and smiles as though he  were the court buffoon with a geneva cloak instead of the motley  but  the van is upon us  to your companies  and mind that ye raise your  swords to the salute while the colours of each troop go by      whilst our companion had been talking  the whole protestant army had  been streaming towards the town  and the head of the fore guard was  abreast with the gateway  four troops of horse led the way  badly  equipped and mounted  with ropes instead of bridles  and in some cases  squares of sacking in place of saddles  the men were armed for the most  part with sword and pistol  while a few had the buff coats  plates  and  headpieces taken at axminster  still stained sometimes with the blood of  the last wearer  in the midst of them rode a banner bearer  who carried  a great square ensign hung upon a pole  which was supported upon a  socket let into the side of the girth  upon it was printed in golden  letters the legend   pro libertate et religione nostra   these  horse soldiers were made up of yeomen s and farmers  sons  unused to  discipline  and having a high regard for themselves as volunteers  which  caused them to cavil and argue over every order  for this cause  though  not wanting in natural courage  they did little service during the war   and were a hindrance rather than a help to the army     behind the horse came the foot  walking six abreast  divided into  companies of varying size  each company bearing a banner which gave the  name of the town or village from which it had been raised  this manner  of arranging the troops had been chosen because it had been found to be  impossible to separate men who were akin and neighbours to each other   they would fight  they said  side by side  or they would not fight at  all  for my own part  i think that it is no bad plan  for when it comes  to push of pike  a man stands all the faster when he knows that he  hath old and tried friends on either side of him  many of these country  places i came to know afterwards from the talk of the men  and many  others i have travelled through  so that the names upon the banners have  come to have a real meaning with me  homer hath  i remember  a chapter  or book wherein he records the names of all the grecian chiefs and  whence they came  and how many men they brought to the common muster  it  is pity that there is not some western homer who could record the names  of these brave peasants and artisans  and recount what each did or  suffered in upholding a noble though disastrous cause  their places of  birth at least shall not be lost as far as mine own feeble memory can  carry me     the first foot regiment  if so rudely formed a band could be so called   consisted of men of the sea  fishers and coastmen  clad in the  heavy blue jerkins and rude garb of their class  they were bronzed   weather beaten tarpaulins  with hard mahogany faces  variously armed  with birding pieces  cutlasses  or pistols  i have a notion that it  was not the first time that those weapons had been turned against  king james s servants  for the somerset and devon coasts were famous  breeding places for smugglers  and many a saucy lugger was doubtless  lying up in creek or in bay whilst her crew had gone a soldiering to  taunton  as to discipline  they had no notion of it  but rolled along in  true blue water style  with many a shout and halloo to each other or to  the crowd  from star point to portland roads there would be few nets  for many weeks to come  and fish would swim the narrow seas which should  have been heaped on lyme cobb or exposed for sale in plymouth market   each group  or band  of these men of the sea bore with it its own  banner  that of lyme in the front  followed by topsham  colyford   bridport  sidmouth  otterton  abbotsbury  and charmouth  all southern  towns  which are on or near the coast  so they trooped past us  rough  and careless  with caps cocked  and the reek of their tobacco rising  up from them like the steam from a tired horse  in number they may have  been four hundred or thereabouts     the peasants of rockbere  with flail and scythe  led the next column   followed by the banner of honiton  which was supported by two hundred  stout lacemakers from the banks of the otter  these men showed by the  colour of their faces that their work kept them within four walls  yet  they excelled their peasant companions in their alert and soldierly  bearing  indeed  with all the troops  we observed that  though the  countrymen were the stouter and heartier  the craftsmen were the most  ready to catch the air and spirit of the camp  behind the men of honiton  came the puritan clothworkers of wellington  with their mayor upon  a white horse beside their standard bearer  and a band of twenty  instruments before him  grim visaged  thoughtful  sober men  they were  for the most part clad in grey suits and wearing broad brimmed hats    for god and faith  was the motto of a streamer which floated from  amongst them  the clothworkers formed three strong companies  and the  whole regiment may have numbered close on six hundred men     the third regiment was headed by five hundred foot from taunton  men  of peaceful and industrious life  but deeply imbued with those great  principles of civil and religious liberty which were three years later  to carry all before them in england  as they passed the gates they were  greeted by a thunderous welcome from their townsmen upon the walls and  at the windows  their steady  solid ranks  and broad  honest burgher  faces  seemed to me to smack of discipline and of work well done  behind  them came the musters of winterbourne  ilminster  chard  yeovil  and  collumpton  a hundred or more pikesmen to each  bringing the tally of  the regiment to a thousand men     a squadron of horse trotted by  closely followed by the fourth regiment   bearing in its van the standards of beaminster  crewkerne  langport   and chidiock  all quiet somersetshire villages  which had sent out their  manhood to strike a blow for the old cause  puritan ministers  with  their steeple hats and geneva gowns  once black  but now white with  dust  marched sturdily along beside their flocks  then came a strong  company of wild half armed shepherds from the great plains which extend  from the blackdowns on the south to the mendips on the north  very  different fellows  i promise you  from the corydons and strephons of  master waller or master dryden  who have depicted the shepherd as ever  shedding tears of love  and tootling upon a plaintive pipe  i fear that  chloe or phyllis would have met with rough wooing at the hands of these  western savages  behind them were musqueteers from dorchester  pikemen  from newton poppleford  and a body of stout infantry from among the  serge workers of ottery st  mary  this fourth regiment numbered rather  better than eight hundred  but was inferior in arms and in discipline to  that which preceded it     the fifth regiment was headed by a column of fen men from the dreary  marches which stretch round athelney  these men  in their sad and sordid  dwellings  had retained the same free and bold spirit which had made  them in past days the last resource of the good king alfred and the  protectors of the western shires from the inroads of the danes  who  were never able to force their way into their watery strongholds  two  companies of them  towsy headed and bare legged  but loud in hymn and  prayer  had come out from their fastnesses to help the protestant cause   at their heels came the woodmen and lumberers of bishop s lidiard  big   sturdy men in green jerkins  and the white smocked villagers of huish  champflower  the rear of the regiment was formed by four hundred men in  scarlet coats  with white cross belts and well burnished muskets   these were deserters from the devonshire militia  who had marched with  albemarle from exeter  and who had come over to monmouth on the field  at axminster  these kept together in a body  but there were many other  militiamen  both in red and in yellow coats  amongst the various bodies  which i have set forth  this regiment may have numbered seven hundred  men     the sixth and last column of foot was headed by a body of peasants  bearing  minehead  upon their banner  and the ensign of the three  wool bales and the sailing ship  which is the sign of that ancient  borough  they had come for the most part from the wild country which  lies to the north of dunster castle and skirts the shores of the bristol  channel  behind them were the poachers and huntsmen of porlock quay  who  had left the red deer of exmoor to graze in peace whilst they followed  a nobler quarry  they were followed by men from dulverton  men from  milverton  men from wiveliscombe and the sunny slopes of the quantocks   swart  fierce men from the bleak moors of dunkerry beacon  and tall   stalwart pony rearers and graziers from bampton  the banners of  bridgewater  of shepton mallet  and of nether stowey swept past us  with  that of the fishers of clovelly and the quarrymen of the blackdowns  in  the rear were three companies of strange men  giants in stature  though  somewhat bowed with labour  with long tangled beards  and unkempt hair  hanging over their eyes  these were the miners from the mendip hills and  from the oare and bagworthy valleys  rough  half savage men  whose eyes  rolled up at the velvets and brocades of the shouting citizens  or fixed  themselves upon their smiling dames with a fierce intensity which scared  the peaceful burghers  so the long line rolled in until three squadrons  of horse and four small cannon  with the blue coated dutch cannoniers as  stiff as their own ramrods  brought up the rear  a long train of carts  and of waggons which had followed the army were led into the fields  outside the walls and there quartered     when the last soldier had passed through the shuttern gate  monmouth and  his leaders rode slowly in  the mayor walking by the king s charger   as we saluted they all faced round to us  and i saw a quick flush of  surprise and pleasure come over monmouth s pale face as he noted our  close lines and soldierly bearing      by my faith  gentlemen   he said  glancing round at his staff   our  worthy friend the mayor must have inherited cadmus s dragon teeth  where  raised ye this pretty crop  sir stephen  how came ye to bring them  to such perfection too  even  i declare  to the hair powder of the  grenadiers       i have fifteen hundred in the town   the old wool worker answered  proudly   though some are scarce as disciplined     these men come from wiltshire  and the officers from hampshire  as to  their order  the credit is due not to me  but to the old soldier colonel  decimus saxon  whom they have chosen as their commander  as well as to  the captains who serve under him       my thanks are due to you  colonel   said the king  turning to saxon   who bowed and sank the point of his sword to the earth   and to you  also  gentlemen  i shall not forget the warm loyalty which brought you  from hampshire in so short a time  would that i could find the same  virtue in higher places  but  colonel saxon  you have  i gather  seen  much service abroad  what think you of the army which hath just passed  before you       if it please your majesty   saxon answered   it is like so much  uncarded wool  which is rough enough in itself  and yet may in time come  to be woven into a noble garment       hem  there is not much leisure for the weaving   said monmouth   but  they fight well  you should have seen them fall on at axminster  we hope  to see you and to hear your views at the council table  but how is this   have i not seen this gentleman s face before       it is the honourable sir gervas jerome of the county of surrey   quoth  saxon      your majesty may have seen me at st  james s   said the baronet   raising his hat   or in the balcony at whitehall  i was much at court  during the latter years of the late king       yes  yes  i remember the name as well as the face   cried monmouth    you see  gentlemen   he continued  turning to his staff   the courtiers  begin to come in at last  were you not the man who did fight sir thomas  killigrew behind dunkirk house  i thought as much  will you not attach  yourself to my personal attendants       if it please your majesty   sir gervas answered   i am of opinion  that i could do your royal cause better service at the head of my  musqueteers       so be it  so be it   said king monmouth  setting spurs to his horse  he  raised his hat in response to the cheers of the troops and cantered down  the high street under a rain of flowers  which showered from roof and  window upon him  his staff  and his escort  we had joined in his train   as commanded  so that we came in for our share of this merry crossfire   one rose as it fluttered down was caught by reuben  who  i observed   pressed it to his lips  and then pushed it inside his breastplate   glancing up  i caught sight  of the smiling face of our host s daughter  peeping down at us from a casement      well caught  reuben   i whispered   at trick track or trap and ball you  were ever our best player       ah  micah   said he   i bless the day that ever i followed you to the  wars  i would not change places with monmouth this day       has it gone so far then   i exclaimed   why  lad  i thought that you  were but opening your trenches  and you speak as though you had carried  the city       perhaps i am over hopeful   he cried  turning from hot to cold  as a  man doth when he is in love  or hath the tertian ague  or other bodily  trouble   god knows that i am little worthy of her  and yet        set not your heart too firmly upon that which may prove to be beyond  your reach   said i   the old man is rich  and will look higher       i would he were poor   sighed reuben  with all the selfishness of a  lover   if this war last i may win myself some honour or title  who  knows  others have done it  and why not i       of our three from havant   i remarked   one is spurred onwards by  ambition  and one by love  now  what am i to do who care neither for  high office nor for the face of a maid  what is to carry me into the  fight       our motives come and go  but yours is ever with you   said reuben    honour and duty are the two stars  micah  by which you have ever  steered your course       faith  mistress ruth has taught you to make pretty speeches   said i    but methinks she ought to be here amid the beauty of taunton      as i spoke we were riding into the market place  which was now crowded  with our troops  round the cross were grouped a score of maidens clad in  white muslin dresses with blue scarfs around their waists  as the king  approached  these little maids  with much pretty nervousness  advanced  to meet him  and handed him a banner which they had worked for him  and  also a dainty gold clasped bible  monmouth handed the flag to one of his  captains  but he raised the book above his head  exclaiming that he  had come there to defend the truths contained within it  at which the  cheerings and acclamations broke forth with redoubled vigour  it had  been expected that he might address the people from the cross  but he  contented himself with waiting while the heralds proclaimed his titles  to the crown  when he gave the word to disperse  and the troops marched  off to the different centres where food had been provided for them  the  king and his chief officers took up their quarters in the castle  while  the mayor and richer burgesses found bed and board for the rest  as to  the common soldiers  many were billeted among the townsfolk  many others  encamped in the streets and castle grounds  while the remainder took up  their dwelling among the waggons in the fields outside the city  where  they lit up great fires  and had sheep roasting and beer flowing as  merrily as though a march on london were but a holiday outing         chapter xxi  of my hand grips with the brandenburger    king monmouth had called a council meeting for the evening  and summoned  colonel decimus saxon to attend it  with whom i went  bearing with me  the small package which sir jacob clancing had given over to my keeping   on arriving at the castle we found that the king had not yet come out  from his chamber  but we were shown into the great hall to await him  a  fine room with lofty windows and a noble ceiling of carved woodwork  at  the further end the royal arms had been erected without the bar sinister  which monmouth had formerly worn  here were assembled the principal  chiefs of the army  with many of the inferior commanders  town officers   and others who had petitions to offer  lord grey of wark stood silently  by the window  looking out over the countryside with a gloomy face  wade  and holmes shook their heads and whispered in a corner  ferguson strode  about with his wig awry  shouting out exhortations and prayers in a  broad scottish accent  a few of the more gaily dressed gathered round  the empty fireplace  and listened to a tale from one of their number  which appeared to be shrouded in many oaths  and which was greeted with  shouts of laughter  in another corner a numerous group of zealots  clad  in black or russet gowns  with broad white bands and hanging mantles   stood round some favourite preacher  and discussed in an undertone  calvinistic philosophy and its relation to statecraft  a few plain  homely soldiers  who were neither sectaries nor courtiers  wandered up  and down  or stared out through the windows at the busy encampment upon  the castle green  to one of these  remarkable for his great size and  breadth of shoulder  saxon led me  and touching him on the sleeve  he  held out his hand as to an old friend   mein gott   cried the german  soldier of fortune  for it was the same man whom my companion had  pointed out in the morning   i thought it was you  saxon  when i saw you  by the gate  though you are even thinner than of old  how a man could  suck up so much good bavarian beer as you have done  and yet make so  little flesh upon it  is more than i can verstehen  how have all things  gone with you       as of old   said saxon   more blows than thalers  and greater need of  a surgeon than of a strong box  when did i see you last  friend  was  it not at the onfall at nurnberg  when i led the right and you the left  wing of the heavy horse       nay   said buyse   i have met you in the way of business since then   have you forgot the skirmish on the rhine bank  when you did flash your  snapphahn at me  sapperment  had some rascally schelm not stabbed my  horse i should have swept your head off as a boy cuts thistles mit a  stick       aye  aye   saxon answered composedly   i had forgot it  you were taken   if i remember aright  but did afterwards brain the sentry with your  fetters  and swam the rhine under the fire of a regiment  yet  i think  that we did offer you the same terms that you were having with the  others       some such base offer was indeed made me   said the german sternly   to  which i answered that  though i sold my sword  i did not sell my honour   it is well that cavaliers of fortune should show that an engagement is  with them  how do ye say it   unbreakable until the war is over  then by  all means let him change his paymaster  warum nicht       true  friend  true   replied saxon   these beggarly italians and swiss  have made such a trade of the matter  and sold themselves so freely   body and soul  to the longest purse  that it is well that we should be  nice upon points of honour  but you remember the old hand grip which no  man in the palatinate could exchange with you  here is my captain  micah  clarke  let him see how warm a north german welcome may be      the brandenburger showed his white teeth in a grin as he held out his  broad brown hand to me  the instant that mine was enclosed in it he  suddenly bent his whole strength upon it  and squeezed my fingers  together until the blood tingled in the nails  and the whole hand was  limp and powerless      donnerwetter   he cried  laughing heartily at my start of pain and  surprise   it is a rough prussian game  and the english lads have not  much stomach for it       truly  sir   said i   it is the first time that i have seen the  pastime  and i would fain practise it under so able a master       what  another   he cried   why  you must be still pringling from the  first  nay  if you will i shall not refuse you  though i fear it may  weaken your hold upon your sword hilt      he held out his hand as he spoke  and i grasped it firmly  thumb to  thumb  keeping my elbow high so as to bear all my force upon it  his own  trick was  as i observed  to gain command of the other hand by a great  output of strength at the onset  this i prevented by myself putting out  all my power  for a minute or more we stood motionless  gazing into each  other s faces  then i saw a bead of sweat trickle down his forehead  and  i knew that he was beaten  slowly his grip relaxed  and his hand grew  limp and slack while my own tightened ever upon it  until he was forced  in a surly  muttering voice to request that i should unhand him      teufel und hexerei   he cried  wiping away the blood which oozed from  under his nails   i might as well put my fingers in a rat trap  you  are the first man that ever yet exchanged fair hand grips with anthony  buyse       we breed brawn in england as well as in brandenburg   said saxon  who  was shaking with laughter over the german soldier s discomfiture   why   i have seen that lad pick up a full size sergeant of dragoons and throw  him into a cart as though he had been a clod of earth       strong he is   grumbled buyse  still wringing his injured hand   strong  as old gotz mit de iron grip  but what good is strength alone in the  handling of a weapon  it is not the force of a blow  but the way in  which it is geschlagen  that makes the effect  your sword now is heavier  than mine  by the look of it  and yet my blade would bite deeper  eh  is  not that a more soldierly sport than kinderspiel such as hand grasping  and the like       he is a modest youth   said saxon   yet i would match his stroke  against yours       for what   snarled the german      for as much wine as we can take at a sitting      no small amount  either   said buyse   a brace of gallons at the least   well  be it so  do you accept the contest       i shall do what i may   i answered   though i can scarce hope to strike  as heavy a blow as so old and tried a soldier       henker take your compliments   he cried gruffly   it was with sweet  words that you did coax my fingers into that fool catcher of yours  now   here is my old headpiece of spanish steel  it has  as you can see  one  or two dints of blows  and a fresh one will not hurt it  i place it here  upon this oaken stool high enough to be within fair sword sweep  have at  it  junker  and let us see if you can leave your mark upon it       do you strike first  sir   said i   since the challenge is yours       i must bruise my own headpiece to regain my soldierly credit   he  grumbled   well  well  it has stood a cut or two in its day   drawing  his broadsword  he waved back the crowd who had gathered around us   while he swung the great weapon with tremendous force round his head   and brought it down with a full  clean sweep on to the smooth cap of  steel  the headpiece sprang high into the air and then clattered down  upon the oaken floor with a long  deep line bitten into the solid metal      well struck    a brave stroke   cried the spectators   it is proof  steel thrice welded  and warranted to turn a sword blade   one remarked   raising up the helmet to examine it  and then replacing it upon the  stool      i have seen my father cut through proof steel with this very sword    said i  drawing the fifty year old weapon   he put rather more of his  weight into it than you have done  i have heard him say that a good  stroke should come from the back and loins rather than from the mere  muscles of the arm       it is not a lecture we want  but a beispiel or example   sneered the  german   it is with your stroke that we have to do  and not with the  teaching of your father       my stroke   said i   is in accordance with his teaching   and   whistling round the sword  i brought it down with all my might and  strength upon the german s helmet  the good old commonwealth blade shore  through the plate of steel  cut the stool asunder  and buried its point  two inches deep in the oaken floor   it is but a trick   i explained   i  have practised it in the winter evenings at home       it is not a trick that i should care to have played upon me   said lord  grey  amid a general murmur of applause and surprise   od s bud  man   you have lived two centuries too late  what would not your thews have  been worth before gunpowder put all men upon a level       wunderbar   growled buyse   wunderbar  i am past my prime  young sir   and may well resign the palm of strength to you  it was a right noble  stroke  it hath cost me a runlet or two of canary  and a good old  helmet  but i grudge it not  for it was fairly done  i am thankful  that my head was not darin  saxon  here  used to show us some brave  schwertspielerei  but he hath not the weight for such smashing blows as  this       my eye is still true and my hand firm  though both are perhaps a trifle  the worse for want of use   said saxon  only too glad at the chance  of drawing the eyes of the chiefs upon him   at backsword  sword and  dagger  sword and buckler  single falchion and case of falchions  mine  old challenge still holds good against any comer  save only my brother  quartus  who plays as well as i do  but hath an extra half inch in reach  which gives him the vantage       i studied sword play under signor contarini of paris   said lord grey    who was your master       i have studied  my lord  under signer stern necessity of europe   quoth  saxon   for five and thirty years my life has depended from day to day  upon being able to cover myself with this slip of steel  here is a  small trick which showeth some nicety of eye  to throw this ring to the  ceiling and catch it upon a rapier point  it seems simple  perchance   and yet is only to be attained by some practice       simple   cried wade the lawyer  a square faced  bold eyed man   why   the ring is but the girth of your little finger  a man might do it once  by good luck  but none could ensure it       i will lay a guinea a thrust on it   said saxon  and tossing the little  gold circlet up into the air  he flashed out his rapier and made a pass  at it  the ring rasped down the steel blade and tinkled against the  hilt  fairly impaled  by a sharp motion of the wrist he shot it up  to the ceiling again  where it struck a carved rafter and altered its  course  but again  with a quick step forward  he got beneath it and  received it on his sword point   surely there is some cavalier present  who is as apt at the trick as i am   he said  replacing the ring upon  his finger      i think  colonel  that i could venture upon it   said a voice  and  looking round  we found that monmouth had entered the room and was  standing quietly on the outskirts of the throng  unperceived in  the general interest which our contention had excited   nay  nay   gentlemen   he continued pleasantly  as we uncovered and bowed with  some little embarrassment   how could my faithful followers be better  employed than by breathing themselves in a little sword play  i prythee  lend me your rapier  colonel   he drew a diamond ring from his finger   and spinning it up into the air  he transfixed it as deftly as saxon  had done   i practised the trick at the hague  where  by my faith  i had  only too many hours to devote to such trifles  but how come these steel  links and splinters of wood to be littered over the floor       a son of anak hath appaired amang us   said ferguson  turning his  face  all scarred and reddened with the king s evil  in my direction   a  goliath o  gath  wha hath a stroke like untae a weaver s beam  hath he  no the smooth face o  a bairn and the thews  o  behemoth       a shrewd blow indeed   king monmouth remarked  picking up half the  stool   how is our champion named       he is my captain  your majesty   saxon answered  resheathing the sword  which the king had handed to him   micah clarke  a man of hampshire  birth       they breed a good old english stock in those parts   said monmouth    but how comes it that you are here  sir  i summoned this meeting for my  own immediate household  and for the colonels of the regiments  if every  captain is to be admitted into our councils  we must hold our meetings  on the castle green  for no apartment could contain us       i ventured to come here  your majesty   i replied   because on my way  hither i received a commission  which was that i should deliver this  small but weighty package into your hands  i therefore thought it my  duty to lose no time in fulfilling my errand       what is in it   he asked      i know not   i answered     doctor ferguson whispered a few words into the king s ear  who laughed  and held out his hand for the packet      tut  tut   said he   the days of the borgias and the medicis are over   doctor  besides  the lad is no italian conspirator  but hath honest blue  eyes and flaxen hair as nature s certificate to his character  this  is passing heavy  an ingot of lead  by the feel  lend me your dagger   colonel holmes  it is stitched round with packthread  ha  it is a bar  of gold  solid virgin gold by all that is wonderful  take charge of it   wade  and see that it is added to the common fund  this little piece  of metal may furnish ten pikemen  what have we here  a letter and an  enclosure   to james  duke of monmouth   hum  it was written before we  assumed our royal state   sir jacob glancing  late of snellaby hall   sends greeting and a pledge of affection  carry out the good work   a hundred more such ingots await you when you have crossed salisbury  plain   bravely promised  sir jacob  i would that you had sent them   well  gentlemen  ye see how support and tokens of goodwill come pouring  in upon us  is not the tide upon the turn  can the usurper hope to hold  his own  will his men stand by him  within a month or less i shall see  ye all gathered round me at westminster  and no duty will then be  so pleasing to me as to see that ye are all  from the highest to the  lowest  rewarded for your loyalty to your monarch in this the hour of  his darkness and his danger      a murmur of thanks rose up from the courtiers at this gracious speech   but the german plucked at saxon s sleeve and whispered   he hath his  warm fit upon him  you shall see him cold anon       fifteen hundred men have joined me here where i did but expect a  thousand at the most   the king continued   if we had high hopes when  we landed at lyme cobb with eighty at our back  what should we think now  when we find ourselves in the chief city of somerset with eight thousand  brave men around us   tis but one other affair like that at axminster   and my uncle s power will go down like a house of cards  but gather  round the table  gentlemen  and we shall discuss matters in due form       there is yet a scrap of paper which you have not read  sire   said  wade  picking up a little slip which had been enclosed in the note      it is a rhyming catch or the posy of a ring   said monmouth  glancing  at it   what are we to make of this                when thy star is in trine              between darkness and shine              duke monmouth  duke monmouth              beware of the rhine      thy star in trine  what tomfoolery is this       if it please your majesty   said i   i have reason to believe that the  man who sent you this message is one of those who are deeply skilled  in the arts of divination  and who pretend from the motions of the  celestial bodies to foretell the fates of men       this gentleman is right  sir   remarked lord grey    thy star in trine   is an astrological term  which signifieth when your natal planet shall  be in a certain quarter of the heavens  the verse is of the nature of a  prophecy  the chaldeans and egyptians of old are said to have attained  much skill in the art  but i confess that i have no great opinion of  those latter day prophets who busy themselves in answering the foolish  questions of every housewife                 and tell by venus and the moon              who stole a thimble or a spoon    muttered saxon  quoting from his favourite poem      why  here are our colonels catching the rhyming complaint   said the  king  laughing   we shall be dropping the sword and taking to the harp  anon  as alfred did in these very parts  or i shall become a king of  bards and trouveurs  like good king rene of provence  but  gentlemen   if this be indeed a prophecy  it should  methinks  bode well for our  enterprise  it is true that i am warned against the rhine  but there is  little prospect of our fighting this quarrel upon its banks       worse luck   murmured the german  under his breath      we may  therefore  thank this sir jacob and his giant messenger for  his forecast as well as for his gold  but here comes the worthy mayor of  taunton  the oldest of our councillors and the youngest of our knights   captain clarke  i desire you to stand at the inside of the door and to  prevent intrusion  what passes amongst us will  i am well convinced  be  safe in your keeping      i bowed and took up my post as ordered  while the council men and  commanders gathered round the great oaken table which ran down the  centre of the hall  the mellow evening light was streaming through the  three western windows  while the distant babble of the soldiers upon the  castle green sounded like the sleepy drone of insects  monmouth paced  with quick uneasy steps up and down the further end of the room until  all were seated  when he turned towards them and addressed them      you will have surmised  gentlemen   he said   that i have called you  together to day that i might have the benefit of your collective wisdom  in determining what our next steps should be  we have now marched some  forty miles into our kingdom  and we have met wherever we have gone with  the warm welcome which we expected  close upon eight thousand men follow  our standards  and as many more have been turned away for want of  arms  we have twice met the enemy  with the effect that we have armed  ourselves with their muskets and field pieces  from first to last there  hath been nothing which has not prospered with us  we must look to it  that the future be as successful as the past  to insure this i have  called ye together  and i now ask ye to give me your opinions of our  situation  leaving me after i have listened to your views to form our  plan of action  there are statesmen among ye  and there are soldiers  among ye  and there are godly men among ye who may chance to get a flash  of light when statesman and soldier are in the dark  speak fearlessly   then  and let me know what is in your minds      from my central post by the door i could see the lines of faces on  either side of the board  the solemn close shaven puritans  sunburned  soldiers  and white wigged moustachioed courtiers  my eyes rested  particularly upon ferguson s scorbutic features  saxon s hard aquiline  profile  the german s burly face  and the peaky thoughtful countenance  of the lord of wark      if naebody else will gie an opeenion   cried the fanatical doctor    i ll een speak mysel  as led by the inward voice  for have i no worked  in the cause and slaved in it  much enduring and suffering mony things  at the honds o  the froward  whereby my ain speerit hath plentifully  fructified  have i no been bruised as in a wine press  and cast oot wi   hissing and scorning into waste places       we know your merits and your sufferings  doctor   said the king   the  question before us is as to our course of action       was there no a voice heard in the east   cried the old whig   was there  no a soond as o  a great crying  the crying for a broken covenant and a  sinful generation  whence came the cry  wha s was the voice  was it no  that o  the man robert ferguson  wha raised himsel  up against the great  ones in the land  and wouldna be appeased       aye  aye  doctor   said monmouth impatiently   speak to the point  or  give place to another       i shall mak  mysel  clear  your majesty  have we no heard that argyle  is cutten off  and why was he cutten off  because he hadna due faith  in the workings o  the almighty  and must needs reject the help o  the  children o  light in favour o  the bare legged spawn o  prelacy  wha are  half pagan  half popish  had he walked in the path o  the lord he wudna  be lying in the tolbooth o  edinburgh wi  the tow or the axe before  him  why did he no gird up his loins and march straight onwards wi   the banner o  light  instead o  dallying here and biding there like a  half hairted didymus  and the same or waur will fa  upon us if we dinna  march on intae the land and plant our ensigns afore the wicked toun o   london  the toun where the lord s wark is tae be done  and the tares tae  be separated frae the wheat  and piled up for the burning       your advice  in short  is that we march on   said monmouth      that we march on  your majesty  and that we prepare oorselves tae be  the vessels o  grace  and forbear frae polluting the cause o  the gospel  by wearing the livery o  the devil   here he glared at a gaily attired  cavalier at the other side of the table   or by the playing o  cairds   the singing o  profane songs and the swearing o  oaths  all which are  nichtly done by members o  this army  wi  the effect o  giving much  scandal tae god s ain folk      a hum of assent and approval rose up from the more puritan members of  the council at this expression of opinion  while the courtiers glanced  at each other and curled their lips in derision  monmouth took two or  three turns and then called for another opinion      you  lord grey   he said   are a soldier and a man of experience  what  is your advice  should we halt here or push forward towards london       to advance to the east would  in my humble judgment  be fatal to us    grey answered  speaking slowly  with the manner of a man who has thought  long and deeply before delivering an opinion   james stuart is strong  in horse  and we have none  we can hold our own amongst hedgerows or in  broken country  but what chance could we have in the middle of salisbury  plain  with the dragoons round us we should be like a flock of sheep  amid a pack of wolves  again  every step which we take towards london  removes us from our natural vantage ground  and from the fertile country  which supplies our necessities  while it strengthens our enemy by  shortening the distance he has to convey his troops and his victuals   unless  therefore  we hear of some great outbreak elsewhere  or of some  general movement in london in our favour  we would do best to hold our  ground and wait an attack       you argue shrewdly and well  my lord grey   said the king   but how  long are we to wait for this outbreak which never comes  and for this  support which is ever promised and never provided  we have now been  seven long days in england  and during that time of all the house of  commons no single man hath come over to us  and of the lords none gave  my lord grey  who was himself an exile  not a baron or an earl  and only  one baronet  hath taken up arms for me  where are the men whom danvers  and wildman promised me from london  where are the brisk boys of the  city who were said to be longing for me  where are the breakings out  from berwick to portland which they foretold  not a man hath moved  save only these good peasants  i have been deluded  ensnared   trapped  trapped by vile agents who have led me into the shambles   he  paced up and down  wringing his hands and biting his lips  with despair  stamped upon his face  i observed that buyse smiled and whispered  something to saxon  a hint  i suppose  that this was the cold fit of  which he spoke      tell me  colonel buyse   said the king  mastering his emotion by a  strong effort   do you  as a soldier  agree with my lord grey       ask saxon  your majesty   the german answered   my opinion in a  raths versammlung is  i have observed  ever the same as his       then we turn to you  colonel saxon   said monmouth   we have in this  council a party who are in favour of an advance and a party who wish  to stand their ground  their weight and numbers are  methinks  nearly  equal  if you had the casting vote how would you decide   all eyes were  bent upon our leader  for his martial bearing  and the respect shown to  him by the veteran buyse  made it likely that his opinion might really  turn the scale  he sat for a few moments in silence with his hands  before his face      i will give my opinion  your majesty   he said at last   feversham and  churchill are making for salisbury with three thousand foot  and they  have pushed on eight hundred of the blue guards  and two or three  dragoon regiments  we should  therefore  as lord grey says  have to  fight on salisbury plain  and our foot armed with a medley of weapons  could scarce make head against their horse  all is possible to the lord   as dr  ferguson wisely says  we are as grains of dust in the hollow of  his hand  yet he hath given us brains wherewith to choose the better  course  and if we neglect it we must suffer the consequence of our  folly      ferguson laughed contemptuously  and breathed out a prayer  but many of  the other puritans nodded their heads to acknowledge that this was not  an unreasonable view to take of it      on the other hand  sire   saxon continued   it appears to me that to  remain here is equally impossible  your majesty s friends throughout  england would lose all heart if the army lay motionless and struck no  blow  the rustics would flock off to their wives and homes  such an  example is catching  i have seen a great army thaw away like an icicle  in the sunshine  once gone  it is no easy matter to collect them again   to keep them we must employ them  never let them have an idle minute   drill them  march them  exercise them  work them  preach to them  make  them obey god and their colonel  this cannot be done in snug quarters   they must travel  we cannot hope to end this business until we get  to london  london  then  must be our goal  but there are many ways of  reaching it  you have  sire  as i have heard  many friends at bristol  and in the midlands  if i might advise  i should say let us march round  in that direction  every day that passes will serve to swell your forces  and improve your troops  while all will feel something is astirring   should we take bristol  and i hear that the works are not very  strong  it would give us a very good command of shipping  and a rare  centre from which to act  if all goes well with us  we could make  our way to london through gloucestershire and worcestershire  in the  meantime i might suggest that a day of fast and humiliation be called to  bring down a blessing on the cause      this address  skilfully compounded of worldly wisdom and of spiritual  zeal  won the applause of the whole council  and especially that of king  monmouth  whose melancholy vanished as if by magic      by my faith  colonel   said he   you make it all as clear as day   of course  if we make ourselves strong in the west  and my uncle is  threatened with disaffection elsewhere  he will have no chance to hold  out against us  should he wish to fight us upon our own ground  he must  needs drain his troops from north  south  and east  which is not to be  thought of  we may very well march to london by way of bristol       i think that the advice is good   lord grey observed   but i should  like to ask colonel saxon what warrant he hath for saying that churchill  and feversham are on their way  with three thousand regular foot and  several regiments of horse       the word of an officer of the blues with whom i conversed at  salisbury   saxon answered   he confided in me  believing me to be one  of the duke of beaufort s household  as to the horse  one party pursued  us on salisbury plain with bloodhounds  and another attacked us not  twenty miles from here and lost a score of troopers and a cornet       we heard something of the brush   said the king   it was bravely done   but if these men are so close we have no great time for preparation       their foot cannot be here before a week   said the mayor   by that time  we might be behind the walls of bristol       there is one point which might be urged   observed wade the lawyer   we  have  as your majesty most truly says  met with heavy discouragement in  the fact that no noblemen and few commoners of repute have declared for  us  the reason is  i opine  that each doth wait for his neighbour to  make a move  should one or two come over the others would soon follow   how  then  are we to bring a duke or two to our standards       there s the question  master wade   said monmouth  shaking his head  despondently      i think that it might be done   continued the whig lawyer   mere  proclamations addressed to the commonalty will not catch these gold  fish  they are not to be angled for with a naked hook  i should  recommend that some form of summons or writ be served upon each of them   calling upon them to appear in our camp within a certain date under pain  of high treason       there spake the legal mind   quoth king monmouth  with a laugh   but  you have omitted to tell us how the said writ or summons is to be  conveyed to these same delinquents       there is the duke of beaufort   continued wade  disregarding the king s  objection   he is president of wales  and he is  as your majesty knows   lieutenant of four english counties  his influence overshadows the whole  west  he hath two hundred horses in his stables at badminton  and a  thousand men  as i have heard  sit down at his tables every day  why  should not a special effort be made to gain over such a one  the more so  as we intend to march in his direction       henry  duke of beaufort  is unfortunately already in arms against his  sovereign   said monmouth gloomily      he is  sire  but he may be induced to turn in your favour the weapon  which he hath raised against you  he is a protestant  he is said to be a  whig  why should we not send a message to him  flatter his pride  appeal  to his religion  coax and threaten him  who knows  he may have private  grievances of which we know nothing  and may be ripe for such a move       your counsel is good  wade   said lord grey   but methinks his majesty  hath asked a pertinent question  your messenger would  i fear  find  himself swinging upon one of the badminton oaks if the duke desired to  show his loyalty to james stuart  where are we to find a man who is wary  enough and bold enough for such a mission  without risking one of our  leaders  who could be ill spared at such a time       it is true   said the king   it were better not to venture it at all  than to do it in a clumsy and halting fashion  beaufort would think that  it was a plot not to gain him over  but to throw discredit upon him  but  what means our giant at the door by signing to us       if it please your majesty   i asked   have i permission to speak       we would fain hear you  captain   he answered graciously   if your  understanding is in any degree correspondent to your strength  your  opinion should be of weight       then  your majesty   said i   i would offer myself as a fitting  messenger in this matter  my father bid me spare neither life nor limb  in this quarrel  and if this honourable council thinks that the duke  may be gained over  i am ready to guarantee that the message shall be  conveyed to him if man and horse can do it       i ll warrant that no better herald could be found   cried saxon   the  lad hath a cool head and a staunch heart       then  young sir  we shall accept your loyal and gallant offer   said  monmouth   are ye all agreed  gentlemen  upon the point   a murmur of  assent rose from the company      you shall draw up the paper  wade  offer him money  a seniority amongst  the dukes  the perpetual presidentship of wales  what you will  if you  can but shake him  if not  sequestration  exile  and everlasting infamy   and  hark ye  you can enclose a copy of the papers drawn up by van  brunow  which prove the marriage of my mother  together with the  attestations of the witnesses  have them ready by to morrow at daybreak   when the messenger may start    note h  appendix       they shall be ready  your majesty   said wade      in that case  gentlemen   continued king monmouth   i may now dismiss  ye to your posts  should anything fresh arise i shall summon ye again   that i may profit by your wisdom  here we shall stay  if sir stephen  timewell will have us  until the men are refreshed and the recruits  enrolled  we shall then make our way bristolwards  and see what luck  awaits us in the north  if beaufort comes over all will be well   farewell  my kind friends  i need not tell ye to be diligent and  faithful      the council rose at the king s salutation  and bowing to him they began  to file out of the castle hall  several of the members clustered round  me with hints for my journey or suggestions as to my conduct      he is a proud  froward man   said one   speak humbly to him or he will  never hearken to your message  but will order you to be scourged out of  his presence       nay  nay   cried another   he is hot  but he loves a man that is a  man  speak boldly and honestly to him  and he is more like to listen to  reason       speak as the lord shall direct you   said a puritan   it is his message  which you bear as well as the king s       entice him out alone upon some excuse   said buyse   then up and away  mit him upon your crupper  hagelsturm  that would be a proper game       leave him alone   cried saxon   the lad hath as much sense as any of  ye  he will see which way the cat jumps  come  friend  let us make our  way back to our men       i am sorry  indeed  to lose you   he said  as we threaded our way  through the throng of peasants and soldiers upon the castle green   your  company will miss you sorely  lockarby must see to the two  if all goes  well you should be back in three or four days  i need not tell you that  there is a real danger  if the duke wishes to prove to james that  he would not allow himself to be tampered with  he can only do it by  punishing the messenger  which as lieutenant of a county he hath power  to do in times of civil commotion  he is a hard man if all reports be  true  on the other hand  if you should chance to succeed it may lay the  foundations of your fortunes and be the means of saving monmouth  he  needs help  by the lord harry  never have i seen such a rabble as this  army of his  buyse says that they fought lustily at this ruffle at  axminster  but he is of one mind with me  that a few whiffs of shot and  cavalry charges would scatter them over the countryside  have you any  message to leave       none  save my love to my mother   said i      it is well  should you fall in any unfair way  i shall not forget his  grace of beaufort  and the next of his gentlemen who comes in my way  shall hang as high as haman  and now you had best make for your chamber   and have as good a slumber as you may  since to morrow at cock crow  begins your new mission          chapter xxii  of the news from havant    having given my orders that covenant should be saddled and bridled by  daybreak  i had gone to my room and was preparing for a long night s  rest  when sir gervas  who slept in the same apartment  came dancing in  with a bundle of papers waving over his head      three guesses  clarke   he cried   what would you most desire       letters from havant   said i eagerly      right   he answered  throwing them into my lap   three of them  and not  a woman s hand among them  sink me  if i can understand what you have  been doing all your life                how can youthful heart resign             lovely woman  sparkling wine      but you are so lost in your news that you have not observed my  transformation       why  wherever did you get these   i asked in astonishment  for he  was attired in a delicate plum coloured suit with gold buttons and  trimmings  set off by silken hosen and spanish leather shoes with roses  on the instep      it smacks more of the court than of the camp   quoth sir gervas   rubbing his hands and glancing down at himself with some satisfaction    i am also revictualled in the matter of ratafia and orange flower  water  together with two new wigs  a bob and a court  a pound of the  imperial snuff from the sign of the black man  a box of de crepigny s  hair powder  my foxskin muff  and several other necessaries  but i  hinder you in your reading       i have seen enough to tell me that all is well at home   i answered   glancing over my father s letter   but how came these things       some horsemen have come in from petersfield  bearing them with them  as  to my little box  which a fair friend of mine in town packed for me   it was to be forwarded to bristol  where i am now supposed to be  and  should be were it not for my good fortune in meeting your party  it  chanced to find its way  however  to the bruton inn  and the good woman  there  whom i had conciliated  found means to send it after me  it is a  good rule to go upon  clarke  in this earthly pilgrimage  always to  kiss the landlady  it may seem a small thing  and yet life is made up  of small things  i have few fixed principles  i fear  but two there are  which i can say from my heart that i never transgress  i always carry a  corkscrew  and i never forget to kiss the landlady       from what i have seen of you   said i  laughing   i could be warranty  that those two duties are ever fulfilled       i have letters  too   said he  sitting on the side of the bed and  turning over a sheaf of papers    your broken hearted araminta   hum   the wench cannot know that i am ruined or her heart would speedily be  restored  what s this  a challenge to match my bird julius against my  lord dorchester s cockerel for a hundred guineas  faith  i am too busy  backing the monmouth rooster for the champion stakes  another asking me  to chase the stag at epping  zounds  had i not cleared off i should  have been run down myself  with a pack of bandog bailiffs at my heels   a dunning letter from my clothier  he can afford to lose this bill   he hath had many a long one out of me  an offer of three thousand from  little dicky chichester  no  no  dicky  it won t do  a gentleman can t  live upon his friends  none the less grateful  how now  from mrs   butterworth  no money for three weeks  bailiffs in the house  now  curse  me  if this is not too bad       what is the matter   i asked  glancing up from my own letters  the  baronet s pale face had taken a tinge of red  and he was striding  furiously up and down the bedroom with a letter crumpled up in his hand      it is a burning shame  clarke   he cried   hang it  she shall have my  watch  it is by tompion  of the sign of the three crowns in paul s  yard  and cost a hundred when new  it should keep her for a few months   mortimer shall measure swords with me for this  i shall write villain  upon him with my rapier s point       i have never seen you ruffled before   said i      no   he answered  laughing   many have lived with me for years and  would give me a certificate for temper  but this is too much  sir edward  mortimer is my mother s younger brother  clarke  but he is not many  years older than myself  a proper  strait laced  soft voiced lad he has  ever been  and  as a consequence  he throve in the world  and joined  land to land after the scriptural fashion  i had befriended him from my  purse in the old days  but he soon came to be a richer man than i  for  all that he gained he kept  whereas all i got  well  it went off like  the smoke of the pipe which you are lighting  when i found that all was  up with me i received from mortimer an advance  which was sufficient to  take me according to my wish over to virginia  together with a horse and  a personal outfit  there was some chance  clarke  of the jerome acres  going to him should aught befall me  so that he was not averse to  helping me off to a land of fevers and scalping knives  nay  never shake  your head  my dear country lad  you little know the wiles of the world       give him credit for the best until the worst is proved   said i   sitting up in bed smoking  with my letters littered about in front of  me      the worst  is  proved   said sir gervas  with a darkening face   i  have  as i said  done mortimer some turns which he might remember   though it did not become me to remind him of them  this mistress  butterworth is mine old wet nurse  and it hath been the custom of the  family to provide for her  i could not bear the thought that in the ruin  of my fortune she should lose the paltry guinea or so a week which stood  between her and hunger  my only request to mortimer  therefore  made on  the score of old friendship  was that he should continue this pittance   i promising that should i prosper i would return whatever he should  disburse  the mean hearted villain wrung my hand and swore that it  should be so  how vile a thing is human nature  clarke  for the sake of  this paltry sum he  a rich man  hath broken his pledge  and left this  poor woman to starve  but he shall answer to me for it  he thinks that  i am on the atlantic  if i march back to london with these brave boys  i shall disturb the tenor of his sainted existence  meanwhile i shall  trust to sun dials  and off goes my watch to mother butterworth  bless  her ample bosoms  i have tried many liquors  but i dare bet that the  first was the most healthy  but how of your own letters  you have been  frowning and smiling like an april day       there is one from my father  with a few words attached from my mother    said i   the second is from an old friend of mine  zachariah palmer  the  village carpenter  the third is from solomon sprent  a retired seaman   for whom i have an affection and respect       you have a rare trio of newsmen  i would i knew your father  clarke  he  must  from what you say  be a stout bit of british oak  i spoke even now  of your knowing little of the world  but indeed it may be that in your  village you can see mankind without the varnish  and so come to learn  more of the good of human nature  varnish or none  the bad will ever  peep through  now this carpenter and seaman show themselves no doubt for  what they are  a man might know my friends of the court for a lifetime   and never come upon their real selves  nor would it perhaps repay the  search when you had come across it  sink me  but i wax philosophical   which is the old refuge of the ruined man  give me a tub  and i shall  set up in the piazza of covent garden  and be the diogenes of london  i  would not be wealthy again  micah  how goes the old lilt                  our money shall never indite us             or drag us to goldsmith hall              no pirates or wrecks can affright us              we that have no estates             fear no plunder or rates              nor care to lock gates              he that lies on the ground cannot fall      that last would make a good motto for an almshouse       you will have sir stephen up   said i warningly  for he was carolling  away at the pitch of his lungs      never fear  he and his  prentices were all at the broad sword exercise  in the hall as i came by  it is worth something to see the old fellow  stamp  and swing his sword  and cry   ha   on the down cut  mistress  ruth and friend lockarby are in the tapestried room  she spinning and he  reading aloud one of those entertaining volumes which she would have me  read  methinks she hath taken his conversion in hand  which may end in  his converting her from a maid into a wife  and so you go to the duke of  beaufort  well  i would that i could travel with you  but saxon will not  hear of it  and my musqueteers must be my first care  god send you safe  back  where is my jasmine powder and the patch box  read me your letters  if there be aught in them of interest  i have been splitting a flask  with our gallant colonel at his inn  and he hath told me enough of your  home at havant to make me wish to know more       this one is somewhat grave   said i      nay  i am in the humour for grave things  have at it  if it contain the  whole platonic philosophy        tis from the venerable carpenter who hath for many years been my  adviser and friend  he is one who is religious without being sectarian   philosophic without being a partisan  and loving without being weak       a paragon  truly   exclaimed sir gervas  who was busy with his eyebrow  brush      this is what he saith   i continued  and proceeded to read the very  letter which i now read to you       having heard from your father  my dear lad  that there was some chance  of being able to send a letter to you  i have written this  and am  now sending it under the charge of the worthy john packingham  of  chichester  who is bound for the west  i trust that you are now safe  with monmouth s army  and that you have received honourable appointment  therein  i doubt not that you will find among your comrades some who  are extreme sectaries  and others who are scoffers and disbelievers   be advised by me  friend  and avoid both the one and the other  for the  zealot is a man who not only defends his own right of worship  wherein  he hath justice  but wishes to impose upon the consciences of others   by which he falls into the very error against which he fights  the mere  brainless scoffer is  on the other hand  lower than the beast of  the field  since he lacks the animal s self respect and humble  resignation        my faith   cried the baronet   the old gentleman hath a rough side to  his tongue        let us take religion upon its broadest base  for the truth must be  broader than aught which we can conceive  the presence of a table doth  prove the existence of a carpenter  and so the presence of a universe  proves the existence of a universe maker  call him by what name  you will  so far the ground is very firm beneath us  without either  inspiration  teaching  or any aid whatever  since  then  there  must  be  a world maker  let us judge of his nature by his work  we cannot observe  the glories of the firmament  its infinite extent  its beauty  and the  divine skill wherewith every plant and animal hath its wants cared for   without seeing that he is full of wisdom  intelligence  and power  we  are still  you will perceive  upon solid ground  without having to call  to our aid aught save pure reason         having got so far  let us inquire to what end the universe was made   and we put upon it  the teaching of all nature shows that it must be to  the end of improvement and upward growth  the increase in real virtue   in knowledge  and in wisdom  nature is a silent preacher which holds  forth upon week days as on sabbaths  we see the acorn grow into the oak   the egg into the bird  the maggot into the butterfly  shall we doubt   then  that the human soul  the most precious of all things  is also  upon the upward path  and how can the soul progress save through the  cultivation of virtue and self mastery  what other way is there  there  is none  we may say with confidence  then  that we are placed here to  increase in knowledge and in virtue         this is the core of all religion  and this much needs no faith in  the acceptance  it is as true and as capable of proof as one of those  exercises of euclid which we have gone over together  on this common  ground men have raised many different buildings  christianity  the creed  of mahomet  the creed of the easterns  have all the same essence  the  difference lies in the forms and the details  let us hold to our own  christian creed  the beautiful  often professed  and seldom practised  doctrine of love  but let us not despise our fellow men  for we are all  branches from the common root of truth         man comes out of darkness into light  he tarries awhile and then  passes into darkness again  micah  lad  the days are passing  mine as  well as thine  let them not be wasted  they are few in number  what says  petrarch   to him that enters  life seems infinite  to him that  departs  nothing   let every day  every hour  be spent in furthering the  creator s end  in getting out whatever power for good there is in you   what is pain  or work  or trouble  the cloud that passes over the sun   but the result of work well done is everything  it is eternal  it lives  and waxes stronger through the centuries  pause not for rest  the rest  will come when the hour of work is past         may god protect and guard you  there is no great news  the portsmouth  garrison hath marched to the west  sir john lawson  the magistrate  hath  been down here threatening your father and others  but he can do little  for want of proofs  church and dissent are at each other s throats as  ever  truly the stern law of moses is more enduring than the sweet words  of christ  adieu  my dear lad  all good wishes from your grey headed  friend  zachariah palmer        od s fish   cried sir gervas  as i folded up the letter   i have heard  stillingfleet and tenison  but i never listened to a better sermon  this  is a bishop disguised as a carpenter  the crozier would suit his hand  better than the plane  but how of our seaman friend  is he a tarpaulin  theologian  a divine among the tarry breeks       solomon sprent is a very different man  though good enough in his way    said i   but you shall judge him from his letter        master clarke  sir   when last we was in company i had run in under  the batteries on cutting out service  while you did stand on and off in  the channel and wait signals  having stopped to refit and to overhaul my  prize  which proved to be in proper trim alow and aloft         what the devil doth he mean   asked sir gervas      it is a maid of whom he talks  phoebe dawson  the sister of the  blacksmith  he hath scarce put foot on land for nigh forty years  and  can as a consequence only speak in this sea jargon  though he fancies  that he uses as pure king s english as any man in hampshire       proceed  then   quoth the baronet       having also read her the articles of war  i explained to her the  conditions under which we were to sail in company on life s voyage   namely         first  she to obey signals without question as soon as received         second  she to steer by my reckoning         third  she to stand by me as true consort in foul weather  battle  or  shipwreck         fourth  she to run under my guns if assailed by picaroons   privateeros  or garda costas         fifth  me to keep her in due repair  dry dock her at intervals   and see that she hath her allowance of coats of paint  streamers  and  bunting  as befits a saucy pleasure boat         sixth  me to take no other craft in tow  and if any be now attached   to cut their hawsers         seventh  me to revictual her day by day         eighth  should she chance to spring a leak  or be blown on her beam  ends by the winds of misfortune  to stand by her and see her pumped out  or righted         ninth  to fly the protestant ensign at the peak during life s voyage   and to lay our course for the great harbour  in the hope that moorings  and ground to swing may be found for two british built crafts when laid  up for eternity          twas close on eight bells before these articles were signed and  sealed  when i headed after you i could not so much as catch a glimpse  of your topsail  soon after i heard as you had gone a soldiering   together with that lean  rakish  long sparred  picaroon like craft which  i have seen of late in the village  i take it unkind of you that you  have not so much as dipped ensign to me on leaving  but perchance  the tide was favourable  and you could not tarry  had i not been  jury rigged  with one of my spars shot away  i should have dearly loved  to have strapped on my hanger and come with you to smell gunpowder once  more  i would do it now  timber toe and all  were it not for my consort   who might claim it as a breach of the articles  and so sheer off  i must  follow the light on her poop until we are fairly joined         farewell  mate  in action  take an old sailor s advice  keep the  weather gauge and board  tell that to your admiral on the day of battle   whisper it in his ear  say to him   keep the weather gauge and board    tell him also to strike quick  strike hard  and keep on striking  that s  the word of christopher mings  and a better man has not been launched   though he did climb in through the hawse pipe   yours to command   solomon sprent       sir gervas had been chuckling to himself during the reading of this  epistle  but at the last part we both broke out a laughing      land or sea  he will have it that battles are fought in ships    said the baronet   you should have had that sage piece of advice for  monmouth s council to day  should he ever ask your opinion it must be    keep the weather gauge and board        i must to sleep   said i  laying aside my pipe   i should be on the  road by daybreak       nay  i prythee  complete your kindness by letting me have a glimpse of  your respected parent  the roundhead        tis but a few lines   i answered   he was ever short of speech  but  if they interest you  you shall hear them   i am sending this by a godly  man  my dear son  to say that i trust that you are bearing yourself as  becomes you  in all danger and difficulty trust not to yourself  but  ask help from on high  if you are in authority  teach your men to sing  psalms when they fall on  as is the good old custom  in action give  point rather than edge  a thrust must beat a cut  your mother and the  others send their affection to you  sir john lawson hath been down  here like a ravening wolf  but could find no proof against me  john  marchbank  of bedhampton  is cast into prison  truly antichrist reigns  in the land  but the kingdom of light is at hand  strike lustily for  truth and conscience   your loving father  joseph clarke         postscriptum  from my mother    i trust that you will remember what i  have said concerning your hosen and also the broad linen collars  which  you will find in the bag  it is little over a week since you left  yet  it seems a year  when cold or wet  take ten drops of daffy s elixir in a  small glass of strong waters  should your feet chafe  rub tallow on the  inside of your boots  commend me to master saxon and to master lockarby   if he be with you  his father was mad at his going  for he hath a great  brewing going forward  and none to mind the mash tub  ruth hath baked a  cake  but the oven hath played her false  and it is lumpy in the inside   a thousand kisses  dear heart  from your loving mother  m  c        a right sensible couple   quoth sir gervas  who  having completed his  toilet  had betaken him to his couch   i now begin to understand your  manufacture  clarke  i see the threads that are used in the weaving of  you  your father looks to your spiritual wants  your mother concerns  herself with the material  yet the old carpenter s preaching is   methinks  more to your taste  you are a rank latitudinarian  man  sir  stephen would cry fie upon you  and joshua pettigrue abjure you  well   out with the light  for we should both be stirring at cock crow  that is  our religion at present       early christians   i suggested  and we both laughed as we settled down  to sleep         chapter xxiii  of the snare on the weston road    just after sunrise i was awoke by one of the mayor s servants  who  brought word that the honourable master wade was awaiting me downstairs   having dressed and descended  i found him seated by the table in the  sitting room with papers and wafer box  sealing up the missive which i  was to carry  he was a small  worn  grey faced man  very erect in his  bearing and sudden in his speech  with more of the soldier than of the  lawyer in his appearance      so   said he  pressing his seal above the fastening of the string   i  see that your horse is ready for you outside  you had best make your way  round by nether stowey and the bristol channel  for we have heard that  the enemy s horse guard the roads on the far side of wells  here is your  packet      i bowed and placed it in the inside of my tunic      it is a written order as suggested in the council  the duke s reply may  be written  or it may be by word of mouth  in either case guard it well   this packet contains also a copy of the depositions of the clergyman at  the hague  and of the other witnesses who saw charles of england marry  lucy walters  the mother of his majesty  your mission is one of such  importance that the whole success of our enterprise may turn upon it   see that you serve the paper upon beaufort in person  and not through  any intermediary  or it might not stand in a court of law      i promised to do so if possible      i should advise you also   he continued   to carry sword and pistol as  a protection against the chance dangers of the road  but to discard your  head piece and steel front as giving you too warlike an aspect for a  peaceful messenger       i had already come to that resolve   said i      there is nothing more to be said  captain   said the lawyer  giving me  his hand   may all good fortune go with you  keep a still tongue and a  quick ear  watch keenly how all things go  mark whose face is gloomy and  whose content  the duke may be at bristol  but you had best make for his  seat at badminton  our sign of the day is tewkesbury      thanking my instructor for his advice i went out and mounted covenant   who pawed and champed at his bit in his delight at getting started  once more  few of the townsmen were stirring  though here and there  a night bonneted head stared out at me through a casement  i took the  precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance  from the house  for i had told reuben nothing of my intended journey   and i was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline  nor even  his new ties of love  would prevent him from coming with me  covenant s  iron shod feet rang sharply  in spite of my care  upon the cobblestones   but looking back i saw that the blinds of my faithful friend s room  were undrawn  and that all seemed quiet in the house  i shook my bridle   therefore  and rode at a brisk trot through the silent streets  which  were still strewn with faded flowers and gay with streamers  at the  north gate a guard of half a company was stationed  who let me pass upon  hearing the word  once beyond the old walls i found myself out on the  country side  with my face to the north and a clear road in front of me     it was a blithesome morning  the sun was rising over the distant hills   and heaven and earth were ruddy and golden  the trees in the wayside  orchards were full of swarms of birds  who chattered and sang until the  air was full of their piping  there was lightsomeness and gladness in  every breath  the wistful eyed red somerset kine stood along by the  hedgerows  casting great shadows down the fields and gazing at me as  i passed  farm horses leaned over wooden gates  and snorted a word of  greeting to their glossy coated brother  a great herd of snowy fleeced  sheep streamed towards us over the hillside and frisked and gambolled in  the sunshine  all was innocent life  from the lark which sang on high  to the little shrew mouse which ran amongst the ripening corn  or the  martin which dashed away at the sound of my approach  all alive and all  innocent  what are we to think  my dear children  when we see the beasts  of the field full of kindness and virtue and gratitude  where is this  superiority of which we talk     from the high ground to the north i looked back upon the sleeping town   with the broad edging of tents and waggons  which showed how suddenly  its population had outgrown it  the royal standard still fluttered  from the tower of st  mary magdalene  while close by its beautiful  brother turret of st  james bore aloft the blue flag of monmouth  as  i gazed the quick petulant roll of a drum rose up on the still morning  air  with the clear ringing call of the bugles summoning the troops from  their slumbers  beyond the town  and on either side of it  stretched a  glorious view of the somersetshire downs  rolling away to the distant  sea  with town and hamlet  castle turret and church tower  wooded coombe  and stretch of grain land  as fair a scene as the eye could wish to rest  upon  as i wheeled my horse and sped upon my way i felt  my dears  that  this was a land worth fighting for  and that a man s life was a small  thing if he could but aid  in however trifling a degree  in working out  its freedom and its happiness  at a little village over the hill i fell  in with an outpost of horse  the commander of which rode some distance  with me  and set me on my road to nether stowey  it seemed strange to  my hampshire eyes to note that the earth is all red in these parts  very  different to the chalk and gravel of havant  the cows  too  are mostly  red  the cottages are built neither of brick nor of wood  but of some  form of plaster  which they call cob  which is strong and smooth so  long as no water comes near it  they shelter the walls from the rain   therefore  by great overhanging thatches  there is scarcely a steeple in  the whole country side  which also seems strange to a man from any other  part of england  every church hath a square tower  with pinnacles upon  the top  and they are mostly very large  with fine peals of bells     my course ran along by the foot of the beautiful quantock hills  where  heavy wooded coombes are scattered over the broad heathery downs  deep  with bracken and whortle bushes  on either side of the track steep  winding glens sloped downwards  lined with yellow gorse  which blazed  out from the deep red soil like a flame from embers  peat coloured  streams splashed down these valleys and over the road  through which  covenant ploughed fetlock deep  and shied to see the broad backed trout  darting from between his fore feet     all day i rode through this beautiful country  meeting few folk  for  i kept away from the main roads  a few shepherds and farmers  a  long legged clergyman  a packman with his mule  and a horseman with a  great bag  whom i took to be a buyer of hair  are all that i can recall   a black jack of ale and the heel of a loaf at a wayside inn were all my  refreshments  near combwich  covenant cast a shoe  and two hours were  wasted before i found a smithy in the town and had the matter set right   it was not until evening that i at last came out upon the banks of the  bristol channel  at a place called shurton bars  where the muddy parret  makes its way into the sea  at this point the channel is so broad that  the welsh mountains can scarcely be distinguished  the shore is flat  and black and oozy  flecked over with white patches of sea birds  but  further to the east there rises a line of hills  very wild and rugged   rising in places into steep precipices  these cliffs run out into the  sea  and numerous little harbours and bays are formed in their broken  surface  which are dry half the day  but can float a good sized boat at  half tide  the road wound over these bleak and rocky hills  which are  sparsely inhabited by a wild race of fishermen  or shepherds  who came  to their cabin doors on hearing the clatter of my horse s hoofs  and  shot some rough west country jest at me as i passed  as the night drew  in the country became bleaker and more deserted  an occasional light  twinkling in the distance from some lonely hillside cottage was the only  sign of the presence of man  the rough track still skirted the sea  and  high as it was  the spray from the breakers drifted across it  the salt  prinkled on my lips  and the air was filled with the hoarse roar of the  surge and the thin piping of curlews  who flitted past in the darkness  like white  shadowy  sad voiced creatures from some other world  the  wind blew in short  quick  angry puffs from the westward  and far out on  the black waters a single glimmer of light rising and falling  tossing  up  and then sinking out of sight  showed how fierce a sea had risen in  the channel     riding through the gloaming in this strange wild scenery my mind  naturally turned towards the past  i thought of my father and my mother   of the old carpenter and of solomon sprent  then i pondered over decimus  saxon  his many faced character having in it so much to be admired and  so much to be abhorred  did i like him or no  it was more than i could  say  from him i wandered off to my faithful reuben  and to his love  passage with the pretty puritan  which in turn brought me to sir gervas  and the wreck of his fortunes  my mind then wandered to the state of the  army and the prospects of the rising  which led me to my present mission  with its perils and its difficulties  having turned over all these  things in my mind i began to doze upon my horse s back  overcome by the  fatigue of the journey and the drowsy lullaby of the waves  i had just  fallen into a dream in which i saw reuben lockarby crowned king of  england by mistress ruth timewell  while decimus saxon endeavoured to  shoot him with a bottle of daffy s elixir  when in an instant   without warning  i was dashed violently from my horse  and left lying  half conscious on the stony track     so stunned and shaken was i by the sudden fall  that though i had a dim  knowledge of shadowy figures bending over me  and of hoarse laughter  sounding in my ears  i could not tell for a few minutes where i was nor  what had befallen me  when at last i did make an attempt to recover my  feet i found that a loop of rope had been slipped round my arms and my  legs so as to secure them  with a hard struggle i got one hand free  and  dashed it in the face of one of the men who were holding me down  but  the whole gang of a dozen or more set upon me at once  and while some  thumped and kicked at me  others tied a fresh cord round my elbows  and  deftly fastened it in such a way as to pinion me completely  finding  that in my weak and dazed state all efforts were of no avail  i lay  sullen and watchful  taking no heed of the random blows which were still  showered upon me  so dark was it that i could neither see the faces of  my attackers  nor form any guess as to who they might be  or how they  had hurled me from my saddle  the champing and stamping of a horse hard  by showed me that covenant was a prisoner as well as his master      dutch pete s got as much as he can carry   said a rough  harsh voice    he lies on the track as limp as a conger       ah  poor pete   muttered another   he ll never deal a card or drain a  glass of the right cognac again       there you lie  mine goot vriend   said the injured man  in weak   quavering tones   and i will prove that you lie if you have a flaschen  in your pocket       if pete were dead and buried   the first speaker said   a word about  strong waters would bring him to  give him a sup from your bottle   dicon      there was a great gurgling and sucking in the darkness  followed by a  gasp from the drinker   gott sei gelobt   he exclaimed in a stronger  voice   i have seen more stars than ever were made  had my kopf not  been well hooped he would have knocked it in like an ill staved cask  he  shlags like the kick of a horse      as he spoke the edge of the moon peeped over a cliff and threw a flood  of cold clear light upon the scene  looking up i saw that a strong rope  had been tied across the road from one tree trunk to another about eight  feet above the ground  this could not be seen by me  even had i been  fully awake  in the dusk  but catching me across the breast as covenant  trotted under it  it had swept me off and dashed me with great force to  the ground  either the fall or the blows which i had received had cut me  badly  for i could feel the blood trickling in a warm stream past my  ear and down my neck  i made no attempt to move  however  but waited in  silence to find out who these men were into whose hands i had fallen   my one fear was lest my letters should be taken away from me  and my  mission rendered of no avail  that in this  my first trust  i should be  disarmed without a blow and lose the papers which had been confided to  me  was a chance which made me flush and tingle with shame at the very  thought     the gang who had seized me were rough bearded fellows in fur caps and  fustian jackets  with buff belts round their waists  from which hung  short straight whinyards  their dark sun dried faces and their great  boots marked them as fishermen or seamen  as might be guessed from their  rude sailor speech  a pair knelt on either side with their hands upon  my arms  a third stood behind with a cocked pistol pointed at my head   while the others  seven or eight in number  were helping to his feet the  man whom i had struck  who was bleeding freely from a cut over the eye      take the horse up to daddy mycroft s   said a stout  black bearded man   who seemed to be their leader   it is no mere dragooner hack  note  i  appendix  but a comely  full blooded brute  which will fetch sixty  pieces at the least  your share of that  peter  will buy salve and  plaster for your cut       ha  houndsfoot   cried the dutchman  shaking his fist at me   you  would strike peter  would you  you would draw peter s blood  would you   tausend teufel  man  if you and i were together upon the hillside we  should see vich vas the petter man       slack your jaw tackle  pete   growled one of his comrades   this fellow  is a limb of satan for sure  and doth follow a calling that none but a  mean  snivelling  baseborn son of a gun would take to  yet i warrant   from the look of him  that he could truss you like a woodcock if he had  his great hands upon you  and you would howl for help as you did last  martinmas  when you did mistake cooper dick s wife for a gauger       truss me  would he  todt und holle   cried the other  whom the blow  and the brandy had driven to madness   we shall see  take that  thou  deyvil s spawn  take that   he ran at me  and kicked me as hard as he  could with his heavy sea boots     some of the gang laughed  but the man who had spoken before gave  the dutchman a shove that sent him whirling   none of that   he said  sternly   we ll have british fair play on british soil  and none of your  cursed longshore tricks  i won t stand by and see an englishman  kicked  d ye see  by a tub bellied  round starned  schnapps swilling   chicken hearted son of an amsterdam lust vrouw  hang him  if the skipper  likes  that s all above board  but by thunder  if it s a fight that you  will have  touch that man again       all right  dicon   said their leader soothingly   we all know that  pete s not a fighting man  but he s the best cooper on the coast  eh   pete  there is not his equal at staving  hooping  and bumping  he ll  take a plank of wood and turn it into a keg while another man would be  thinking of it       oh  you remember that  captain murgatroyd   said the dutchman sulkily    but you see me knocked about and shlagged  and bullied  and called  names  and what help have i  so help me  when the  maria  is in the  texel next  i ll take to my old trade  i will  and never set foot on her  again       no fear   the captain answered  laughing   while the  maria  brings in  five thousand good pieces a year  and can show her heels to any cutter  on the coast  there is no fear of greedy pete losing his share of her   why  man  at this rate you may have a lust haus of your own in a year or  two  with a trimmed lawn  and the trees all clipped like peacocks  and  the flowers in pattern  and a canal by the door  and a great bouncing  house wife just like any burgomeister  there s many such a fortune been  made out of mechlin and cognac       aye  and there s many a broken kopf got over mechlin and cognac    grumbled my enemy   donner  there are other things beside lust houses  and flower beds  there are lee shores and nor  westers  beaks and  preventives       and there s where the smart seaman has the pull over the herring buss   or the skulking coaster that works from christmas to christmas with all  the danger and none of the little pickings  but enough said  up with the  prisoner  and let us get him safely into the bilboes      i was raised to my feet and half carried  half dragged along in the  midst of the gang  my horse had already been led away in the opposite  direction  our course lay off the road  down a very rocky and rugged  ravine which sloped away towards the sea  there seemed to be no trace of  a path  and i could only stumble along over rocks and bushes as best i  might in my fettered and crippled state  the blood  however  had  dried over my wounds  and the cool sea breeze playing upon my forehead  refreshed me  and helped me to take a clearer view of my position     it was plain from their talk that these men were smugglers  as such   they were not likely to have any great love for the government  or  desire to uphold king james in any way  on the contrary  their goodwill  would probably be with monmouth  for had i not seen the day before a  whole regiment of foot in his army  raised from among the coaster folk   on the other hand  their greed might be stronger than their loyalty  and  might lead them to hand me over to justice in the hope of reward  on the  whole it would be best  i thought  to say nothing of my mission  and to  keep my papers secret as long as possible     but i could not but wonder  as i was dragged along  what had led these  men to lie in wait for me as they had done  the road along which i had  travelled was a lonely one  and yet a fair number of travellers bound  from the west through weston to bristol must use it  the gang could  not lie in perpetual guard over it  why had they set a trap on this  particular night  then  the smugglers were a lawless and desperate body   but they did not  as a rule  descend to foot paddery or robbery  as long  as no one interfered with them they were seldom the first to break the  peace  then  why had they lain in wait for me  who had never injured  them  could it possibly be that i had been betrayed  i was still turning  over these questions in my mind when we all came to a halt  and the  captain blew a shrill note on a whistle which hung round his neck     the place where we found ourselves was the darkest and most rugged spot  in the whole wild gorge  on either side great cliffs shot up  which  arched over our heads  with a fringe of ferns and bracken on either lip   so that the dark sky and the few twinkling stars were well nigh hid   great black rocks loomed vaguely out in the shadowy light  while in  front a high tangle of what seemed to be brushwood barred our road  at a  second whistle  however  a glint of light was seen through the branches   and the whole mass was swung to one side as though it moved upon a  hinge  beyond it a dark winding passage opened into the side of the  hill  down which we went with our backs bowed  for the rock ceiling was  of no great height  on every side of us sounded the throbbing of the  sea     passing through the entrance  which must have been dug with great labour  through the solid rock  we came out into a lofty and roomy cave  lit  up by a fire at one end  and by several torches  by their smoky yellow  glare i could see that the roof was  at least  fifty feet above us  and  was hung by long lime crystals  which sparkled and gleamed with great  brightness  the floor of the cave was formed of fine sand  as soft and  velvety as a wilton carpet  sloping down in a way which showed that the  cave must at its mouth open upon the sea  which was confirmed by the  booming and splashing of the waves  and by the fresh salt air which  filled the whole cavern  no water could be seen  however  as a sharp  turn cut off our view of the outlet     in this rock girt space  which may have been sixty paces long and  thirty across  there were gathered great piles of casks  kegs and cases   muskets  cutlasses  staves  cudgels  and straw were littered about upon  the floor  at one end a high wood fire blazed merrily  casting strange  shadows along the walls  and sparkling like a thousand diamonds among  the crystals on the roof  the smoke was carried away through a great  cleft in the rocks  seated on boxes  or stretched on the sand round the  fire  there were seven or eight more of the band  who sprang to their  feet and ran eagerly towards us as we entered     have ye got him   they cried   did he indeed come  had he attendants       he is here  and he is alone   the captain answered   our hawser fetched  him off his horse as neatly as ever a gull was netted by a cragsman   what have ye done in our absence  silas       we have the packs ready for carriage   said the man addressed  a  sturdy  weather beaten seaman of middle age   the silk and lace are done  in these squares covered over with sacking  the one i have marked  yarn   and the other  jute   a thousand of mechlin to a hundred of the shiny   they will sling over a mule s back  brandy  schnapps  schiedam  and  hamburg goldwasser are all set out in due order  the  baccy is in the  flat cases over by the black drop there  a plaguey job we had carrying  it all out  but here it is ship shape at last  and the lugger floats  like a skimming dish  with scarce ballast enough to stand up to a  five knot breeze       any signs of the  fairy queen    asked the smuggler      none  long john is down at the water s edge looking out for her  flash light  this wind should bring her up if she has rounded  combe martin point  there was a sail about ten miles to the  east nor  east at sundown  she might have been a bristol schooner  or  she might have been a king s fly boat       a king s crawl boat   said captain murgatroyd  with a sneer   we cannot  hang the gauger until venables brings up the  fairy queen   for after  all it was one of his hands that was snackled  let him do his own dirty  work       tausend blitzen   cried the ruffian dutchman   would it not be a kindly  grass to captain venables to chuck the gauger down the black drop ere he  come  he may have such another job to do for us some day       zounds  man  are you in command or am i   said the leader angrily    bring the prisoner forward to the fire  now  hark ye  dog of a  land shark  you are as surely a dead man as though you were laid out  with the tapers burning  see here   he lifted a torch  and showed by  its red light a great crack in the floor across the far end of the  cave   you can judge of the black drop s depth   he said  raising an  empty keg and tossing it over into the yawning gulf  for ten seconds  we stood silent before a dull distant clatter told that it had at last  reached the bottom      it will carry him half way to hell before the breath leaves him   said  one      it s an easier death than the devizes gallows   cried a second      nay  he shall have the gallows first   a third shouted   it is but his  burial that we are arranging       he hath not opened his mouth since we took him   said the man who was  called dicon   is he a mute  then  find your tongue  my fine fellow  and  let us hear what your name is  it would have been well for you if you  had been born dumb  so that you could not have sworn our comrade s life  away       i have been waiting for a civil question after all this brawling and  brabbling   said i   my name is micah clarke  now  pray inform me who ye  may be  and by what warrant ye stop peaceful travellers upon the public  highway       this is our warrant   murgatroyd answered  touching the hilt of his  cutlass   as to who we are  ye know that well enough  your name is  not clarke  but westhouse  or waterhouse  and you are the same cursed  exciseman who snackled our poor comrade  cooper dick  and swore away his  life at ilchester       i swear that you are mistaken   i replied   i have never in my life  been in these parts before       fine words  fine words   cried another smuggler   gauger or no  you  must jump for it  since you know the secret of our cave       your secret is safe with me   i answered   but if ye wish to murder me   i shall meet my fate as a soldier should  i should have chosen to die on  the field of battle  rather than to lie at the mercy of such a pack of  water rats in their burrow       my faith   said murgatroyd   this is too tall talk for a gauger  he  bears himself like a soldier  too  it is possible that in snaring the  owl we have caught the falcon  yet we had certain token that he would  come this way  and on such another horse       call up long john   suggested the dutchman   i vould not give a plug of  trinidado for the schelm s word  long john was with cooper dick when he  was taken       aye   growled the mate silas   he got a wipe over the arm from the  gauger s whinyard  he ll know his face  if any will       call him  then   said murgatroyd  and presently a long  loose limbed  seaman came up from the mouth of the cave  where he had been on watch   he wore a red kerchief round his forehead  and a blue jerkin  the sleeve  of which he slowly rolled up as he came nigh      where is gauger westhouse   he cried   he has left his mark on my arm   rat me  if the scar is healed yet  the sun is on our side of the wall  now  gauger  but hullo  mates  who be this that ye have clapped into  irons  this is not our man       not our man   they cried  with a volley of curses      why  this fellow would make two of the gauger  and leave enough over  to fashion a magistrate s clerk  ye may hang him to make sure  but still  he s not the man       yes  hang him   said dutch pete   sapperment  is our cave to be the  talk of all the country  vere is the pretty  maria  to go then  vid her  silks and her satins  her kegs and her cases   are we to risk our  cave for the sake of this fellow  besides  has he not schlagged my  kopf  schlagged your cooper s kopf  as if he had hit me mit mine own  mallet  is that not vorth a hemp cravat       worth a jorum of rumbo   cried dicon   by your leave  captain  i would  say that we are not a gang of padders and michers  but a crew of honest  seamen  who harm none but those who harm us  exciseman westhouse hath  slain cooper dick  and it is just that he should die for it  but as to  taking this young soldier s life  i d as soon think of scuttling the  saucy  maria   or of mounting the jolly roger at her peak      what answer would have been given to this speech i cannot tell  for  at that moment a shrill whistle resounded outside the cave  and two  smugglers appeared bearing between them the body of a man  it hung so  limp that i thought at first that he might be dead  but when they threw  him on the sand he moved  and at last sat up like one who is but half  awoken from a swoon  he was a square dogged faced fellow  with a long  white scar down his cheek  and a close fitting blue coat with brass  buttons      it s gauger westhouse   cried a chorus of voices   yes  it is gauger  westhouse   said the man calmly  giving his neck a wriggle as though he  were in pain   i represent the king s law  and in its name i arrest ye  all  and declare all the contraband goods which i see around me to be  confiscate and forfeited  according to the second section of the first  clause of the statute upon illegal dealing  if there are any honest men  in this company  they will assist me in the execution of my duty   he  staggered to his feet as he spoke  but his spirit was greater than his  strength  and he sank back upon the sand amid a roar of laughter from  the rough seamen      we found him lying on the road when we came from daddy mycroft s   said  one of the new comers  who were the same men who had led away my horse    he must have passed just after you left  and the rope caught him under  the chin and threw him a dozen paces  we saw the revenue button on his  coat  so we brought him down  body o  me  but he kicked and plunged for  all that he was three quarters stunned       have ye slacked the hawser   the captain asked      we cast one end loose and let it hang        tis well  we must keep him for captain venables  but now  as to our  other prisoner  we must overhaul him and examine his papers  for so many  craft are sailing under false colours that we must needs be careful   hark ye  mister soldier  what brings you to these parts  and what king  do you serve  for i hear there s a mutiny broke out  and two skippers  claim equal rating in the old british ship       i am serving under king monmouth   i answered  seeing that the proposed  search must end in the finding of my papers      under king monmouth   cried the smuggler   nay  friend  that rings  somewhat false  the good king hath  i hear  too much need of his friends  in the south to let an able soldier go wandering along the sea coast  like a cornish wrecker in a sou  wester       i bear despatches   said i   from the king s own hand to henry duke  of beaufort  at his castle at badminton  ye can find them in my inner  pocket  but i pray ye not to break the seal  lest it bring discredit  upon my mission       sir   cried the gauger  raising himself upon his elbow   i do hereby  arrest you on the charge of being a traitor  a promoter of treason  a  vagrant  and a masterless man within the meaning of the fourth statute  of the act  as an officer of the law i call upon you to submit to my  warrant       brace up his jaw with your scarf  jim   said murgatroyd   when venables  comes he will soon find a way to check his gab  yes   he continued   looking at the back of my papers   it is marked  as you say   from james  the second of england  known lately as the duke of monmouth  to henry  duke of beaufort  president of wales  by the hand of captain micah  clarke  of saxon s regiment of wiltshire foot   cast off the lashings   dicon  so  captain  you are a free man once more  and i grieve that we  should have unwittingly harmed you  we are good lutherans to a man  and  would rather speed you than hinder you on this mission       could we not indeed help him on his way   said the mate silas   for  myself  i don t fear a wet jacket or a tarry hand for the cause  and  i doubt not ye are all of my way of thinking  now with this breeze we  could run up to bristol and drop the captain by morning  which would  save him from being snapped up by any land sharks on the road       aye  aye   cried long john   the king s horse are out beyond weston   but he could give them the slip if he had the  maria  under him       well   said murgatroyd   we could get back by three long tacks   venables will need a day or so to get his goods ashore  if we are to  sail back in company we shall have time on our hands  how would the plan  suit you  captain       my horse   i objected      it need not stop us  i can rig up a handy horse stall with my spare  spars and the grating  the wind has died down  the lugger could be  brought to dead man s edge  and the horse led down to it  run up to  daddy s  jim  and you  silas  see to the boat  here is some cold junk  and biscuit  seaman s fare  captain  and a glass o  the real jamaica to  wash it down an  thy stomach be not too dainty for rough living      i seated myself on a barrel by the fire  and stretched my limbs  which  were cramped and stiffened by their confinement  while one of the seamen  bathed the cut on my head with a wet kerchief  and another laid out some  food on a case in front of me  the rest of the gang had trooped away to  the mouth of the cave to prepare the lugger  save only two or three who  stood on guard round the ill fated gauger  he lay with his back resting  against the wall of the cave  and his arms crossed over his breast   glancing round from time to time at the smugglers with menacing eyes  as  a staunch old hound might gaze at a pack of wolves who had overmatched  him  i was turning it over in my own mind whether aught could be done to  help him  when murgatroyd came over  and dipping a tin pannikin into the  open rum tub  drained it to the success of my mission      i shall send silas bolitho with you   said he   while i bide here to  meet venables  who commands my consort  if there is aught that i can do  to repay you for your ill usage        there is but one thing  captain   i broke in eagerly   it is as much   or more  for your own sake than mine that i ask it  do not allow this  unhappy man to be murdered      murgatroyd s face flushed with anger   you are a plain speaker  captain  clarke   said he   this is no murder  it is justice  what harm do we  here  there is not an old housewife over the whole countryside who does  not bless us  where is she to buy her souchong  or her strong waters   except from us  we charge little  and force our goods on no one  we are  peaceful traders  yet this man and his fellows are ever yelping at our  heels  like so many dogfish on a cod bank  we have been harried  and  chivied  and shot at until we are driven into such dens as this  a month  ago  four of our men were bearing a keg up the hillside to farmer black   who hath dealt with us these five years back  of a sudden  down came  half a score of horse  led by this gauger  hacked and slashed with their  broad swords  cut long john s arm open  and took cooper dick prisoner   dick was haled to ilchester gaol  and hung up after the assizes like  a stoat on a gamekeeper s door  this night we had news that this very  gauger was coming this way  little knowing that we should be on the  look out for him  is it a wonder that we should lay a trap for him  and  that  having caught him  we should give him the same justice as he gave  our comrades       he is but a servant  i argued   he hath not made the law  it is his  duty to enforce it  it is with the law itself that your quarrel is       you are right   said the smuggler gloomily   it is with judge moorcroft  that we have our chief account to square  he may pass this road upon his  circuit  heaven send he does  but we shall hang the gauger too  he knows  our cave now  and it would be madness to let him go      i saw that it was useless to argue longer  so i contented myself with  dropping my pocket knife on the sand within reach of the prisoner  in  the hope that it might prove to be of some service to him  his guards  were laughing and joking together  and giving little heed to their  charge  but the gauger was keen enough  for i saw his hand close over  it     i had walked and smoked for an hour or more  when silas the mate  appeared  and said that the lugger was ready and the horse aboard   bidding murgatroyd farewell  i ventured a few more words in favour of  the gauger  which were received with a frown and an angry shake of the  head  a boat was drawn up on the sand  inside the cave  at the water s  edge  into this i stepped  as directed  with my sword and pistols  which  had been given back to me  while the crew pushed her off and sprang in  as she glided into deep water     i could see by the dim light of the single torch which murgatroyd held  upon the margin  that the roof of the cave sloped sheer down upon us as  we sculled slowly out towards the entrance  so low did it come at last  that there was only a space of a few feet between it and the water  and  we had to bend our heads to avoid the rocks above us  the boatmen gave  two strong strokes  and we shot out from under the overhanging ledge   and found ourselves in the open with the stars shining murkily above  us  and the moon showing herself dimly and cloudily through a gathering  haze  right in front of us was a dark blur  which  as we pulled towards  it  took the outline of a large lugger rising and falling with the pulse  of the sea  her tall thin spars and delicate network of cordage towered  above us as we glided under the counter  while the creaking of blocks  and rattle of ropes showed that she was all ready to glide off upon her  journey  lightly and daintily she rode upon the waters  like some giant  seafowl  spreading one white pinion after another in preparation for  her flight  the boatmen ran us alongside and steadied the dinghy while i  climbed over the bulwarks on to the deck     she was a roomy vessel  very broad in the beam  with a graceful curve in  her bows  and masts which were taller than any that i had seen on such  a boat on the solent  she was decked over in front  but very deep in the  after part  with ropes fixed all round the sides to secure kegs when the  hold should be full  in the midst of this after deck the mariners had  built a strong stall  in which my good steed was standing  with a bucket  full of oats in front of him  my old friend shoved his nose against my  face as i came aboard  and neighed his pleasure at finding his master  once more  we were still exchanging caresses when the grizzled head of  silas bolitho the mate popped out of the cabin hatchway      we are fairly on our way now  captain clarke   said he   the breeze  has fallen away to nothing  as you can see  and we may be some time in  running down to our port  are you not aweary       i am a little tired   i confessed   my head is throbbing from the crack  i got when that hawser of yours dashed me from my saddle       an hour or two of sleep will make you as fresh as a mother carey s  chicken   said the smuggler   your horse is well cared for  and you can  leave him without fear  i will set a man to tend him  though  truth to  say  the rogues know more about studding sails and halliards than they  do of steeds and their requirements  yet no harm can come to him  so you  had best come down and turn in      i descended the steep stairs which led down into the low roofed cabin of  the lugger  on either side a recess in the wall had been fitted up as a  couch      this is your bed   said he  pointing to one of them   we shall call  you if there be aught to report   i needed no second invitation  but  flinging myself down without undressing  i sank in a few minutes into  a dreamless sleep  which neither the gentle motion of the boat nor the  clank of feet above my head could break off         chapter xxiv  of the welcome that met me at badminton    when i opened my eyes i had some ado to recall where i was  but on  sitting up it was brought home to me by my head striking the low ceiling  with a sharp rap  on the other side of the cabin silas bolitho was  stretched at full length with a red woollen nightcap upon his head  fast  asleep and snoring  in the centre of the cabin hung a swing table   much worn  and stained all over with the marks of countless glasses  and pannikins  a wooden bench  screwed to the floor  completed the  furniture  with the exception of a stand of muskets along one side   above and below the berths in which we lay were rows of lockers  in  which  doubtless  some of the more choice laces and silks were stowed   the vessel was rising and falling with a gentle motion  but from the  flapping of canvas i judged that there was little wind  slipping quietly  from my couch  so as not to wake the mate  i stole upon deck     we were  i found  not only becalmed  but hemmed in by a dense fog bank  which rolled in thick  choking wreaths all round us  and hid the very  water beneath us  we might have been a ship of the air riding upon  a white cloud bank  now and anon a little puff of breeze caught the  foresail and bellied it out for a moment  only to let it flap back  against the mast  limp and slack  once more  a sunbeam would at times  break through the dense cloud  and would spangle the dead grey wall with  a streak of rainbow colour  but the haze would gather in again and shut  off the bright invader  covenant was staring right and left with great  questioning eyes  the crew were gathered along the bulwarks and smoking  their pipes while they peered out into the dense fog      god den  captain   said dicon  touching his fur cap   we have had a  rare run while the breeze lasted  and the mate reckoned before he turned  in that we were not many miles from bristol town       in that case  my good fellow   i answered   ye can set me ashore  for i  have not far to go       we must e en wait till the fog lifts   said long john   there s only  one place along here  d ye see  where we can land cargoes unquestioned   when it clears we shall turn her head for it  but until we can take our  bearings it is anxious work wi  the sands under our lee       keep a look out there  tom baldock   cried dicon to a man in the bows    we are in the track of every bristol ship  and though there s so little  wind  a high sparred craft might catch a breeze which we miss       sh   said long john suddenly  holding up his hand in warning   sh      we listened with all our ears  but there was no sound  save the gentle  wash of the unseen waves against our sides      call the mate   whispered the seaman   there s a craft close by us  i  heard the rattle of a rope upon her deck      silas bolitho was up in an instant  and we all stood straining our ears   and peering through the dense fog bank  we had well nigh made up our  minds that it was a false alarm  and the mate was turning back in no  very good humour  when a clear loud bell sounded seven times quite  close to us  followed by a shrill whistle and a confused shouting and  stamping      it s a king s ship   growled the mate   that s seven bells  and the  bo sun is turning out the watch below       it was on our quarter   whispered one      nay  i think it was on our larboard bow   said another     the mate held up his hand  and we all listened for some fresh sign  of the whereabouts of our scurvy neighbour  the wind had freshened a  little  and we were slipping through the water at four or five knots  an hour  of a sudden a hoarse voice was heard roaring at our very side     bout ship   it shouted   bear a hand on the lee braces  there  stand  by the halliards  bear a hand  ye lazy rogues  or i ll be among ye with  my cane  with a wannion to ye       it is a king s ship  sure enough  and she lies just there   said long  john  pointing out over the quarter   merchant adventurers have  civil tongues  it s your blue coated  gold braided  swivel eyed   quarter deckers that talk of canes  ha  did i not tell ye      as he spoke  the white screen of vapour rolled up like the curtain in  a playhouse  and uncovered a stately war ship  lying so close that we  could have thrown a biscuit aboard  her long  lean  black hull rose  and fell with a slow  graceful rhythm  while her beautiful spars and  snow white sails shot aloft until they were lost in the wreaths of fog  which still hung around her  nine bright brass cannons peeped out at us  from her portholes  above the line of hammocks  which hung like carded  wool along her bulwarks  we could see the heads of the seamen staring  down at us  and pointing us out to each other  on the high poop stood an  elderly officer with cocked hat and trim white wig  who at once whipped  up his glass and gazed at us through it      ahoy  there   he shouted  leaning over the taffrail   what lugger is  that       the  lucy    answered the mate   bound from porlock quay to bristol  with hides and tallow  stand ready to tack   he added in a lower voice    the fog is coming down again       ye have one of the hides with the horse still in it   cried the  officer   run down under our counter  we must have a closer look at ye       aye  aye  sir   said the mate  and putting his helm hard down the boom  swung across  and the  maria  darted off like a scared seabird into the  fog  looking back there was nothing but a dim loom to show where we had  left the great vessel  we could hear  however  the hoarse shouting of  orders and the bustle of men      look out for squalls  lads   cried the mate   he ll let us have it  now      he had scarcely spoken before there were half a dozen throbs of flame in  the mist behind  and as many balls sung among our rigging  one cut away  the end of the yard  and left it dangling  another grazed the bowsprit   and sent a puff of white splinters into the air      warm work  captain  eh   said old silas  rubbing his hands   zounds   they shoot better in the dark than ever they did in the light  there  have been more shots fired at this lugger than she could carry wore she  loaded with them  and yet they never so much as knocked the paint off  her before  there they go again      a fresh discharge burst from the man of war  but this time they had lost  all trace of us  and were firing by guess      that is their last bark  sir   said dicon      no fear  they ll blaze away for the rest of the day   growled another  of the smugglers   why  lor  bless ye  it s good exercise for the crew   and the  munition is the king s  so it don t cost nobody a groat       it s well the breeze freshened   said long john   i heard the creak o   davits just after the first discharge  she was lowering her boats  or  i m a dutchman       the petter for you if you vas  you seven foot stock fish   cried my  enemy the cooper  whose aspect was not improved by a great strip of  plaster over his eye   you might have learned something petter than to  pull on a rope  or to swab decks like a vrouw all your life       i ll set you adrift in one of your own barrels  you skin of lard   said  the seaman   how often are we to trounce you before we knock the sauce  out of you       the fog lifts a little towards the land   silas remarked   methinks i  see the loom of st  austin s point  it rises there upon the starboard  bow       there it is  sure enough  sir   cried one of the seamen  pointing to a  dark cape which cut into the mist      steer for the three fathom creek then   said the mate   when we are on  the other side of the point  captain clarke  we shall be able to land  your horse and yourself  you will then be within a few hours  ride of  your destination      i led the old seaman aside  and having thanked him for the kindness  which he had shown me  i spoke to him of the gauger  and implored him to  use his influence to save the man      it rests with captain venables   said he gloomily   if we let him go  what becomes of our cave       is there no way of insuring his silence   i asked   well  we might ship  him to the plantations   said the mate   we could take him to the texel  with us  and get captain donders or some other to give him a lift across  the western ocean       do so   said i   and i shall take care that king monmouth shall hear of  the help which ye have given his messenger       well  we shall be there in a brace of shakes   he remarked   let us go  below and load your ground tier  for there is nothing like starting well  trimmed with plenty of ballast in the hold      following the sailor s advice i went down with him and enjoyed a rude  but plentiful meal  by the time that we had finished  the lugger had  been run into a narrow creek  with shelving sandy banks on either side   the district was wild and marshy  with few signs of any inhabitants   with much coaxing and pushing covenant was induced to take to the water   and swam easily ashore  while i followed in the smuggler s dinghy  a  few words of rough  kindly leave taking were shouted after me  i saw the  dinghy return  and the beautiful craft glided out to sea and faded away  once more into the mists which still hung over the face of the waters     truly providence works in strange ways  my children  and until a  man comes to the autumn of his days he can scarce say what hath been  ill luck and what hath been good  for of all the seeming misfortunes  which have befallen me during my wandering life  there is not one which  i have not come to look upon as a blessing  and if you once take this  into your hearts  it is a mighty help in enabling you to meet all  troubles with a stiff lip  for why should a man grieve when he hath not  yet determined whether what hath chanced may not prove to be a cause of  rejoicing  now here ye will perceive that i began by being dashed upon  a stony road  beaten  kicked  and finally well nigh put to death in  mistake for another  yet it ended in my being safely carried to my  journey s end  whereas  had i gone by land  it is more than likely that  i should have been cut off at weston  for  as i heard afterwards  a  troop of horse were making themselves very active in those parts by  blocking the roads and seizing all who came that way     being now alone  my first care was to bathe my face and hands in a  stream which ran down to the sea  and to wipe away any trace of my  adventures of the night before  my cut was but a small one  and was  concealed by my hair  having reduced myself to some sort of order i next  rubbed down my horse as best i could  and rearranged his girth and his  saddle  i then led him by the bridle to the top of a sandhill hard by   whence i might gain some idea as to my position     the fog lay thick upon the channel  but all inland was very clear and  bright  along the coast the country was dreary and marshy  but at the  other side a goodly extent of fertile plain lay before me  well tilled  and cared for  a range of lofty hills  which i guessed to be the  mendips  bordered the whole skyline  and further north there lay a  second chain in the blue distance  the glittering avon wound its way  over the country side like a silver snake in a flower bed  close to its  mouth  and not more than two leagues from where i stood  rose the spires  and towers of stately bristol  the queen of the west  which was and  still may be the second city in the kingdom  the forests of masts which  shot up like a pinegrove above the roofs of the houses bore witness to  the great trade both with ireland and with the plantations which had  built up so flourishing a city     as i knew that the duke s seat was miles on the gloucestershire side of  the city  and as i feared lest i might be arrested and examined should i  attempt to pass the gates  i struck inland with intent to ride round the  walls and so avoid the peril  the path which i followed led me into a  country lane  which in turn opened into a broad highway crowded with  travellers  both on horseback and on foot  as the troublous times  required that a man should journey with his arms  there was naught in  my outfit to excite remark  and i was able to jog on among the other  horsemen without question or suspicion  from their appearance they were   i judged  country farmers or squires for the most part  who were riding  into bristol to hear the news  and to store away their things of price  in a place of safety      by your leave  zur   said a burly  heavy faced man in a velveteen  jacket  riding up upon my bridle arm   can you tell me whether his grace  of beaufort is in bristol or at his house o  badminton      i answered that i could not tell  but that i was myself bound for his  presence      he was in bristol yestreen a drilling o  the train bands   said the  stranger   but  indeed  his grace be that loyal  and works that hard for  his majesty s cause  that he s a  ower the county  and it is but chance  work for to try and to catch him  but if you are about to zeek him   whither shall you go       i will to badminton   i answered   and await him there  can you tell me  the way       what  not know the way to badminton   he cried  with a blank stare of  wonder   whoy  i thought all the warld knew that  you re not fra wales  or the border counties  zur  that be very clear       i am a hampshire man   said i   i have come some distance to see the  duke       aye  so i should think   he cried  laughing loudly   if you doan t know  the way to badminton you doan t know much  but i ll go with you  danged  if i doan t  and i ll show you your road  and run my chance o  finding  the duke there  what be your name       micah clarke is my name       and vairmer brown is mine  john brown by the register  but better  knowed as the vairmer  tak  this turn to the right off the high road   now we can trot our beasts and not be smothered in other folk s dust   and what be you going to beaufort for       on private matters which will not brook discussion   i answered      lor   now  affairs o  state belike   said he  with a whistle   well  a  still tongue saves many a neck  i m a cautious man myself  and these be  times when i wouldna whisper some o  my thoughts  no  not into the ears  o  my old brown mare here  for fear i d see her some day standing over  against me in the witness box       they seem very busy over there   i remarked  for we were now in full  sight of the walls of bristol  where gangs of men were working hard with  pick and shovel improving the defences      aye  they be busy sure enough  makin  ready in case the rebels come  this road  cromwell and his tawnies found it a rasper in my vather s  time  and monmouth is like to do the same       it hath a strong garrison  too   said i  bethinking me of saxon s  advice at salisbury   i see two or three regiments out yonder on the  bare open space       they have four thousand foot and a thousand horse   the farmer  answered   but the foot are only train bands  and there s no trusting  them after axminster  they say up here that the rebels run to nigh  twenty thousand  and that they give no quarter  well  if we must have  civil war  i hope it may be hot and sudden  not spun out for a dozen  years like the last one  if our throats are to be cut  let it be with a  shairp knife  and not with a blunt hedge shears       what say you to a stoup of cider   i asked  for we were passing an  ivy clad inn  with  the beaufort arms  printed upon the sign      with all my heart  lad   my companion answered   ho  there  two pints  of the old hard brewed  that will serve to wash the dust down  the real  beaufort arms is up yonder at badminton  for at the buttery hatch one  may call for what one will in reason and never put hand to pocket       you speak of the house as though you knew it well   said i      and who should know it better   asked the sturdy farmer  wiping his  lips  as we resumed our journey   why  it seems but yesterday that i  played hide and seek wi  my brothers in the old boteler castle  that  stood where the new house o  badminton  or acton turville  as some calls  it  now stands  the duke hath built it but a few years  and  indeed  his  dukedom itself is scarce older  there are some who think that he would  have done better to stick by the old name that his forebears bore       what manner of man is the duke   i asked      hot and hasty  like all of his blood  yet when he hath time to think   and hath cooled down  he is just in the main  your horse hath been in  the water this morning  vriend       yes   said i shortly   he hath had a bath       i am going to his grace on the business of a horse   quoth my  companion   his officers have pressed my piebald four year old  and  taken it without a  with your leave   or  by your leave   for the use of  the king  i would have them know that there is something higher than  the duke  or even than the king  there is the english law  which will  preserve a man s goods and his chattels  i would do aught in reason for  king james s service  but my piebald four year old is too much       i fear that the needs of the public service will override your  objection   said i      why it is enough to make a man a whig   he cried   even the roundheads  always paid their vair penny for every pennyworth they had  though they  wanted a vair pennyworth for each penny  i have heard my father say that  trade was never so brisk as in  forty six  when they were down this way   old noll had a noose of hemp ready for horse stealers  were they for  king or for parliament  but here comes his grace s carriage  if i  mistake not      as he spoke a great heavy yellow coach  drawn by six cream coloured  flemish mares  dashed down the road  and came swiftly towards us  two  mounted lackeys galloped in front  and two others all in light blue and  silver liveries rode on either side      his grace is not within  else there had been an escort behind   said  the farmer  as we reined our horses aside to let the carriage pass  as  they swept by he shouted out a question as to whether the duke was at  badminton  and received a nod from the stately bewigged coachman in  reply      we are in luck to catch him   said farmer brown   he s as hard to find  these days as a crake in a wheatfield  we should be there in an hour  or less  i must thank you that i did not take a fruitless journey into  bristol  what did you say your errand was      i was again compelled to assure him that the matter was not one of which  i could speak with a stranger  on which he appeared to be huffed  and  rode for some miles without opening his mouth  groves of trees lined the  road on either side  and the sweet smell of pines was in our nostrils   far away the musical pealing of a bell rose and fell on the hot  close  summer air  the shelter of the branches was pleasant  for the sun was  very strong  blazing down out of a cloudless heaven  and raising a haze  from the fields and valleys       tis the bell from chipping sodbury   said my companion at last  wiping  his ruddy face   that s sodbury church yonder over the brow of the hill   and here on the right is the entrance of badminton park      high iron gates  with the leopard and griffin  which are the supporters  of the beaufort arms  fixed on the pillars which flanked them  opened  into a beautiful domain of lawn and grass land with clumps of trees  scattered over it  and broad sheets of water  thick with wild fowl  at  every turn as we rode up the winding avenue some new beauty caught our  eyes  all of which were pointed out and expounded by farmer brown  who  seemed to take as much pride in the place as though it belonged to him   here it was a rockery where a thousand bright coloured stones shone out  through the ferns and creepers which had been trained over them  there  it was a pretty prattling brook  the channel of which had been turned so  as to make it come foaming down over a steep ledge of rocks  or perhaps  it was some statue of nymph or sylvan god  or some artfully built  arbour overgrown with roses or honeysuckle  i have never seen grounds  so tastefully laid out  and it was done  as all good work in art must  be done  by following nature so closely that it only differed from her  handiwork in its profusion in so narrow a compass  a few years later our  healthy english taste was spoiled by the pedant gardening of the dutch  with their straight flat ponds  and their trees all clipped and in a  line like vegetable grenadiers  in truth  i think that the prince of  orange and sir william temple had much to answer for in working this  change  but things have now come round again  i understand  and we have  ceased to be wiser than nature in our pleasure grounds     as we drew near the house we came on a large extent of level sward on  which a troop of horse were exercising  who were raised  as my companion  informed me  entirely from the duke s own personal attendants  passing  them we rode through a grove of rare trees and came out on a broad space  of gravel which lay in front of the house  the building itself was of  great extent  built after the new italian fashion  rather for comfort  than for defence  but on one wing there remained  as my companion  pointed out  a portion of the old keep and battlements of the feudal  castle of the botelers  looking as out of place as a farthingale of  queen elizabeth joined to a court dress fresh from paris  the main  doorway was led up to by lines of columns and a broad flight of marble  steps  on which stood a group of footmen and grooms  who took our horses  when we dismounted  a grey haired steward or major domo inquired our  business  and on learning that we wished to see the duke in person  he  told us that his grace would give audience to strangers in the afternoon  at half after three by the clock  in the meantime he said that the  guests  dinner had just been laid in the hall  and it was his master s  wish that none who came to badminton should depart hungry  my companion  and i were but too glad to accept the steward s invitation  so having  visited the bath room and attended to the needs of the toilet  we  followed a footman  who ushered us into a great room where the company  had already assembled     the guests may have numbered fifty or sixty  old and young  gentle and  simple  of the most varied types and appearance  i observed that many  of them cast haughty and inquiring glances round them  in the pauses  between the dishes  as though each marvelled how he came to be a member  of so motley a crew  their only common feature appeared to be the  devotion which they showed to the platter and the wine flagon  there was  little talking  for there were few who knew their neighbours  some were  soldiers who had come to offer their swords and their services to  the king s lieutenant  others were merchants from bristol  with some  proposal or suggestion anent the safety of their property  there  were two or three officials of the city  who had come out to receive  instructions as to its defence  while here and there i marked the child  of israel  who had found his way there in the hope that in times of  trouble he might find high interest and noble borrowers  horse dealers   saddlers  armourers  surgeons  and clergymen completed the company   who were waited upon by a staff of powdered and liveried servants  who  brought and removed the dishes with the silence and deftness of long  training     the room was a contrast to the bare plainness of sir stephen timewell s  dining hall at taunton  for it was richly panelled and highly decorated  all round  the floor was formed of black and white marble  set in  squares  and the walls were of polished oak  and bore a long line of  paintings of the somerset family  from john of gaunt downwards  the  ceiling  too  was tastefully painted with flowers and nymphs  so that a  man s neck was stiff ere he had done admiring it  at the further end of  the hall yawned a great fireplace of white marble  with the lions and  lilies of the somerset arms carved in oak above it  and a long gilt  scroll bearing the family motto   mutare vel timere sperno   the massive  tables at which we sat were loaded with silver chargers and candelabra   and bright with the rich plate for which badminton was famous  i could  not but think that  if saxon could clap eyes upon it  he would not be  long in urging that the war be carried on in this direction     after dinner we were all shown into a small ante chamber  set round with  velvet settees  where we were to wait till the duke was ready to see us   in the centre of this room there stood several cases  glass topped and  lined with silk  wherein were little steel and iron rods  with brass  tubes and divers other things  very bright and ingenious  though i  could not devise for what end they had been put together  a  gentleman in waiting came round with paper and ink horn  making notes  of our names and of our business  him i asked whether it might not be  possible for me to have an entirely private audience      his grace never sees in private   he replied   he has ever his chosen  councillors and officers in attendance       but the business is one which is only fit for his own ear   i urged      his grace holds that there is no business fit only for his own ear    said the gentleman   you must arrange matters as best you can when  you are shown in to him  i will promise  however  that your request be  carried to him  though i warn you that it cannot be granted      i thanked him for his good offices  and turned away with the farmer to  look at the strange little engines within the cases      what is it   i asked   i have never seen aught that was like it       it is the work of the mad marquis of worcester   quoth he   he was the  duke s grandfather  he was ever making and devising such toys  but they  were never of any service to himself or to others  now  look ye here   this wi  the wheels were called the water engine  and it was his crazy  thought that  by heating the water in that ere kettle  ye might make the  wheels go round  and thereby travel along iron bars quicker nor a  horse could run   oons  i d match my old brown mare against all such  contrivances to the end o  time  but to our places  for the duke is  coming      we had scarce taken our seats with the other suitors  when the  folding doors were flung open  and a stout  thick  short man of fifty   or thereabouts  came bustling into the room  and strode down it between  two lines of bowing clients  he had large projecting blue eyes  with  great pouches of skin beneath them  and a yellow  sallow visage  at his  heels walked a dozen officers and men of rank  with flowing wigs and  clanking swords  they had hardly passed through the opposite door into  the duke s own room  when the gentleman with the list called out a name   and the guests began one after the other to file into the great man s  presence      methinks his grace is in no very gentle temper   quoth farmer brown    did you not mark how he gnawed his nether lip as he passed       he seemed a quiet gentleman enough   i answered   it would try job  himself to see all these folk of an afternoon       hark at that   he whispered  raising his finger  as he spoke the  sound of the duke s voice in a storm of wrath was heard from the inner  chamber  and a little sharp faced man came out and flew through the  ante chamber as though fright had turned his head      he is an armourer of bristol   whispered one of my neighbours   it is  likely that the duke cannot come to terms with him over a contract       nay   said another   he supplied sir marmaduke hyson s troop with  sabres  and it is said that the blades will bend as though they were  lead  once used they can never be fitted back into the scabbard again       the tall man who goes in now is an inventor   quoth the first   he hath  the secret of some very grievous fire  such as hath been used by the  greeks against the turks in the levant  which he desires to sell for the  better fortifying of bristol      the greek fire seemed to be in no great request with the duke  for the  inventor came out presently with his face as red as though it had been  touched by his own compound  the next upon the list was my honest friend  the farmer  the angry tones which greeted him promised badly for the  fate of the four year old  but a lull ensued  and the farmer came out  and resumed his seat  rubbing his great red hands with satisfaction      ecod   he whispered   he was plaguy hot at first  but he soon came  round  and he hath promised that if i pay for the hire of a dragooner as  long as the war shall last i shall have back the piebald      i had been sitting all this time wondering how in the world i was  to conduct my business amid the swarm of suppliants and the crowd of  officers who were attending the duke  had there been any likelihood  of my gaining audience with him in any other way i should gladly have  adopted it  but all my endeavours to that end had been useless  unless i  took this occasion i might never come face to face with him at all   but how could he give due thought or discussion to such a matter  before others  what chance was there of his weighing it as it should be  weighed  even if his feelings inclined him that way  he dared not show  any sign of wavering when so many eyes were upon him  i was tempted to  feign some other reason for my coming  and trust to fortune to give me  some more favourable chance for handing him my papers  but then that  chance might never arrive  and time was pressing  it was said that he  would return to bristol next morning  on the whole  it seemed best that  i should make the fittest use i could of my present position in the hope  that the duke s own discretion and self command might  when he saw the  address upon my despatches  lead to a more private interview     i had just come to this resolution when my name was read out  on which i  rose and advanced into the inner chamber  it was a small but lofty room   hung in blue silk with a broad gold cornice  in the centre was a square  table littered over with piles of papers  and behind this sat his grace  with full bottomed wig rolling down to his shoulders  very stately and  imposing  he had the same subtle air of the court which i had observed  both in monmouth and in sir gervas  which  with his high bold features  and large piercing eyes  marked him as a leader of men  his private  scrivener sat beside him  taking notes of his directions  while the  others stood behind in a half circle  or took snuff together in the deep  recess of the window      make a note of smithson s order   he said  as i entered   a hundred  pots and as many fronts and backs to be ready by tuesday  also six score  snaphances for the musqueteers  and two hundred extra spades for the  workers  mark that the order be declared null and void unless fulfilled  within the time appointed       it is so marked  your grace       captain micah clarke   said the duke  reading from the list in front of  him   what is your wish  captain       one which it would be better if i could deliver privately to your  grace   i answered      ah  you are he who desired private audience  well  captain  these are  my council and they are as myself  so we may look upon ourselves as  alone  what i may hear they may hear  zounds  man  never stammer and  boggle  but out with it      my request had roused the interest of the company  and those who were in  the window came over to the table  nothing could have been worse for the  success of my mission  and yet there was no help for it but to deliver  my despatches  i can say with a clear conscience  without any vainglory   that i had no fears for myself  the doing of my duty was the one thought  in my mind  and here i may say once for all  my dear children  that i am  speaking of myself all through this statement with the same freedom  as though it were another man  in very truth the strong active lad of  one and twenty  was  another man from the grey headed old fellow who  sits in the chimney corner and can do naught better than tell old tales  to the youngsters  shallow water gives a great splash  and so a braggart  has ever been contemptible in my eyes  i trust  therefore  that ye will  never think that your grandad is singing his own praises  or setting  himself up as better than his neighbours  i do but lay the facts  as far  as i can recall them  before ye with all freedom and with all truth     my short delay and hesitation had sent a hot flush of anger into the  duke s face  so i drew the packet of papers from my inner pocket and  handed them to him with a respectful bow  as his eyes fell upon the  superscription  he gave a sudden start of surprise and agitation  making  a motion as though to hide them in his bosom  if this were his impulse  he overcame it  and sat lost in thought for a minute or more with the  papers in his hand  then with a quick toss of the head  like a man who  hath formed his resolution  he broke the seals and cast his eyes over  the contents  which he then threw down upon the table with a bitter  laugh      what think ye  gentlemen   he cried  looking round with scornful eyes    what think ye this private message hath proved to be  it is a letter  from the traitor monmouth  calling upon me to resign the allegiance of  my natural sovereign and to draw my sword in his behalf  if i do this  i am to have his gracious favour and protection  if not  i incur  sequestration  banishment  and ruin  he thinks beaufort s loyalty is  to be bought like a packman s ware  or bullied out of him by ruffling  words  the descendant of john of gaunt is to render fealty to the brat  of a wandering playwoman      several of the company sprang to their feet  and a general buzz of  surprise and anger greeted the duke s words  he sat with bent brows   beating his foot against the ground  and turning over the papers upon  the table      what hath raised his hopes to such mad heights   he cried   how doth  he presume to send such a missive to one of my quality  is it because he  hath seen the backs of a parcel of rascally militiamen  and because  he hath drawn a few hundred chawbacons from the plough s tail to his  standard  that he ventures to hold such language to the president of  wales  but ye will be my witnesses as to the spirit in which i received  it       we can preserve your grace from all danger of slander on that point    said an elderly officer  while a murmur of assent from the others  greeted the remark      and you   cried beaufort  raising his voice and turning his flashing  eyes upon me   who are you that dare to bring such a message to  badminton  you had surely taken leave of your senses ere you did set out  upon such an errand       i am in the hands of god here as elsewhere   i answered  with some  flash of my father s fatalism   i have done what i promised to do  and  the rest is no concern of mine       you shall find it a very close concern of thine   he shouted  springing  from his chair and pacing up and down the room   so close as to put an  end to all thy other concerns in this life  call in the halberdiers from  the outer hall  now  fellow  what have you to say for yourself       there is naught to be said   i answered      but something to be done   he retorted in a fury   seize this man and  secure his hands      four halberdiers who had answered the summons closed in upon me and laid  hands on me  resistance would have been folly  for i had no wish to harm  the men in the doing of their duty  i had come to take my chance  and  if that chance should prove to be death  as seemed likely enough at  present  it must be met as a thing foreseen  i thought of those old time  lines which master chillingfoot  of petersfield  had ever held up to our  admiration                non civium ardor prava jubentium            non vultus instantis tyranni            mente quatit solida     here was the  vultus instantis tyranni   in this stout  be wigged   lace covered  yellow faced man in front of me  i had obeyed the poet in  so far that my courage had not been shaken  i confess that this spinning  dust heap of a world has never had such attractions for me that it would  be a pang to leave it  never  at least  until my marriage  and that  you  will find  alters your thoughts about the value of your life  and many  other of your thoughts as well  this being so  i stood erect  with my  eyes fixed upon the angry nobleman  while his soldiers were putting the  gyves about my wrists         chapter xxv  of strange doings in the boteler dungeon     take down this fellow s statement   said the duke to his scrivener    now  sirrah  it may not be known to you that his gracious majesty the  king hath conferred plenary powers upon me during these troubled times   and that i have his warrant to deal with all traitors without either  jury or judge  you do bear a commission  i understand  in the rebellious  body which is here described as saxon s regiment of wiltshire foot   speak the truth for your neck s sake       i will speak the truth for the sake of something higher than that  your  grace   i answered   i command a company in that regiment       and who is this saxon       i will answer all that i may concerning myself   said i   but not a  word which may reflect upon others       ha   he roared  hot with anger   our pretty gentleman must needs stand  upon the niceties of honour after taking up arms against his king  i  tell you  sir  that your honour is in such a parlous state already that  you may well throw it over and look to your safety  the sun is sinking  in the west  ere it set your life  too  may have set for ever       i am the keeper of my own honour  your grace   i answered   as to my  life  i should not be standing here this moment if i had any great dread  of losing it  it is right that i should tell you that my colonel hath  sworn to exact a return for any evil that may befall me  on you or any  of your household who may come into his power  this i say  not as a  threat  but as a warning  for i know him to be a man who is like to be  as good as his word       your colonel  as you call him  may find it hard enough to save himself  soon   the duke answered with a sneer   how many men hath monmouth with  him      i smiled and shook my head      how shall we make this traitor find his tongue   he asked furiously   turning to his council      i should clap on the thumbikins   said one fierce faced old soldier      i have known a lighted match between the fingers work wonders   another  suggested   sir thomas dalzell hath in the scottish war been able to  win over several of that most stubborn and hardened race  the western  covenanters  by such persuasion       sir thomas dalzell   said a grey haired gentleman  clad in black  velvet   hath studied the art of war among the muscovites  in their  barbarous and bloody encounters with the turks  god forbid that we  christians of england should seek our examples among the skin clad  idolaters of a savage country       sir william would like to see war carried out on truly courteous  principles   said the first speaker   a battle should be like a stately  minuet  with no loss of dignity or of etiquette       sir   the other answered hotly   i have been in battles when you were  in your baby linen  and i handled a battoon when you could scarce shake  a rattle  in leaguer or onfall a soldier s work is sharp and stern  but  i say that the use of torture  which the law of england hath abolished   should also be laid aside by the law of nations       enough  gentlemen  enough   cried the duke  seeing that the dispute was  like to wax warm   your opinion  sir william  hath much weight with us   and yours also  colonel hearn  we shall discuss this at greater length  in privacy  halberdiers  remove the prisoner  and let a clergyman be  sent to look to his spiritual needs       shall we take him to the strong room  your grace   asked the captain of  the guard      no  to the old boteler dungeon   he replied  and i heard the next name  upon the list called out  while i was led through a side door with a  guard in front and behind me  we passed through endless passages and  corridors  with heavy stop and clank of arms  until we reached the  ancient wing  here  in the corner turret  was a small  bare room  mouldy  and damp  with a high  arched roof  and a single long slit in the outer  wall to admit light  a small wooden couch and a rude chair formed  the whole of the furniture  into this i was shown by the captain  who  stationed a guard at the door  and then came in after me and loosened  my wrists  he was a sad faced man  with solemn sunken eyes and a  dreary expression  which matched ill with his bright trappings and gay  sword knot      keep your heart up  friend   said he  in a hollow voice   it is but a  choke and a struggle  a day or two since we had the same job to do  and  the man scarcely groaned  old spender  the duke s marshal  hath as sure  a trick of tying and as good judgment in arranging a drop as hath dun  of tyburn  be of good heart  therefore  for you shall not fall into the  hands of a bungler       i would that i could let monmouth know that his letters were  delivered   i exclaimed  seating myself on the side of the bed      i  faith  they were delivered  had you been the penny postman of mr   robert murray  of whom we heard so much in london last spring  you could  not have handed it in more directly  why did you not talk the duke fair   he is a gracious nobleman  and kind of heart  save when he is thwarted  or angered  some little talk as to the rebels  numbers and dispositions  might have saved you       i wonder that you  as a soldier  should speak or think of such a  thing   said i coldly      well  well  your neck is your own  if it please you to take a leap into  nothing it were pity to thwart you  but his grace commanded that you  should have the chaplain  i must away to him       i prythee do not bring him   said i   i am one of a dissenting stock   and i see that there is a bible in yonder recess  no man can aid me in  making my peace with god       it is well   he answered   for dean hewby hath come over from  chippenham  and he is discoursing with our good chaplain on the need of  self denial  moistening his throat the while with a flask of the prime  tokay  at dinner i heard him put up thanks for what he was to receive   and in the same breath ask the butler how he dared to serve a deacon  of the church with a pullet without truffle dressing  but  perhaps  you  would desire dean hewby s spiritual help  no  well  what i can do for  you in reason shall be done  since you will not be long upon our hands   above all  keep a cheery heart      he left the cell  but presently unlocked the door and pushed his dismal  face round the corner   i am captain sinclair  of the duke s household    he said   should you have occasion to ask for me  you had best have  spiritual help  for i do assure you that there hath been something worse  than either warder or prisoner in this cell       what then   i asked      why  marry  nothing less than the devil   he answered  coming in and  closing the door   it was in this way   he went on  sinking his voice    two years agone hector marot  the highwayman  was shut up in this very  boteler dungeon  i was myself on guard in the corridor that night  and  saw the prisoner at ten o clock sitting on that bed even as you are now   at twelve i had occasion to look in  as my custom is  with the hope  of cheering his lonely hours  when lo  he was gone  yes  you may well  stare  mine eyes had never been off the door  and you can judge what  chance there was of his getting through the windows  walls and floor are  both solid stone  which might be solid rock for the thickness  when  i entered there was a plaguy smell of brimstone  and the flame of my  lanthorn burned blue  nay  it is no smiling matter  if the devil did not  run away with hector marot  pray who did  for sure i am that no angel of  grace could come to him as to peter of old  perchance the evil one may  desire a second bird out of the same cage  and so i tell you this that  you may be on your guard against his assaults       nay  i fear him not   i answered      it is well   croaked the captain   be not cast down   his head  vanished  and the key turned in the creaking lock  so thick were the  walls that i could hear no sound after the door was closed  save for  the sighing of the wind in the branches of the trees outside the narrow  window  all was as silent as the grave within the dungeon     thus left to myself i tried to follow captain sinclair s advice as to  the keeping up of my heart  though his talk was far from being of a  cheering nature  in my young days  more particularly among the sectaries  with whom i had been brought most in contact  a belief in the occasional  appearance of the prince of darkness  and his interference in bodily  form with the affairs of men  was widespread and unquestioning   philosophers in their own quiet chambers may argue learnedly on the  absurdity of such things  but in a dim lit dungeon  cut off from the  world  with the grey gloaming creeping down  and one s own fate hanging  in the balance  it becomes a very different matter  the escape  if the  captain s story were true  appeared to border upon the miraculous  i  examined the walls of the cell very carefully  they were formed of great  square stones cunningly fitted together  the thin slit or window was  cut through the centre of a single large block  all over  as high as  the hand could reach  the face of the walls was covered with letters and  legends cut by many generations of captives  the floor was composed of  old foot worn slabs  firmly cemented together  the closest search failed  to show any hole or cranny where a rat could have escaped  far less a  man     it is a very strange thing  my dears  to sit down in cold blood  and  think that the chances are that within a few hours your pulses will  have given their last throb  and your soul have sped away upon its final  errand  strange and very awesome  the man who rideth down into the  press of the battle with his jaw set and his grip tight upon reign and  sword hilt cannot feel this  for the human mind is such that one emotion  will ever push out another  neither can the man who draws slow and  catching breaths upon the bed of deadly sickness be said to have  experience of it  for the mind weakened with disease can but submit  without examining too closely that which it submits to  when  however   a young and hale man sits alone in quiet  and sees present death hanging  over him  he hath such food for thought that  should he survive and live  to be grey headed  his whole life will be marked and altered by those  solemn hours  as a stream is changed in its course by some rough bank  against which it hath struck  every little fault and blemish stands  out clear in the presence of death  as the dust specks appear when the  sunbeam shines into the darkened room  i noted them then  and i have  i  trust  noted them ever since     i was seated with my head bowed upon my breast  deeply buried in this  solemn train of thoughts  when i was startled by hearing a sharp click   such as a man might give who wished to attract attention  i sprang to my  feet and gazed round in the gathering gloom without being able to tell  whence it came  i had well nigh persuaded myself that my senses had  deceived me  when the sound was repeated louder than before  and casting  my eyes upwards i saw a face peering in at me through the slit  or part  of a face rather  for i could but see the eye and corner of the cheek   standing on my chair i made out that it was none other than the farmer  who had been my companion upon the road      hush  lad   he whispered  with a warning forefinger pushed through the  narrow crack   speak low  or the guard may chance to hear  what can i do  for you       how did you come to know where i was   i asked in astonishment      whoy  mun   he answered   i know as much of this  ere house as beaufort  does himsel   afore badminton was built  me and my brothers has spent  many a day in climbing over the old boteler tower  it s not the first  time that i have spoke through this window  but  quick  what can i do  for you       i am much beholden to you  sir   i answered   but i fear that there is  no help which you can give me  unless  indeed  you could convey news to  my friends in the army of what hath befallen me       i might do that   whispered farmer brown   hark ye in your ear  lad   what i never breathed to man yet  mine own conscience pricks me at times  over this bolstering up of a papist to rule over a protestant nation   let like rule like  say i  at the  lections i rode to sudbury  and i  put in my vote for maister evans  of turnford  who was in favour o  the  exclusionists  sure enough  if that same bill had been carried  the duke  would be sitting on his father s throne  the law would have said yes   now  it says nay  a wonderful thing is the law with its yea  yea  and  nay  nay  like barclay  the quaker man  that came down here in a leather  suit  and ca d the parson a steepleman  there s the law  it s no use  shootin  at it  or passin  pikes through it  no  nor chargin  at it wi   a troop of horse  if it begins by saying  nay  it will say  nay  to the  end of the chapter  ye might as well fight wi  the book o  genesis  let  monmouth get the law changed  and it will do more for him than all the  dukes in england  for all that he s a protestant  and i would do what i  might to serve him       there is a captain lockarby  who is serving in colonel saxon s  regiment  in monmouth s army   said i   should things go wrong with me   i would take it as a great kindness if you would bear him my love  and  ask him to break it gently  by word or by letter  to those at havant   if i were sure that this would be done  it would be a great ease to my  mind       it shall be done  lad   said the good farmer   i shall send my best man  and fleetest horse this very night  that they may know the straits in  which you are  i have a file here if it would help you       nay   i answered   human aid can do little to help me here       there used to be a hole in the roof  look up and see if you can see  aught of it       it arches high above my head   i answered  looking upwards   but there  is no sign of any opening       there was one   he repeated   my brother roger hath swung himself down  wi  a rope  in the old time the prisoners were put in so  like joseph  into the pit  the door is but a new thing       hole or no hole  it cannot help me   i answered   i have no means  of climbing to it  do not wait longer  kind friend  or you may find  yourself in trouble       good bye then  my brave heart   he whispered  and the honest grey eye  and corner of ruddy cheek disappeared from the casement  many a time  during the course of the long evening i glanced up with some wild hope  that he might return  and every creak of the branches outside brought me  on to the chair  but it was the last that i saw of farmer brown     this kindly visit  short as it was  relieved my mind greatly  for i had  a trusty man s word that  come what might  my friends should  at least   have some news of my fate  it was now quite dark  and i was pacing up  and down the little chamber  when the key turned in the door  and the  captain entered with a rushlight and a great bowl of bread and milk      here is your supper  friend   said he   take it down  appetite or no   for it will give you strength to play the man at the time ye wot of   they say it was beautiful to see my lord russell die upon tower hill  be  of good cheer  folk may say as much of you  his grace is in a terrible  way  he walketh up and down  and biteth his lip  and clencheth his hands  like one who can scarce contain his wrath  it may not be against you   but i know not what else can have angered him      i made no answer to this job s comforter  so he presently left me   placing the bowl upon the chair  with the rushlight beside it  i  finished the food  and feeling the better for it  stretched myself upon  the couch  and fell into a heavy and dreamless sleep  this may have  lasted three or four hours  when i was suddenly awoken by a sound like  the creaking of hinges  sitting up on the pallet i gazed around me  the  rushlight had burned out and the cell was impenetrably dark  a greyish  glimmer at one end showed dimly the position of the aperture  but all  else was thick and black  i strained my ears  but no further sound fell  upon them  yet i was certain that i had not been deceived  and that the  noise which had aroused me was within my very chamber  i rose and felt  my way slowly round the room  passing my hand over the walls and door   then i paced backwards and forwards to test the flooring  neither around  me nor beneath me was there any change  whence did the sound come from   then  i sat down upon the side of the bed and waited patiently in the  hope of hearing it once again     presently it was repeated  a low groaning and creaking as though a door  or shutter long disused was being slowly and stealthily opened  at the  same time a dull yellow light streamed down from above  issuing from a  thin slit in the centre of the arched roof above me  slowly as i watched  it this slit widened and extended as if a sliding panel were being  pulled out  until a good sized hole was left  through which i saw a  head  looking down at me  outlined against the misty light behind it   the knotted end of a rope was passed through this aperture  and came  dangling down to the dungeon floor  it was a good stout piece of hemp   strong enough to bear the weight of a heavy man  and i found  upon  pulling at it  that it was firmly secured above  clearly it was the  desire of my unknown benefactor that i should ascend by it  so i went  up hand over hand  and after some difficulty in squeezing my shoulders  through the hole i succeeded in reaching the room above  while i was  still rubbing my eyes after the sudden change from darkness into light   the rope was swiftly whisked up and the sliding shutter closed once  more  to those who were not in the secret there was nothing to throw  light upon my disappearance     i found myself in the presence of a stout short man clad in a rude  jerkin and leather breeches  which gave him somewhat the appearance of a  groom  he wore a broad felt hat drawn down very low over his eyes  while  the lower part of his face was swathed round with a broad cravat  in his  hand he bore a horn lanthorn  by the light of which i saw that the  room in which we were was of the same size as the dungeon beneath  and  differed from it only in having a broad casement which looked out upon  the park  there was no furniture in the chamber  but a great beam ran  across it  to which the rope had been fastened by which i ascended      speak low  friend   said the stranger   the walls are thick and the  doors are close  yet i would not have your guardians know by what means  you have been spirited away       truly  sir   i answered   i can scarce credit that it is other than a  dream  it is wondrous that my dungeon should be so easily broken into   and more wondrous still that i should find a friend who would be willing  to risk so much for my sake       look there   quoth he  holding down his lanthorn so as to cast its  light on the part of the floor where the panel was fitted  can you not  see how old and crumbled is the stone work which surrounds it  this  opening in the roof is as old as the dungeon itself  and older far  than the door by which you were led into it  for this was one of those  bottle shaped cells or oubliettes which hard men of old devised for the  safe keeping of their captives  once lowered through this hole into the  stone girt pit a man might eat his heart out  for his fate was sealed   yet you see that the very device which once hindered escape has now  brought freedom within your reach       thanks to your clemency  your grace   i answered  looking keenly at my  companion      now out on these disguises   he cried  peevishly pushing back the  broad edged hat and disclosing  as i expected  the features of the duke    even a blunt soldier lad can see through my attempts at concealment   i fear  captain  that i should make a bad plotter  for my nature is as  open  well  as thine is  i cannot better the simile       your grace s voice once heard is not easily forgot   said i      especially when it talks of hemp and dungeons   he answered  with a  smile   but if i clapped you into prison  you must confess that i have  made you amends by pulling you out again at the end of my line  like a  minnow out of a bottle  but how came you to deliver such papers in the  presence of my council       i did what i could to deliver them in private   said i   i sent you a  message to that effect       it is true   he answered   but such messages come in to me from every  soldier who wishes to sell his sword  and every inventor who hath a long  tongue and a short purse  how could i tell that the matter was of real  import       i feared to let the chance slip lest it might never return   said i   i  hear that your grace hath little leisure during these times       i cannot blame you   he answered  pacing up and down the room   but it  was untoward  i might have hid the despatches  yet it would have roused  suspicions  your errand would have leaked out  there are many who envy  my lofty fortunes  and who would seize upon a chance of injuring me with  king james  sunderland or somers would either of them blow the least  rumour into a flame which might prove unquenchable  there was naught for  it  therefore  but to show the papers and to turn a harsh face on the  messenger  the most venomous tongue could not find fault in my conduct   what course would you have advised under such circumstances    the most  direct   i answered   aye  aye  sir  honesty  public men have  however   to pick their steps as best they may  for the straight path would lead  too often to the cliff edge  the tower would be too scanty for its  guests were we all to wear our hearts upon our sleeves  but to you in  this privacy i can tell my real thoughts without fear of betrayal or  misconstruction  on paper i will not write one word  your memory must  be the sheet which bears my answer to monmouth  and first of all  erase  from it all that you have heard me say in the council room  let it be as  though it never were spoken  is that done       i understand that it did not really represent your grace s thoughts       very far from it  captain  but prythee tell me what expectation of  success is there among the rebels themselves  you must have heard your  colonel and others discuss the question  or noted by their bearing which  way their thoughts lay  have they good hopes of holding out against the  king s troops       they have met with naught but success hitherto   i answered      against the militia  but they will find it another thing when they have  trained troops to deal with  and yet  and yet   one thing i know  that  any defeat of feversham s army would cause a general rising throughout  the country  on the other hand  the king s party are active  every  post brings news of some fresh levy  albemarle still holds the militia  together in the west  the earl of pembroke is in arms in wiltshire   lord lumley is moving from the east with the sussex forces  the earl of  abingdon is up in oxfordshire  at the university the caps and gowns are  all turning into head pieces and steel fronts  james s dutch regiments  have sailed from amsterdam  yet monmouth hath gained two fights  and why  not a third  they are troubled waters  troubled waters   the duke paced  backwards and forwards with brows drawn down  muttering all this to  himself rather than to me  and shaking his head like one in the sorest  perplexity      i would have you tell monmouth   he said at last   that i thank him for  the papers which he hath sent me  and that i will duly read and weigh  them  tell him also that i wish him well in his enterprise  and would  help him were it not that i am hemmed in by those who watch me closely   and who would denounce me were i to show my true thoughts  tell him  that  should he move his army into these parts  i may then openly  declare myself  but to do so now would be to ruin the fortunes of my  house  without in any way helping him  can you bear him that message       i shall do so  your grace      tell me   he asked   how doth monmouth bear himself in this  enterprise       like a wise and gallant leader   i answered      strange   he murmured   it was ever the jest at court that he had  scarce energy or constancy enough to finish a game at ball  but would  ever throw his racquet down ere the winning point was scored  his plans  were like a weather vane  altered by every breeze  he was constant  only in his inconstancy  it is true that he led the king s troops in  scotland  but all men knew that claverhouse and dalzell were the real  conquerors at bothwell bridge  methinks he resembles that brutus in  roman history who feigned weakness of mind as a cover to his ambitions      the duke was once again conversing with himself rather than with me  so  that i made no remark  save to observe that monmouth had won the hearts  of the lower people      there lies his strength   said beaufort   the blood of his mother runs  in his veins  he doth not think it beneath him to shake the dirty paw  of jerry the tinker  or to run a race against a bumpkin on the village  green  well  events have shown that he hath been right  these same  bumpkins have stood by him when nobler friends have held aloof  i would  i could see into the future  but you have my message  captain  and  i trust that  if you change it in the delivery  it will be in the  direction of greater warmth and kindliness  it is time now that you  depart  for within three hours the guard is changed  and your escape  will be discovered       but how depart   i asked      through here   he answered  pushing open the casement  and sliding the  rope along the beam in that direction   the rope may be a foot or two  short  but you have extra inches to make matters even  when you have  reached the ground  take the gravel path which turns to the right  and  follow it until it leads you to the high trees which skirt the park  the  seventh of these hath a bough which shoots over the boundary wall  climb  along the bough  drop over upon the other side  and you will find my  own valet waiting with your horse  up with you  and ride  haste  haste   post haste  for the south  by morn you should be well out of danger s  way       my sword   i asked      all your property is there  tell monmouth what i have said  and let him  know that i have used you as kindly as was possible       but what will your grace s council say when they find that i am gone    i asked      pshaw  man  never fret about that  i will off to bristol at daybreak   and give my council enough to think of without their having time to  devote to your fate  the soldiers will but have another instance of  the working of the father of evil  who hath long been thought to have a  weakness for that cell beneath us  faith  if all we hear be true  there  have been horrors enough acted there to call up every devil out of the  pit  but time presses  gently through the casement  so  remember the  message       adieu  your grace   i answered  and seizing the rope slipped rapidly  and noiselessly to the ground  upon which he drew it up and closed the  casement  as i looked round  my eye fell upon the dark narrow slit which  opened into my cell  and through which honest farmer brown had held  converse with me  half an hour ago i had been stretched upon the prison  pallet without a hope or a thought of escape  now i was out in the open  with no hand to stay me  breathing the air of freedom with the prison  and the gallows cast off from me  as the waking man casts off his evil  dreams  such changes shake a man s soul  my children  the heart that can  steel itself against death is softened by the assurance of safety  so  i have known a worthy trader bear up manfully when convinced that his  fortunes had been engulfed in the ocean  but lose all philosophy on  finding that the alarm was false  and that they had come safely through  the danger  for my own part  believing as i do that there is nothing of  chance in the affairs of this world  i felt that i had been exposed to  this trial in order to dispose me to serious thought  and that i had  been saved that i might put those thoughts into effect  as an earnest of  my endeavour to do so i knelt down on the green sward  in the shadow of  the boteler turret  and i prayed that i might come to be of use on  the earth  and that i might be helped to rise above my own wants and  interests  to aid forward whatever of good or noble might be stirring in  my days  it is well nigh fifty years  my dears  since i bowed my spirit  before the great unknown in the moon tinted park of badminton  but i  can truly say that from that day to this the aims which i laid down  for myself have served me as a compass over the dark waters of life  a  compass which i may perchance not always follow  for flesh is weak and  frail  but which hath  at least  been ever present  that i might turn to  it in seasons of doubt and of danger     the path to the right led through groves and past carp ponds for a mile  or more  until i reached the line of trees which skirted the boundary  wall  not a living thing did i see upon my way  save a herd of  fallow deer  which scudded away like swift shadows through the  shimmering moonshine  looking back  the high turrets and gables of the  boteler wing stood out dark and threatening against the starlit sky   having reached the seventh tree  i clambered along the projecting bough  which shot over the park wall  and dropped down upon the other side   where i found my good old dapple grey awaiting me in the charge of a  groom  springing to my saddle  i strapped my sword once more to my side   and galloped off as fast as the four willing feet could carry me on my  return journey     all that night i rode hard without drawing bridle  through sleeping  hamlets  by moon bathed farmhouses  past shining stealthy rivers  and  over birch clad hills  when the eastern sky deepened from pink into  scarlet  and the great sun pushed his rim over the blue north somerset  hills  i was already far upon my journey  it was a sabbath morning  and  from every village rose the sweet tinkling and calling of the bells   i bore no dangerous papers with me now  and might therefore be more  careless as to my route  at one point i was questioned by a keen eyed  toll keeper as to whence i came  but my reply that i was riding direct  from his grace of beaufort put an end to his suspicions  further down   near axbridge  i overtook a grazier who was jogging into wells upon his  sleek cob  with him i rode for some time  and learned that the whole  of north somerset  as well as south  was now in open revolt  and that  wells  shepton mallet  and glastonbury were held by armed volunteers  for king monmouth  the royal forces had all retired west  or east  until  help should come  as i rode through the villages i marked the blue flag  upon the church towers  and the rustics drilling upon the green  without  any sign of trooper or dragoon to uphold the authority of the stuarts     my road lay through shepton mallet  piper s inn  bridgewater  and north  petherton  until in the cool of the evening i pulled up my weary horse  at the cross hands  and saw the towers of taunton in the valley beneath  me  a flagon of beer for the rider  and a sieveful of oats for the  steed  put fresh mettle into both of us  and we were jogging on our way  once more  when there came galloping down the side of the hill about  forty cavaliers  as hard as their horses could carry them  so wild was  their riding that i pulled up  uncertain whether they were friend or  foe  until  as they came whirling towards me  i recognised that the two  officers who rode in front of them were none other than reuben lockarby  and sir gervas jerome  at the sight of me they flung up their hands  and  reuben shot on to his horse s neck  where he sat for a moment astride of  the mane  until the brute tossed him back into the saddle      it s micah  it s micah   he gasped  with his mouth open  and the tears  hopping down his honest face      od s pitlikins  man  how did you come here   asked sir gervas  poking  me with his forefinger as though to see if i were really of flesh and  blood   we were leading a forlorn of horse into beaufort s country to  beat him up  and to burn his fine house about his ears if you had come  to harm  there has just come a groom from some farmer in those parts who  hath brought us news that you were under sentence of death  on which i  came away with my wig half frizzled  and found that friend lockarby had  leave from lord grey to go north with these troopers  but how have you  fared       well and ill   i answered  wringing their kindly hands   i had not  thought last night to see another sun rise  and yet ye see that i am  here  sound in life and limb  but all these things will take some time  in the telling       aye  and king monmouth will be on thorns to see you  right about  my  lads  and back for the camp  never was errand so rapidly and happily  finished as this of ours  it would have fared ill with badminton had you  been hurt      the troopers turned their horses and trotted slowly back to taunton   while i rode behind them between my two faithful friends  hearing from  them all that had occurred in my absence  and telling my own adventures  in return  the night had fallen ere we rode through the gates  where i  handed covenant over to the mayor s groom  and went direct to the castle  to deliver an account of my mission         chapter xxvi  of the strife in the council    king monmouth s council was assembled at the time of my coming  and my  entrance caused the utmost surprise and joy  as they had just heard news  of my sore danger  even the royal presence could not prevent several  members  among whom were the old mayor and the two soldiers of fortune   from springing to their feet and shaking me warmly by the hand  monmouth  himself said a few gracious words  and requested that i should be seated  at the board with the others      you have earned the right to be of our council   said he   and lest  there should be a jealousy amongst other captains that you should come  among us  i do hereby confer upon you the special title of scout master   which  though it entail few if any duties in the present state of our  force  will yet give you precedence over your fellows  we had heard that  your greeting from beaufort was of the roughest  and that you were in  sore straits in his dungeons  but you have happily come yourself on the  very heels of him who bore the tidings  tell us then from the beginning  how things have fared with you      i should have wished to have limited my story to beaufort and his  message  but as the council seemed to be intent upon hearing a full  account of my journey  i told in as short and simple speech as i  could the various passages which had befallen me  the ambuscado of  the smugglers  the cave  the capture of the gauger  the journey in the  lugger  the acquaintance with farmer brown  my being cast into prison   with the manner of my release and the message wherewith i had been  commissioned  to all of this the council hearkened with the uttermost  attention  while a muttered oath ever and anon from a courtier or a  groan and prayer from a puritan showed how keenly they followed the  various phases of my fortunes  above all  they gave the greatest heed  to beaufort s words  and stopped me more than once when i appeared to be  passing over any saying or event before they had due time to weigh  it  when i at last finished they all sat speechless  looking into each  other s faces and waiting for an expression of opinion      on my word   said monmouth at last   this is a young ulysses  though  his odyssey doth but take three days in the acting  scudery might not be  so dull were she to take a hint from these smugglers  caves and sliding  panels  how say you  grey       he hath indeed had his share of adventure   the nobleman answered   and  hath also performed his mission like a fearless and zealous messenger   you say that beaufort gave you nought in writing       not a word  my lord   i replied      and his private message was that he wished us well  and would join us  if we were in his country       that was the effect  my lord       yet in his council  as i understand  he did utter bitter things against  us  putting affronts upon the king  and making light of his just claims  upon the fealty of his nobility       he did   i answered      he would fain stand upon both sides of the hedge at once   said king  monmouth   such a man is very like to find himself on neither side  but  in the very heart of the briars  it may be as well  however  that we  should move his way  so as to give him the chance of declaring himself       in any case  as your majesty remembers   said saxon   we had determined  to march bristolwards and attempt the town       the works are being strengthened   said i   and there are five thousand  of the gloucestershire train bands assembled within  i saw the labourers  at work upon the ramparts as i passed       if we gain beaufort we shall gain the town   quoth sir stephen  timewell   there are already a strong body of godly and honest folk  therein  who would rejoice to see a protestant army within their gates   should we have to beleaguer it we may count upon some help from within       hegel und blitzen   exclaimed the german soldier  with an impatience  which even the presence of the king could not keep in bounds   how can  we talk of sieges and leaguers when we have not a breaching piece in the  army       the lard will find us the breaching pieces   cried ferguson  in his  strange  nasal voice   did the lard no breach the too ers o  jericho  withoot the aid o  gunpooder  did the lard no raise up the man robert  ferguson and presairve him through five and thairty indictments and  twa and twenty proclamations o  the godless  what is there he canna do   hosannah  hosannah       the doctor is right   said a square faced  leather skinned english  independent   we talk too much o  carnal means and worldly chances   without leaning upon that heavenly goodwill which should be to us as a  staff on stony and broken paths  yes  gentlemen   he continued  raising  his voice and glancing across the table at some of the courtiers   ye  may sneer at words of piety  but i say that it is you and those like you  who will bring down god s anger upon this army       and i say so too   cried another sectary fiercely      and i    and i   shouted several  with saxon  i think  among them      is it your wish  your majesty  that we should be insulted at your very  council board   cried one of the courtiers  springing to his feet with  a flushed face   how long are we to be subject to this insolence because  we have the religion of a gentleman  and prefer to practise it in the  privacy of our hearts rather than at the street corners with these  pharisees       speak not against god s saints   cried a puritan  in a loud stern  voice   there is a voice within me which tells me that it were better to  strike thee dead  yea  even in the presence of the king  than to allow  thee to revile those who have been born again      several had sprung to their feet on either side  hands were laid upon  sword hilts  and glances as stern and as deadly as rapier thrusts were  flashing backwards and forwards  but the more neutral and reasonable  members of the council succeeded in restoring peace  and in persuading  the angry disputants to resume their seats      how now  gentlemen   cried the king  his face dark with anger  when  silence was at last restored   is this the extent of my authority that  ye should babble and brawl as though my council chamber were a fleet  street pot house  is this your respect for my person  i tell ye that i  would forfeit my just claims for ever  and return to holland  or devote  my sword to the cause of christianity against the turk  rather than  submit to such indignity  if any man he proved to have stirred up strife  amongst the soldiers or commonalty on the score of religion i shall  know how to deal with him  let each preach to his own  but let him not  interfere with the flock of his neighbour  as to you  mr  bramwell   and you  mr  joyce  and you also  sir henry nuttall  we shall hold ye  excused from attending these meetings until ye have further notice from  us  ye may now separate  each to your quarters  and to morrow morning  we shall  with the blessing of god  start for the north to see what luck  may await our enterprise in those parts      the king bowed as a sign that the formal meeting was over  and taking  lord grey aside  he conversed with him anxiously in a recess  the  courtiers  who numbered in their party several english and foreign  gentlemen  who had come over together with some devonshire and somerset  country squires  swaggered out of the room in a body  with much clinking  of spurs and clanking of swords  the puritans drew gravely together and  followed after them  walking not with demure and downcast looks  as was  their common use  but with grim faces and knitted brows  as the jews of  old may have appeared when   to your tents  o israel   was still ringing  in their ears     indeed  religious dissension and sectarian heat were in the very air   outside  on the castle green  the voices of preachers rose up like the  drone of insects  every waggon or barrel or chance provision case had  been converted into a pulpit  each with its own orator and little knot  of eager hearkeners  here was a russet coated taunton volunteer in  jackboots and bandolier  holding forth on the justification by works   further on a grenadier of the militia  with blazing red coat and white  cross belt  was deep in the mystery of the trinity  in one or two  places  where the rude pulpits were too near to each other  the sermons  had changed into a hot discussion between the two preachers  in which  the audience took part by hums or groans  each applauding the champion  whose creed was most in accordance with his own  through this wild  scene  made more striking by the ruddy flickering glare of the  camp fires  i picked my way with a weight at my heart  for i felt how  vain it must be to hope for success where such division reigned  saxon  looked on  however  with glistening eyes  and rubbed his hands with  satisfaction      the leaven is working   quoth he   something will come of all this  ferment       i see not what can come of it save disorder and weakness   i answered      good soldiers will come of it  lad   said he   they are all sharpening  themselves  each after his own fashion  on the whetstone of religion   this arguing breedeth fanatics  and fanatics are the stuff out of which  conquerors are fashioned  have you not heard how old noll s army divided  into presbyterians  independents  ranters  anabaptists  fifth monarchy  men  brownists  and a score of other sects  out of whose strife rose the  finest regiments that ever formed line upon a field of battle                such as do build their faith upon             the holy text of sword and gun      you know old samuel s couplet  i tell you  i would rather see them thus  employed than at their drill  for all their wrangling and jangling       but how of this split in the council   i asked      ah  that is indeed a graver matter  all creeds may be welded together   but the puritan and the scoffer are like oil and water  yet the puritan  is the oil  for he will be ever atop  these courtiers do but stand for  themselves  while the others are backed up by the pith and marrow of the  army  it is well that we are afoot to morrow  the king s troops are  i  hear  pouring across salisbury plain  but their ordnance and stores are  delaying them  for they know well that they must bring all they need   since they can expect little from the goodwill of the country folk  ah   friend buyse  wie geht es       ganz gut   said the big german  looming up before us through the  darkness   but  sapperment  what a cawing and croaking  like a rookery  at sunset  you english are a strange people  yes  donnerwetter  a very  strange people  there are no two of you who think alike upon any subject  under himmel  the cavalier will have his gay coat and his loose word   the puritan will cut your throat rather than give up his sad coloured  dress and his bible   king james   cry some   king monmouth   say the  peasants   king jesus   says the fifth monarchy man   no king at all    cry master wade and a few others who are for a commonwealth  since i  set foot on the helderenbergh at amsterdam  my head hath been in a whirl  with trying to understand what it is that ye desire  for before i have  got to the end of one man s tale  and begin to see a little through the  finsterniss  another will come with another story  and i am in as evil a  case as ever  but  my young hercules  i am right glad to see you back  in safety  i am half in fear to give you my hand now  after your recent  treatment of it  i trust that you are none the worse for the danger that  you have gone through       mine eyelids are in truth a little heavy   i answered   save for an  hour or two aboard the lugger  and about as long on a prison couch  i  have not closed eye since i left the camp       we shall fall in at the second bugle call  about eight of the clock    said saxon   we shall leave you  therefore  that you may restore  yourself after your fatigues   with a parting nod the two old soldiers  strode off together down the crowded fore street  while i made the best  of my way back to the mayor s hospitable dwelling  where i had to repeat  my story all over again to the assembled household before i was at last  suffered to seek my room         chapter xxvii  of the affair near keynsham bridge    monday  june           broke very dark and windy  with dull clouds  moving heavily across the sky and a constant sputter of rain  yet a  little after daybreak monmouth s bugles were blowing in every quarter  of the town  from tone bridge to shuttern  and by the hour appointed the  regiments had mustered  the roll had been called  and the vanguard was  marching briskly out through the eastern gate  it went forth in the same  order as it entered  our own regiment and the taunton burghers bringing  up the rear  mayor timewell and saxon had the ordering of this part of  the army between them  and being men who had seen much service  they  drew the ordnance into a less hazardous position  and placed a strong  guard of horse  a cannon s shot in the rear  to meet any attempt of the  royal dragoons     it was remarked on all sides that the army had improved in order and  discipline during the three days  halt  owing perchance to the example  of our own unceasing drill and soldierly bearing  in numbers it had  increased to nigh eight thousand  and the men were well fed and light  of heart  with sturdy close locked ranks they splashed their way through  mud and puddle  with many a rough country joke and many a lusty stave  from song or hymn  sir gervas rode at the head of his musqueteers  whose  befloured tails hung limp and lank with the water dripping from  them  lockarby s pikemen and my own company of scythesmen were mostly  labourers from the country  who were hardened against all weathers  and  plodded patiently along with the rain drops glistening upon their ruddy  faces  in front were the taunton foot  behind  the lumbering train of  baggage waggons  with the horse in the rear of them  so the long line  wound its way over the hills     at the summit  where the road begins to dip down upon the other side  a  halt was called to enable the regiments to close up  and we looked back  at the fair town which many of us were never to see again  from the dark  walls and house roofs we could still mark the flapping and flutter of  white kerchiefs from those whom we left behind  reuben sat his horse  beside me  with his spare shirt streaming in the wind and his great  pikemen all agrin behind him  though his thoughts and his eyes were  too far away to note them  as we gazed  a long thin quiver of sunshine  slipped out between two cloud banks and gilded the summit of the  magdalene tower  with the royal standard which still waved from it  the  incident was hailed as a happy augury  and a great shout spread from  rank to rank at the sight of it  with a waving of hats and a clattering  of weapons  then the bugles blew a fanfare  the drums struck up a point  of war  reuben thrust his shirt into his haversack  and on we marched  through mud and slush  with the dreary clouds bending low over us  and  buttressed by the no less dreary hills on either side  a seeker for  omens might have said that the heavens were weeping over our ill fated  venture     all day we trudged along roads which were quagmires  over our ankles  in mud  until in the evening we made our way to bridgewater  where we  gained some recruits  and also some hundred pounds for our military  chest  for it was a well to do place  with a thriving coast trade  carried on down the river parret  after a night in snug quarters we set  off again in even worse weather than before  the country in these parts  is a quagmire in the driest season  but the heavy rains had caused the  fens to overflow  and turned them into broad lakes on either side of the  road  this may have been to some degree in our favour  as shielding us  from the raids of the king s cavalry  but it made our march very  slow  all day it was splashing and swashing through mud and mire  the  rain drops shining on the gun barrels and dripping from the heavy footed  horses  past the swollen parret  through eastover  by the peaceful  village of bawdrip  and over polden hill we made our way  until the  bugles sounded a halt under the groves of ashcot  and a rude meal was  served out to the men  then on again  through the pitiless rain  past  the wooded park of piper s inn  through walton  where the floods were  threatening the cottages  past the orchards of street  and so in the  dusk of the evening into the grey old town of glastonbury  where the  good folk did their best by the warmth of their welcome to atone for the  bitterness of the weather     the next morning was wet still and inclement  so the army made a short  march to wells  which is a good sized town  well laid out  with a fine  cathedral  which hath a great number of figures carved in stone and  placed in niches on the outer side  like that which we saw at salisbury   the townsfolk were strong for the protestant cause  and the army was so  well received that their victual cost little from the military chest  on  this march we first began to come into touch with the royal horse  more  than once when the rain mist cleared we saw the gleam of arms upon the  low hills which overlook the road  and our scouts came in with reports  of strong bodies of dragoons on either flank  at one time they massed  heavily upon our rear  as though planning a descent upon the baggage   saxon  however  planted a regiment of pikes on either side  so that they  broke up again and glinted off over the hills     from wells we marched upon the twenty fourth to shepton mallet  with the  ominous sabres and helmets still twinkling behind and on either side of  us     that evening we were at keynsham bridge  less than two leagues from  bristol as the crow flies  and some of our horse forded the river and  pushed on almost to the walls     by morning the rain clouds had at last cleared  so reuben and i rode  slowly up one of the sloping green hills which rose behind the camp  in  the hope of gaining some sight of the enemy  our men we left littered  about upon the grass  trying to light fires with the damp sticks  or  laying out their clothes to dry in the sunshine  a strange looking band  they were  coated and splashed with mud from head to heel  their hats  all limp and draggled  their arms rusted  and their boots so worn that  many walked barefoot  and others had swathed their kerchiefs round  their feet  yet their short spell of soldiering had changed them  from honest faced yokels into fierce eyed  half shaven  gaunt cheeked  fellows  who could carry arms or port pikes as though they had done  nought else since childhood     the plight of the officers was no better than that of the men  nor  should an officer  my dears  when he is upon service  ever demean  himself by partaking of any comfort which all cannot share with him  let  him lie by a soldier s fire and eat a soldier s fare  or let him hence   for he is a hindrance and a stumbling block  our clothes were pulp  our  steel fronts red with rust  and our chargers as stained and splashed as  though they had rolled in the mire  our very swords and pistols were in  such a plight that we could scarce draw the one or snap the other  sir  gervas alone succeeded in keeping his attire and his person as neat and  as dainty as ever  what he did in the watches of the night  and how he  gained his sleep  hath ever been a mystery to me  for day after day  he turned out at the bugle call  washed  scented  brushed  with wig  in order  and clothes from which every speck of mud had been carefully  removed  at his saddle bow he bore with him the great flour dredger  which we saw him use at taunton  and his honest musqueteers had their  heads duly dusted every morning  though in an hour their tails would  be as brown as nature made them  while the flour would be trickling in  little milky streams down their broad backs  or forming in cakes upon  the skirts of their coats  it was a long contest between the weather and  the baronet  but our comrade proved the victor      there was a time when i was called plump reuben   quoth my friend  as  we rode together up the winding track   what with too little that is  solid and too much that is liquid i am like to be skeleton reuben ere i  see havant again  i am as full of rain water as my father s casks are of  october  i would  micah  that you would wring me out and hang me to dry  upon one of these bushes       if we are wet  king james s men must be wetter   said i   for at least  we have had such shelter as there was       it is poor comfort when you are starved to know that another is in  the same plight  i give you my word  micah  i took in one hole of my  sword belt on monday  two on tuesday  one yesterday  and one to day  i  tell you  i am thawing like an icicle in the sun       if you should chance to dwindle to nought   said i  laughing   what  account are we to give of you in taunton  since you have donned armour  and taken to winning the hearts of fair maidens  you have outstripped us  all in importance  and become a man of weight and substance       i had more substance and weight ere i began trailing over the  countryside like a hambledon packman   quoth he   but in very truth and  with all gravity  micah  it is a strange thing to feel that the whole  world for you  your hopes  your ambitions  your all  are gathered into  so small a compass that a hood might cover it  and two little pattens  support it  i feel as if she were my own higher self  my loftier  part  and that i  should i be torn from her  would remain for ever an  incomplete and half formed being  with her  i ask nothing else  without  her  all else is nothing       but have you spoken to the old man   i asked   are you indeed  betrothed       i have spoken to him   my friend answered   but he was so busy in  filling ammunition cases that i could not gain his attention  when i  tried once more he was counting the spare pikes in the castle armoury  with a tally and an ink horn  i told him that i had come to crave his  granddaughter s hand  on which he turned to me and asked   which hand    with so blank a stare that it was clear that his mind was elsewhere  on  the third trial  though  the day that you did come back from badminton   i did at last prefer my request  but he flashed out at me that this was  no time for such fooleries  and he bade me wait until king monmouth was  on the throne  when i might ask him again  i warrant that he did not  call such things fooleries fifty years ago  when he went a courting  himself       at least he did not refuse you   said i   it is as good as a promise  that  should the cause be successful  you shall be so too       by my faith   cried reuben   if a man could by his own single blade  bring that about  there is none who hath so strong an interest in it as  i  no  not monmouth himself  the apprentice derrick hath for a long time  raised his eyes to his master s daughter  and the old man was ready to  have him as a son  so much was he taken by his godliness and zeal  yet i  have learned from a side wind that he is but a debauched and low living  man  though he covers his pleasures with a mask of piety  i thought as  you did think that he was at the head of the roisterers who tried to  bear mistress ruth away  though  i  faith  i can scarce think harshly  of them  since they did me the greatest service that ever men did yet   meanwhile i have taken occasion  ere we left wells two nights ago  to  speak to master derrick on the matter  and to warn him as he loved his  life to plan no treachery against her      and how took he this mild intimation   i asked      as a rat takes a rat trap  snarled out some few words of godly hatred   and so slunk away       on my life  lad   said i   you have been having as many adventures in  your own way as i in mine  but here we are upon the hill top  with as  fair an outlook as man could wish to have      just beneath us ran the avon  curving in long bends through the  woodlands  with the gleam of the sun striking back from it here and  there  as though a row of baby suns had been set upon a silver string   on the further side the peaceful  many hued country  rising and falling  in a swell of cornfields and orchards  swept away to break in a fringe  of forest upon the distant malverns  on our right were the green hills  near bath and on our left the rugged mendips  with queenly bristol  crouching behind her forts  and the grey channel behind flecked with  snow white sails  at our very feet lay keynsham bridge  and our army  spotted in dark patches over the green fields  the smoke of their fires  and the babble of their voices floating up in the still summer air     a road ran along the somersetshire bank of the avon  and down this two  troops of our horse were advancing  with intent to establish outposts  upon our eastern flank  as they jangled past in somewhat loose order   their course lay through a pine wood  into which the road takes a sharp  bend  we were gazing down at the scene when  like lightning from a  cloud  a troop of the horse guards wheeled out into the open  and  breaking from trot to canter  and from canter to gallop  dashed down in  a whirlwind of blue and steel upon our unprepared squadrons  a crackle  of hastily unslung carbines broke from the leading ranks  but in an  instant the guards burst through them and plunged on into the second  troop  for a space the gallant rustics held their own  and the dense  mass of men and horses swayed backwards and forwards  with the swirling  sword blades playing above them in flashes of angry light  then blue  coats began to break from among the russet  the fight rolled wildly back  for a hundred paces  the dense throng was split asunder  and the royal  guards came pouring through the rent  and swerved off to right and left  through hedges and over ditches  stabbing and hacking at the fleeing  horsemen  the whole scene  with the stamping horses  tossing manes   shouts of triumph or despair  gasping of hard drawn breath and musical  clink and clatter of steel  was to us upon the hill like some wild  vision  so swiftly did it come and so swiftly go  a sharp  stern  bugle call summoned the blues back into the road  where they formed up  and trotted slowly away before fresh squadrons could come up from the  camp  the sun gleamed and the river rippled as ever  and there was  nothing save the long litter of men and horses to mark the course of the  hell blast which had broken so suddenly upon us     as the blues retired we observed that a single officer brought up the  rear  riding very slowly  as though it went much against his mood to  turn his back even to an army  the space betwixt the troop and him was  steadily growing greater  yet he made no effort to quicken his pace   but jogged quietly on  looking back from time to time to see if he were  followed  the same thought sprang into my comrade s mind and my own at  the same instant  and we read it in each other s faces      this path   cried he eagerly   it brings us out beyond the grove  and  is in the hollow all the way       lead the horses until we get on better ground   i answered   we may  just cut him off if we are lucky      there was no time for another word  for we hurried off down the uneven  track  sliding and slipping on the rain soaked turf  springing into our  saddles we dashed down the gorge  through the grove  and so out on to  the road in time to see the troop disappear in the distance  and to meet  the solitary officer face to face     he was a sun burned  high featured man  with black mustachios  mounted  on a great raw boned chestnut charger  as we broke out on to the road he  pulled up to have a good look at us  then  having fully made up his mind  as to our hostile intent  he drew his sword  plucked a pistol out of his  holster with his left hand  and gripping the bridle between his teeth   dug his spurs into his horse s flanks and charged down upon us at the  top of his speed  as we dashed at him  reuben on his bridle arm and i  on the other  he cut fiercely at me  and at the same moment fired at my  companion  the ball grazed reuben s cheek  leaving a red weal behind it  like a lash from a whip  and blackening his face with the powder  his  cut  however  fell short  and throwing my arm round his waist as the two  horses dashed past each other  i plucked him from the saddle and drew  him face upwards across my saddlebow  brave covenant lumbered on with  his double burden  and before the guards had learned that they had lost  their officer  we had brought him safe  in spite of his struggles and  writhings  to within sight of monmouth s camp      a narrow shave  friend   quoth reuben  with his hand to his cheek   he  hath tattooed my face with powder until i shall be taken for solomon  sprent s younger brother       thank god that you are unhurt   said i   see  our horse are advancing  along the upper road  lord grey himself rides at their head  we had best  take our prisoner into camp  since we can do nought here       for christ s sake  either slay me or set me down   he cried   i cannot  bear to be carried in this plight  like a half weaned infant  through  your campful of grinning yokels       i would not make sport of a brave man   i answered   if you will give  your word to stay with us  you shall walk between us       willingly   said he  scrambling down and arranging his ruffled attire    by my faith  sirs  ye have taught me a lesson not to think too meanly  of mine enemies  i should have ridden with my troop had i thought that  there was a chance of falling in with outposts or videttes       we were upon the hill before we cut you off   quoth reuben   had that  pistol ball been a thought straighter  it is i that should have been  truly the cut off one  zounds  micah  i was grumbling even now that i  had fallen away  but had my cheek been as round as of old the slug had  been through it       where have i seen you before   asked our captive  bending his dark  eyes upon me   aye  i have it  it was in the inn at salisbury  where  my light headed comrade horsford did draw upon an old soldier who was  riding with you  mine own name is ogilvy  major ogilvy of the horse  guards blue  i was right glad that ye did come off safely from the  hounds  some word had come of your errand after your departure  so this  same horsford with the mayor and one or two other tantivies  whose zeal  methinks outran their humanity  slipped the dogs upon your trail       i remember you well   i answered   you will find colonel decimus saxon   my former companion  in the camp  no doubt you will be shortly exchanged  for some prisoner of ours       much more likely to have my throat cut   said he  with a smile   i  fear that feversham in his present temper will scarce pause to make  prisoners  and monmouth may be tempted to pay him back in his own  coin  yet it is the fortune of war  and i should pay for my want of all  soldierly caution  truth to tell  my mind was far from battles and ruses  at the moment  for it had wandered away to aqua regia and its action  upon the metals  until your appearance brought me back to soldiership       the horse are out of sight   said reuben  looking backwards   ours as  well as theirs  yet i see a clump of men over yonder at the other side  of the avon  and there on the hillside can you not see the gleam of  steel       there are foot there   i answered  puckering my eyes   it seems to me  that i can discern four or five regiments and as many colours of horse   king monmouth should know of this with all speed       he does know of it   said reuben   yonder he stands under the trees  with his council about him  see  one of them rides this way      a trooper had indeed detached himself from the group and galloped  towards us   if you are captain clarke  sir   he said  with a salute    the king orders you to join his council       then i leave the major in your keeping  reuben   i cried   see that  he hath what our means allow   so saying i spurred my horse  and soon  joined the group who were gathered round the king  there were grey   wade  buyse  ferguson  saxon  hollis  and a score more  all looking very  grave  and peering down the valley with their glasses  monmouth himself  had dismounted  and was leaning against the trunk of a tree  with his  arms folded upon his breast  and a look of white despair upon his face   behind the tree a lackey paced up and down leading his glossy black  charger  who pranced and tossed his lordly mane  a very king among  horses      you see  friends   said monmouth  turning lack lustre eyes from one  leader to another   providence would seem to be against us  some new  mishap is ever at our heels       not providence  your majesty  but our own negligence   cried saxon  boldly   had we advanced on bristol last night  we might have been on  the right side of the ramparts by now       but we had no thought that the enemy s foot was so near   exclaimed  wade      i told ye what would come of it  and so did oberst buyse and the worthy  mayor of taunton   saxon answered   however  there is nought to be  gained by mourning over a broken pipkin  we must e en piece it together  as best we may       let us advance on bristol  and put oor trust in the highest   quoth  ferguson   if it be his mighty will that we should tak  it  then  shall we enter into it  yea  though drakes and sakers lay as thick as  cobblestanes in the streets       aye  aye  on to bristol  god with us   cried several of the puritans  excitedly      but it is madness  dummheit  utter foolishness   buyse broke in hotly    you have the chance and you will not take it  now the chance is gone  and you are all eager to go  here is an army of  as near as i can judge   five thousand men on the right side of the river  we are on the wrong  side  and yet you talk of crossing and making a beleaguering of bristol  without breaching pieces or spades  and with this force in our rear   will the town make terms when they can see from their ramparts the van  of the army which comes to help them  or does it assist us in fighting  the army to have a strong town beside us  from which horse and foot can  make an outfall upon our flank  i say again that it is madness      what the german soldier said was so clearly the truth that even the  fanatics were silenced  away in the east the long shimmering lines  of steel  and the patches of scarlet upon the green hillside  were  arguments which the most thoughtless could not overlook      what would you advise  then   asked monmouth moodily  tapping his  jewelled riding whip against his high boots      to cross the river and come to hand grips with them ere they can  get help from the town   the burly german answered bluntly   i cannot  understand what we are here for if it be not to fight  if we win  the  town must fall  if we lose  we have had a bold stroke for it  and can do  no more       is that your opinion  too  colonel saxon   the king asked      assuredly  your majesty  if we can fight to advantage  we can scarce  do that  however  by crossing the river on a single narrow bridge in  the face of such a force  i should advise that we destroy this keynsham  bridge  and march down this southern bank in the hope of forcing a fight  in a position which we may choose       we have not yet summoned bath   said wade   let us do as colonel saxon  proposes  and let us in the meantime march in that direction and send a  trumpet to the governor       there is yet another plan   quoth sir stephen timewell   which is to  hasten to gloucester  to cross the severn there  and so march through  worcestershire into shropshire and cheshire  your majesty has many  friends in those parts      monmouth paced up and down with his hand to his forehead like one  distrait   what am i to do   he cried at last   in the midst of all this  conflicting advice  when i know that not only my own success  but the  lives of these poor faithful peasants and craftsmen depend upon my  resolution       with all humbleness  your majesty   said lord grey  who had just  returned with the horse   i should suggest  since there are only a few  troops of their cavalry on this side of the avon  that we blow up the  bridge and move onwards to bath  whence we can pass into wiltshire   which we know to be friendly       so be it   cried the king  with the reckless air of one who accepts  a plan  not because it is the best  but because he feels that all are  equally hopeless   what think you  gentlemen   he added  with a bitter  smile   i have heard news from london this morning  that my uncle has  clapped two hundred merchants and others who are suspected of being true  to their creed into the tower and the fleet  he will have one half of  the nation mounting guard over the other half ere long       or the whole  your majesty  mounting guard over him   suggested wade    he may himself see the traitor s gate some of these mornings       ha  ha  think ye so  think ye so   cried monmouth  rubbing his hands  and brightening into a smile   well  mayhap you have nicked the truth   who knows  henry s cause seemed a losing one until bosworth field  settled the contention  to your charges  gentlemen  we shall march in  half an hour  colonel saxon and you  sir stephen  shall cover the rear  and guard the baggage  a service of honour with this fringe of horse  upon our skirts      the council broke up forthwith  every man riding off to his own  regiment  the whole camp was in a stir  bugles blowing and drums  rattling  until in a very short time the army was drawn up in order  and  the forlorn of cavalry had already started along the road which leads to  bath  five hundred horse with the devonshire militiamen were in the van   after them in order came the sailor regiment  the north somerset men   the first taunton regiment of burghers  the mendip and bagworthy miners   the lace and wool workers of honiton  wellington  and ottery st  mary   the woodmen  the graziers  the marsh men  and the men from the quantock  district  behind were the guns and the baggage  with our own brigade and  four colours of horse as a rearguard  on our march we could see the red  coats of feversham keeping pace with us upon the other side of the avon   a large body of his horse and dragoons had forded the stream and hovered  upon our skirts  but saxon and sir stephen covered the baggage so  skilfully  and faced round so fiercely with such a snarl of musketry  whenever they came too nigh  that they never ventured to charge home         chapter xxviii  of the fight in wells cathedral    i am fairly tied to the chariot wheels of history now  my dear children   and must follow on with name and place and date  whether my tale suffer  by it or no  with such a drama as this afoot it were impertinent to  speak of myself  save in so far as i saw or heard what may make these  old scenes more vivid to you  it is no pleasant matter for me to dwell  upon  yet  convinced as i am that there is no such thing as chance  either in the great or the little things of this world  i am very sure  that the sacrifices of these brave men were not thrown away  and that  their strivings were not as profitless as might at first sight appear   if the perfidious race of stuart is not now seated upon the throne  and  if religion in england is still a thing of free growth  we may  to my  thinking  thank these somerset yokels for it  who first showed how small  a thing would shake the throne of an unpopular monarch  monmouth s  army was but the vanguard of that which marched throe years later into  london  when james and his cruel ministers were flying as outcasts over  the face of the earth     on the night of june     or rather early in the morning of june     we  reached the town of frome  very wet and miserable  for the rain had come  on again  and all the roads were quagmires  from this next day we pushed  on once more to wells  where we spent the night and the whole of the  next day  to give the men time to get their clothes dry  and to recover  themselves after their privations     in the forenoon a parade of our wiltshire regiment was held in the  cathedral close  when monmouth praised it  as it well deserved  for the  soldierly progress made in so short a time     as we returned to our quarters after dismissing our men we came upon a  great throng of the rough bagworthy and oare miners  who were assembled  in the open space in front of the cathedral  listening to one of their  own number  who was addressing them from a cart  the wild and frenzied  gestures of the man showed us that he was one of those extreme sectaries  whose religion runs perilously near to madness  the hums and groans  which rose from the crowd proved  however  that his fiery words were  well suited to his hearers  so we halted on the verge of the multitude  and hearkened to his address  a red bearded  fierce faced man he was   with tangled shaggy hair tumbling over his gleaming eyes  and a hoarse  voice which resounded over the whole square      what shall we not do for the lord   he cried   what shall we not do for  the holy of holies  why is it that his hand is heavy upon us  why is it  that we have not freed this land  even as judith freed bethulia  behold   we have looked for peace but no good came  and for a time of health  and  behold trouble  why is this  i say  truly  brothers  it is because we  have slighted the lord  because we have not been wholehearted towards  him  lo  we have praised him with our breath  but in our deeds we have  been cold towards him  ye know well that prelacy is an accursed thing  a  hissing and an abomination in the eyes of the almighty  yet what have  we  his servants  wrought for him in this matter  have we not seen  prelatist churches  churches of form and of show  where the creature is  confounded with the creator  have we not seen them  i say  and have we  not forborne to sweep them away  and so lent our sanction to them  there  is the sin of a lukewarm and back sliding generation  there is the cause  why the lord should look coldly upon his people  lo  at shepton and at  frome we have left such churches behind us  at glastonbury  too  we have  spared those wicked walls which were reared by idolatrous hands of old   woe unto ye  if  after having put your hands to god s plough  ye turn  back from the work  see there   he howled  facing round to the beautiful  cathedral   what means this great heap of stones  is it not an altar of  baal  is it not built for man worship rather than god worship  is it not  there that the man ken  tricked out in his foolish rochet and baubles   may preach his soulless and lying doctrines  which are but the old dish  of popery served up under a new cover  and shall we suffer this thing   shall we  the chosen children of the great one  allow this plague spot  to remain  can we expect the almighty to help us when we will not  stretch out a hand to help him  we have left the other temples of  prelacy behind us  shall we leave this one  too  my brothers       no  no   yelled the crowd  tossing and swaying      shall we pluck it down  then  until no one stone is left upon another       yes  yes   they shouted      now  at once       yes  yes       then to work   he cried  and springing from the cart he rushed towards  the cathedral  with the whole mob of wild fanatics at his heels  some  crowded in  shouting and yelling  through the open doors  while others  swarmed up the pillars and pedestals of the front  hacking at the  sculptured ornaments  and tugging at the grey old images which filled  every niche      this must be stopped   said saxon curtly   we cannot afford to insult  and estray the whole church of england to please a few hot headed  ranters  the pillage of this cathedral would do our cause more harm than  a pitched battle lost  do you bring up your company  sir gervas  and we  shall do what we can to hold them in check until they come       hi  masterton   cried the baronet  spying one of his under officers  among the crowd who were looking on  neither assisting nor opposing the  rioters   do you hasten to the quarters  and tell barker to bring up the  company with their matches burning  i may be of use here       ha  here is buyse   cried saxon joyously  as the huge german ploughed  his way through the crowd   and lord grey  too  we must save the  cathedral  my lord  they would sack and burn it       this way  gentlemen   cried an old grey haired man  running out towards  us with hands outspread  and a bunch of keys clanking at his girdle   oh  hasten  gentlemen  if ye can indeed prevail over these lawless men  they  have pulled down saint peter  and they will have paul down too unless  help comes  there will not be an apostle left  the east window is  broken  they have brought a hogshead of beer  and are broaching it  upon the high altar  oh  alas  alas  that such things should be in a  christian land   he sobbed aloud and stamped about in a very frenzy of  grief      it is the verger  sirs   said one of the townsfolk   he hath grown grey  in the cathedral       this way to the vestry door  my lords and gentlemen   cried the old  man  pushing a way strenuously through the crowd   now  lack a day  the  sainted paul hath gone too      as he spoke a splintering crash from inside the cathedral announced some  fresh outrage on the part of the zealots  our guide hastened on with  renewed speed  until he came to a low oaken door heavily arched  which  he unlocked with much rasping of wards and creaking of hinges  through  this we sidled as best we might  and hurried after the old man down a  stone flagged corridor  which led through a wicket into the cathedral  close by the high altar     the great building was full of the rioters  who were rushing hither and  thither  destroying and breaking everything which they could lay their  hands on  a good number of these were genuine zealots  the followers of  the preacher whom we had listened to outside  others  however  were on  the face of them mere rogues and thieves  such as gather round every  army upon the march  while the former were tearing down images from the  walls  or hurling the books of common prayer through the stained glass  windows  the others were rooting up the massive brass candlesticks   and carrying away everything which promised to be of value  one ragged  fellow was in the pulpit  tearing off the crimson velvet and hurling it  down among the crowd  another had upset the reading desk  and was busily  engaged in wrenching off the brazen fastenings  in the centre of  the side aisle a small group had a rope round the neck of mark the  evangelist  and were dragging lustily upon it  until  even as we  entered  the statue  after tottering for a few moments  came crashing  down upon the marble floor  the shouts which greeted every fresh  outrage  with the splintering of woodwork  the smashing of windows  and  the clatter of falling masonry  made up a most deafening uproar  which  was increased by the droning of the organ  until some of the rioters  silenced it by slitting up the bellows     what more immediately concerned ourselves was the scene which was being  enacted just in front of us at the high altar  a barrel of beer had been  placed upon it  and a dozen ruffians gathered round it  one of whom with  many ribald jests had climbed up  and was engaged in knocking in the  top of the cask with a hatchet  as we entered he had just succeeded in  broaching it  and the brown mead was foaming over  while the mob with  roars of laughter were passing up their dippers and pannikins  the  german soldier rapped out a rough jagged oath at this spectacle  and  shouldering his way through the roisterers he sprang upon the altar   the ringleader was bending over his cask  black jack in hand  when the  soldier s iron grip fell upon his collar  and in a moment his heels were  flapping in the air  and his head three feet deep in the cask  while the  beer splashed and foamed in every direction  with a mighty heave buyse  picked up the barrel with the half drowned miner inside  and hurled it  clattering down the broad marble steps which led from the body of the  church  at the same time  with the aid of a dozen of our men who had  followed us into the cathedral  we drove back the fellow s comrades  and  thrust them out beyond the rails which divided the choir from the nave     our inroad had the effect of checking the riot  but it simply did so by  turning the fury of the zealots from the walls and windows to ourselves   images  stone work  and wood carvings were all abandoned  and the whole  swarm came rushing up with a hoarse buzz of rage  all discipline and  order completely lost in their religious frenzy   smite the prelatists    they howled   down with the friends of antichrist  cut them off even at  the horns of the altar  down with them   on either side they massed  a  wild  half demented crowd  some with arms and some without  but filled  to a man with the very spirit of murder      this is a civil war within a civil war   said lord grey  with a quiet  smile   we had best draw  gentlemen  and defend the gap in the rails  if  we may hold it good until help arrives   he flashed out his rapier as  he spoke  and took his stand on the top of the steps  with saxon and sir  gervas upon one side of him  buyse  reuben  and myself upon the other   there was only room for six to wield their weapons with effect  so our  scanty band of followers scattered themselves along the line of the  rails  which were luckily so high and strong as to make an escalado  difficult in the face of any opposition     the riot had now changed into open mutiny among these marshmen and  miners  pikes  scythes  and knives glimmered through the dim light   while their wild cries re echoed from the high arched roof like the  howling of a pack of wolves   go forward  my brothers   cried the  fanatic preacher  who had been the cause of the outbreak   go forward  against them  what though they be in high places  there is one who  is higher than they  shall we shrink from his work because of a naked  sword  shall we suffer the prelatist altar to be preserved by these sons  of amalek  on  on  in the name of the lord       in the name of the lord   cried the crowd  with a sort of hissing gasp   like one who is about to plunge into an icy bath   in the name of the  lord   from either side they came on  gathering speed and volume  until  at last with a wild cry they surged right down upon our sword points     i can say nothing of what took place to right or left of me during the  ruffle  for indeed there were so many pressing upon us  and the fight  was so hot  that it was all that each of us could do to hold our own   the very number of our assailants was in our favour  by hampering their  sword arms  one burly miner cut fiercely at me with his scythe  but  missing me he swung half round with the force of the blow  and i passed  my sword through his body before he could recover himself  it was the  first time that i had ever slain a man in anger  my dear children  and  i shall never forget his white startled face as he looked over his  shoulder at me ere he fell  another closed in with me before i could get  my weapon disengaged  but i struck him out with my left hand  and then  brought the flat of my sword upon his head  laying him senseless  upon the pavement  god knows  i did not wish to take the lives of the  misguided and ignorant zealots  but our own were at stake  a marshman   looking more like a shaggy wild beast than a human being  darted under  my weapon and caught me round the knees  while another brought a flail  down upon my head piece  from which it glanced on to my shoulder  a  third thrust at me with a pike  and pricked me on the thigh  but i shore  his weapon in two with one blow  and split his head with the next  the  man with the flail gave back at sight of this  and a kick freed me from  the unarmed ape like creature at my feet  so that i found myself clear  of my assailants  and none the worse for my encounter  save for a touch  on the leg and some stiffness of the neck and shoulder     looking round i found that my comrades had also beaten off those who  were opposed to them  saxon was holding his bloody rapier in his left  hand  while the blood was trickling from a slight wound upon his right   two miners lay across each other in front of him  but at the feet of  sir gervas jerome no fewer than four bodies were piled together  he had  plucked out his snuff box as i glanced at him  and was offering it with  a bow and a flourish to lord grey  as unconcernedly as though he were  back once more in his london coffee house  buyse leaned upon his long  broadsword  and looked gloomily at a headless trunk in front of him   which i recognised from the dress as being that of the preacher  as to  reuben  he was unhurt himself  but in sore distress over my own trifling  scar  though i assured the faithful lad that it was a less thing than  many a tear from branch or thorn which we had had when blackberrying  together     the fanatics  though driven back  were not men to be content with a  single repulse  they had lost ten of their number  including their  leader  without being able to break our line  but the failure only  served to increase their fury  for a minute or so they gathered panting  in the aisle  then with a mad yell they dashed in once more  and made a  desperate effort to cut a way through to the altar  it was a fiercer and  more prolonged struggle than before  one of our followers was stabbed to  the heart over the rails  and fell without a groan  another was stunned  by a mass of masonry hurled at him by a giant cragsman  reuben was  felled by a club  and would have been dragged out and hacked to pieces  had i not stood over him and beaten off his assailants  sir gervas was  borne off his legs by the rush  but lay like a wounded wildcat  striking  out furiously at everything which came within his reach  buyse and  saxon  back to back  stood firm amidst the seething  rushing crowd   cutting down every man within sweep of their swords  yet in such a  struggle numbers must in the end prevail  and i confess that i for one  had begun to have fears for the upshot of our contest  when the heavy  tramp of disciplined feet rang through the cathedral  and the baronet s  musqueteers came at a quick run up the central aisle  the fanatics did  not await their charge  but darted off over benches and pews  followed  by our allies  who were furious on seeing their beloved captain upon the  ground  there was a wild minute or two  with confused shuffling of feet   stabs  groans  and the clatter of musket butts on the marble floor  of  the rioters some were slain  but the greater part threw down their arms  and were arrested at the command of lord grey  while a strong guard was  placed at the gates to prevent any fresh outburst of sectarian fury     when at last the cathedral was cleared and order restored  we had time  to look around us and to reckon our own injuries  in all my wanderings   and the many wars in which i afterwards fought  wars compared to which  this affair of monmouth s was but the merest skirmish  i have never seen  a stranger or more impressive scene  in the dim  solemn light the pile  of bodies in front of the rails  with their twisted limbs and white set  faces  had a most sad and ghost like aspect  the evening light  shining  through one of the few unbroken stained glass windows  cast great  splotches of vivid crimson and of sickly green upon the heap of  motionless figures  a few wounded men sat about in the front pews or lay  upon the steps moaning for water  of our own small company not one had  escaped unscathed  three of our followers had been slain outright  while  a fourth was lying stunned from a blow  buyse and sir gervas were much  bruised  saxon was cut on the right arm  reuben had been felled by a  bludgeon stroke  and would certainly have been slain but for the fine  temper of sir jacob clancing s breastplate  which had turned a fierce  pike thrust  as to myself it is scarce worth the mention  but my head  sang for some hours like a good wife s kettle  and my boot was full of  blood  which may have been a blessing in disguise  for sneckson  our  havant barber  was ever dinning into my ears how much the better i  should be for a phlebotomy     in the meantime all the troops had assembled and the mutiny been swiftly  stamped out  there were doubtless many among the puritans who had no  love for the prelatists  but none save the most crack brained fanatics  could fail to see that the sacking of the cathedral would set the  whole church of england in arms  and ruin the cause for which they were  fighting  as it was  much damage had been done  for whilst the gang  within had been smashing all which they could lay their hands upon   others outside had chipped off cornices and gargoyles  and had even  dragged the lead covering from the roof and hurled it down in great  sheets to their companions beneath  this last led to some profit  for  the army had no great store of ammunition  so the lead was gathered up  by monmouth s orders and recast into bullets  the prisoners were held  in custody for a time  but it was deemed unwise to punish them  so that  they were finally pardoned and dismissed from the army     a parade of our whole force was held in the fields outside the town upon  the second day of our stay at wells  the weather having at last become  warm and sunny  the foot was then found to muster six regiments of nine  hundred men  or five thousand four hundred in all  of these fifteen  hundred were musqueteers  two thousand were pikemen  and the rest were  scythesmen or peasants with flails and hammers  a few bodies  such as  our own or those from taunton  might fairly lay claim to be soldiers   but the most of them were still labourers and craftsmen with weapons  in their hands  yet  ill armed and ill drilled as they were  they were  still strong robust englishmen  full of native courage and of religious  zeal  the light and fickle monmouth began to take heart once more at the  sight of their sturdy bearing  and at the sound of their hearty cheers   i heard him as i sat my horse beside his staff speak exultantly to those  around him  and ask whether these fine fellows could possibly be beaten  by mercenary half hearted hirelings      what say you  wade   he cried   are we never to see a smile on that sad  face of yours  do you not see a woolsack in store for you as you look  upon these brave fellows       god forbid that i should say a word to damp your majesty s ardour   the  lawyer answered   yet i cannot but remember that there was a time when  your majesty  at the head of these same hirelings  did drive men as  brave as these in headlong rout from bothwell bridge       true  true   said the king  passing his hand over his forehead  a  favourite motion when he was worried and annoyed   they were bold men   the western covenanters  yet they could not stand against the rush of  our battalions  but they had had no training  whereas these can fight in  line and fire a platoon as well as one would wish to see       if we hadna a gun nor a patronal among us   said ferguson   if we hadna  sae muckle as a sword  but just oor ain honds  yet would the lard gie us  the victory  if it seemed good in his a  seeing een       all battles are but chance work  your majesty   remarked saxon  whose  sword arm was bound round with his kerchief   some lucky turn  some slip  or chance which none can foresee  is ever likely to turn the scale  i  have lost when i have looked to win  and i have won when i have looked  to lose  it is an uncertain game  and one never knows the finish till  the last card is played       not till the stakes are drawn   said buyse  in his deep guttural voice    there is many a leader that wins what you call the trick  and yet loses  the game       the trick being the battle and the game the campaign   quoth the king   with a smile   our german friend is a master of camp fire metaphors  but  methinks our poor horses are in a sorry state  what would cousin william  over at the hague  with his spruce guards  think of such a show as  this      during this talk the long column of foot had tramped past  still bearing  the banners which they had brought with them to the wars  though much  the worse for wind and weather  monmouth s remarks had been drawn forth  by the aspect of the ten troops of horse which followed  the chargers  had been sadly worn by the continued work and constant rain  while the  riders  having allowed their caps and fronts to get coated with rust   appeared to be in as bad a plight as their steeds  it was clear to the  least experienced of us that if we were to hold our own it was upon  our foot that we must rely  on the tops of the low hills all round the  frequent shimmer of arms  glancing here and there when the sun s rays  struck upon them  showed how strong our enemies were in the very point  in which we were so weak  yet in the main this wells review was cheering  to us  as showing that the men kept in good heart  and that there was no  ill feeling at the rough handling of the zealots upon the day before     the enemy s horse hovered about us during these days  but the foot had  been delayed through the heavy weather and the swollen streams  on the  last day of june we marched out of wells  and made our way across flat  sedgy plains and over the low polden hills to bridgewater  where we  found some few recruits awaiting us  here monmouth had some thoughts  of making a stand  and even set to work raising earthworks  but it was  pointed out to him that  even could he hold the town  there was not more  than a few days  provisions within it  while the country round had been  already swept so bare that little more could be expected from it  the  works were therefore abandoned  and  fairly driven to bay  without a  loophole of escape left  we awaited the approach of the enemy         chapter xxix  of the great cry from the lonely house    and so our weary marching and counter marching came at last to an end   and we found ourselves with our backs fairly against the wall  and the  whole strength of the government turned against us  not a word came  to us of a rising or movement in our favour in any part of england   everywhere the dissenters were cast into prison and the church dominant   from north and east and west the militia of the counties was on its  march against us  in london six regiments of dutch troops had arrived as  a loan from the prince of orange  others were said to be on their way   the city had enrolled ten thousand men  everywhere there was mustering  and marching to succour the flower of the english army  which was  already in somersetshire  and all for the purpose of crushing some five  or six thousand clodhoppers and fishermen  half armed and penniless  who  were ready to throw their lives away for a man and for an idea     but this idea  my dear children  was a noble one  and one which a man  might very well sacrifice all for  and yet feel that all was well spent   for though these poor peasants  in their dumb  blundering fashion  would  have found it hard to give all their reasons in words  yet in the inmost  heart of them they knew and felt that it was england s cause which they  were fighting for  and that they were upholding their country s true  self against those who would alter the old systems under which she had  led the nations  three more years made all this very plain  and showed  that our simple unlettered followers had seen and judged the signs of  the times more correctly than those who called themselves their betters   there are  to my thinking  stages of human progress for which the church  of rome is admirably suited  where the mind of a nation is young  it may  be best that it should not concern itself with spiritual affairs  but  should lean upon the old staff of custom and authority  but england had  cast off her swaddling clothes  and was a nursery of strong  thinking  men  who would bow to no authority save that which their reason and  conscience approved  it was hopeless  useless  foolish  to try to drive  such men back into a creed which they had outgrown  such an attempt was   however  being made  backed by all the weight of a bigoted king with a  powerful and wealthy church as his ally  in three years the nation would  understand it  and the king would be flying from his angry people  but  at present  sunk in a torpor after the long civil wars and the corrupt  reign of charles  they failed to see what was at stake  and turned  against those who would warn them  as a hasty man turns on the messenger  who is the bearer of evil tidings  is it not strange  my dears  how  quickly a mere shadowy thought comes to take living form  and grow into  a very tragic reality  at one end of the chain is a king brooding over a  point of doctrine  at the other are six thousand desperate men  chivied  and chased from shire to shire  standing to bay at last amid the bleak  bridgewater marshes  with their hearts as bitter and as hopeless as  those of hunted beasts of prey  a king s theology is a dangerous thing  for his subjects     but if the idea for which these poor men fought was a worthy one  what  shall we say of the man who had been chosen as the champion of their  cause  alas  that such men should have had such a leader  swinging from  the heights of confidence to the depths of despair  choosing his future  council of state one day and proposing to fly from the army on the  next  he appeared from the start to be possessed by the very spirit  of fickleness  yet he had borne a fair name before this enterprise  in  scotland he had won golden opinions  not only for his success  but for  the moderation and mercy with which he treated the vanquished  on the  continent he had commanded an english brigade in a way that earned  praise from old soldiers of louis and the empire  yet now  when his own  head and his own fortunes were at stake  he was feeble  irresolute  and  cowardly  in my father s phrase   all the virtue had gone out of him    i declare when i have seen him riding among his troops  with his head  bowed upon his breast and a face like a mute at a burying  casting an  air of gloom and of despair all round him  i have felt that  even in  case of success  such a man could never wear the crown of the tudors and  the plantagenets  but that some stronger hand  were it that of one of  his own generals  would wrest it from him     i will do monmouth the justice to say that from the time when it was at  last decided to fight  for the very good reason that no other course was  open  he showed up in a more soldierly and manlier spirit  for the first  few days in july no means were neglected to hearten our troops and to  nerve them for the coming battle  from morning to night we were at work   teaching our foot how to form up in dense groups to meet the charge of  horse  and how to depend upon each other  and look to their officers for  orders  at night the streets of the little town from the castle field  to the parret bridge resounded with the praying and the preaching  there  was no need for the officers to quell irregularities  for the troops  punished them amongst themselves  one man who came out on the streets  hot with wine was well nigh hanged by his companions  who finally cast  him out of the town as being unworthy to fight in what they looked  upon as a sacred quarrel  as to their courage  there was no occasion to  quicken that  for they were as fearless as lions  and the only danger  was lest their fiery daring should lead them into foolhardiness  their  desire was to hurl themselves upon the enemy like a horde of moslem  fanatics  and it was no easy matter to drill such hot headed fellows  into the steadiness and caution which war demands     provisions ran low upon the third day of our stay in bridgewater  which  was due to our having exhausted that part of the country before  and  also to the vigilance of the royal horse  who scoured the district round  and cut off our supplies  lord grey determined  therefore  to send  out two troops of horse under cover of night  to do what they could to  refill the larder  the command of the small expedition was given over  to major martin hooker  an old lifeguardsman of rough speech and curt  manners  who had done good service in drilling the headstrong farmers  and yeomen into some sort of order  sir gervas jerome and i asked leave  from lord grey to join the foray  a favour which was readily granted   since there was little stirring in the town     it was about eleven o clock on a moonless night that we sallied out  of bridgewater  intending to explore the country in the direction of  boroughbridge and athelney  we had word that there was no large body  of the enemy in that quarter  and it was a fertile district where  good store of supplies might be hoped for  we took with us four empty  waggons  to carry whatever we might have the luck to find  our commander  arranged that one troop should ride before these and one behind  while a  small advance party  under the charge of sir gervas  kept some hundreds  of paces in front  in this order we clattered out of the town just as  the late bugles were blowing  and swept away down the quiet shadowy  roads  bringing anxious peering faces to the casements of the wayside  cottages as we whirled past in the darkness     that ride comes very clearly before me as i think of it  the dark loom  of the club headed willows flitting by us  the moaning of the breeze  among the withies  the vague  blurred figures of the troopers  the dull  thud of the hoofs  and the jingling of scabbard against stirrup  eye and  ear can both conjure up those old time memories  the baronet and i rode  in front  knee against knee  and his light hearted chatter of life in  town  with his little snatches of verse or song from cowley or waller   were a very balm of gilead to my sombre and somewhat heavy spirit      life is indeed life on such a night as this   quoth he  as we breathed  in the fresh country air with the reeks of crops and of kine   rabbit  me  but you are to be envied  clarke  for having been born and bred in  the country  what pleasures has the town to offer compared to the free  gifts of nature  provided always that there be a perruquier s and  a snuff merchant s  and a scent vendor s  and one or two tolerable  outfitters within reach  with these and a good coffee house and a  playhouse  i think i could make shift to lead a simple pastoral life for  some months       in the country   said i  laughing   we have ever the feeling that the  true life of mankind  with the growth of knowledge and wisdom  are being  wrought out in the towns       ventre saint gris  it was little knowledge or wisdom that i acquired  there   he answered   truth to tell  i have lived more and learned more  during these few weeks that we have been sliding about in the rain with  our ragged lads  than ever i did when i was page of the court  with the  ball of fortune at my feet  it is a sorry thing for a man s mind to have  nothing higher to dwell upon than the turning of a compliment or the  dancing of a corranto  zounds  lad  i have your friend the carpenter to  thank for much  as he says in his letter  unless a man can get the good  that is in him out  he is of loss value in the world than one of those  fowls that we hear cackling  for they at least fulfill their mission  if  it be only to lay eggs  ged  it is a new creed for me to be preaching       but   said i   when you were a wealthy man you must have been of  service to some one  for how could one spend so much money and yet none  be the better       you dear bucolic micah   he cried  with a gay laugh   you will ever  speak of my poor fortune with bated breath and in an awestruck voice  as  though it were the wealth of the indies  you cannot think  lad  how easy  it is for a money bag to take unto itself wings and fly  it is true that  the man who spends it doth not consume the money  but passes it on to  some one who profits thereby  yet the fault lies in the fact that it was  to the wrong folk that we passed our money  thereby breeding a useless  and debauched class at the expense of honest callings  od s fish  lad   when i think of the swarms of needy beggars  the lecherous pimps  the  nose slitting bullies  the toadies and the flatterers who were reared by  us  i feel that in hatching such a poisonous brood our money hath done  what no money can undo  have i not seen them thirty deep of a morning  when i have held my levee  cringing up to my bedside        your bedside   i exclaimed      aye  it was the mode to receive in bed  attired in laced cambric  shirt and periwig  though afterwards it was permitted to sit up in your  chamber  but dressed  a la negligence   in gown and slippers  the mode  is a terrible tyrant  clarke  though its arm may not extend as far as  havant  the idle man of the town must have some rule of life  so he  becomes a slave to the law of the fashions  no man in london was more  subject to it than myself  i was regular in my irregularities  and  orderly in my disorders  at eleven o clock to the stroke  up came my  valet with the morning cup of hippocras  an excellent thing for the  qualms  and some slight refection  as the breast of an ortolan or wing  of a widgeon  then came the levee  twenty  thirty  or forty of the class  i have spoken of  though now and then perhaps there might be some honest  case of want among them  some needy man of letters in quest of a guinea   or pupil less pedant with much ancient learning in his head and very  little modern coinage in his pocket  it was not only that i had some  power of mine own  but i was known to have the ear of my lord halifax   sidney godolphin  lawrence hyde  and others whose will might make or mar  a man  mark you those lights upon the left  would it not be well to see  if there is not something to be had there       hooker hath orders to proceed to a certain farm   i answered   this we  could take upon our return should we still have space  we shall be back  here before morning       we must get supplies  if i have to ride back to surrey for them   said  he   rat me  if i dare look my musqueteers in the face again unless i  bring them something to toast upon the end of their ramrods  they had  little more savoury than their own bullets to put in their mouths when  i left them  but i was speaking of old days in london  our time was  well filled  should a man of quality incline to sport there was ever  something to attract him  he might see sword playing at hockley  or  cocking at shoe lane  or baiting at southwark  or shooting at tothill  fields  again  he might walk in the physic gardens of st  james s  or go  down the river with the ebb tide to the cherry orchards at rotherhithe   or drive to islington to drink the cream  or  above all  walk in the  park  which is most modish for a gentleman who dresses in the fashion   you see  clarke  that we were active in our idleness  and that there was  no lack of employment  then as evening came on there were the playhouses  to draw us  dorset gardens  lincoln s inn  drury lane  and the  queen s  among the four there was ever some amusement to be found       there  at least  your time was well employed   said i   you could  not hearken to the grand thoughts or lofty words of shakespeare or of  massinger without feeling some image of them in your own soul      sir gervas chuckled quietly   you are as fresh to me  micah  as this  sweet country air   said he   know  thou dear babe  that it was not to  see the play that we frequented the playhouse       then why  in heaven s name   i asked      to see each other   he answered   it was the mode  i assure you  for a  man of fashion to stand with his back turned to the stage from the  rise of the curtain to the fall of it  there were the orange wenches to  quiz  plaguey sharp of tongue the hussies are  too  and there were the  vizards of the pit  whose little black masks did invite inquiry  and  there were the beauties of the town and the toasts of the court   all fair mark for our quizzing glasses  play  indeed  s bud  we had  something better to do than to listen to alexandrines or weigh the  merits of hexameters   tis true that if la jeune were dancing  or if  mrs  bracegirdle or mrs  oldfield came upon the boards  we would hum  and clap  but it was the fine woman that we applauded rather than the  actress       and when the play was over you went doubtless to supper and so to bed       to supper  certainly  sometimes to the rhenish house  sometimes to  pontack s in abchurch lane  every one had his own taste in that matter   then there were dice and cards at the groom porter s or under the arches  at covent garden  piquet  passage  hazard  primero  what you choose   after that you could find all the world at the coffee houses  where an  arriere supper was often served with devilled bones and prunes  to drive  the fumes of wine from the head  zounds  micah  if the jews should relax  their pressure  or if this war brings us any luck  you shall come to  town with me and shall see all these things for yourself       truth to tell  it doth not tempt me much   i answered   slow and solemn  i am by nature  and in such scenes as you have described i should feel a  very death s head at a banquet      sir gervas was about to reply  when of a sudden out of the silence  of the night there rose a long drawn piercing scream  which thrilled  through every nerve of our bodies  i have never heard such a wail of  despair  we pulled up our horses  as did the troopers behind us  and  strained our ears for some sign as to whence the sound proceeded  for  some were of opinion that it came from our right and some from our left   the main body with the waggons had come up  and we all listened intently  for any return of the terrible cry  presently it broke upon us again   wild  shrill  and agonised  the scream of a woman in mortal distress      tis over there  major hooker   cried sir gervas  standing up in his  stirrups and peering through the darkness   there is a house about two  fields off  i can see some glimmer  as from a window with the blind  drawn       shall we not make for it at once   i asked impatiently  for our  commander sat stolidly upon his horse as though by no means sure what  course he should pursue      i am here  captain clarke   said he   to convey supplies to the army   and i am by no means justified in turning from my course to pursue other  adventures       death  man  there is a woman in distress   cried sir gervas   why   major  you would not ride past and let her call in vain for help  hark   there she is again   as he spoke the wild scream rang out once more from  the lonely house      nay  i can abide this no longer   i cried  my blood boiling in my  veins   do you go on your errand  major hooker  and my friend and i  shall leave you here  we shall know how to justify our action to the  king  come  sir gervas       mark ye  this is flat mutiny  captain clarke   said hooker   you are  under my orders  and should you desert me you do so at your peril       in such a case i care not a groat for thy orders   i answered hotly   turning covenant i spurred down a narrow  deeply rutted lane which  led towards the house  followed by sir gervas and two or three of the  troopers  at the same moment i heard a sharp word of command from hooker  and the creaking of wheels  showing that he had indeed abandoned us and  proceeded on his mission      he is right   quoth the baronet  as we rode down the lane   saxon or  any other old soldier would commend his discipline       there are things which are higher than discipline   i muttered    i could not pass on and leave this poor soul in her distress  but  see  what have we here      a dark mass loomed in front of us  which proved as we approached to be  four horses fastened by their bridles to the hedge      cavalry horses  captain clarke   cried one of the troopers who had  sprung down to examine them   they have the government saddle and  holsters  here is a wooden gate which opens on a pathway leading to the  house       we had best dismount  then   said sir gervas  jumping down and tying  his horse beside the others   do you  lads  stay by the horses  and if  we call for ye come to our aid  sergeant holloway  you can come with us   bring your pistols with you          chapter xxx  of the swordsman with the brown jacket    the sergeant  who was a great raw boned west countryman  pushed the gate  open  and we were advancing up the winding pathway  when a stream of  yellow light flooded out from a suddenly opened door  and we saw a dark  squat figure dart through it into the inside of the house  at the same  moment there rose up a babel of sounds  followed by two pistol shots   and a roaring  gasping hubbub  with clash of swords and storm of oaths   at this sudden uproar we all three ran at our topmost speed up the  pathway and peered in through the open door  where we saw a scene such  as i shall never forget while this old memory of mine can conjure up any  picture of the past     the room was large and lofty  with long rows of hams and salted meats  dangling from the smoke browned rafters  as is usual in somersetshire  farmhouses  a high black clock ticked in a corner  and a rude table   with plates and dishes laid out as for a meal  stood in the centre   right in front of the door a great fire of wood faggots was blazing  and  before this  to our unutterable horror  there hung a man head downwards   suspended by a rope which was knotted round his ankles  and which   passing over a hook in a beam  had been made fast to a ring in the  floor  the struggles of this unhappy man had caused the rope to whirl  round  so that he was spinning in front of the blaze like a joint  of meat  across the threshold lay a woman  the one whose cries had  attracted us  but her rigid face and twisted body showed that our  aid had come too late to save her from the fate which she had seen  impending  close by her two swarthy dragoons in the glaring red coats of  the royal army lay stretched across each other upon the floor  dark and  scowling even in death  in the centre of the room two other dragoons  were cutting and stabbing with their broad swords at a thick  short   heavy shouldered man  clad in coarse brown kersey stuff  who sprang  about among the chairs and round the table with a long basket hilted  rapier in his hand  parrying or dodging their blows with wonderful  adroitness  and every now and then putting in a thrust in return   hard pressed as he was  his set resolute face  firm mouth  and bright  well opened eyes spoke of a bold spirit within  while the blood which  dripped from the sleeve of one of his opponents proved that the contest  was not so unequal as it might appear  even as we gazed he sprang back  to avoid a fierce rush of the furious soldiers  and by a quick sharp  side stroke he severed the rope by which the victim was hung  the body  fell with a heavy thud upon the brick floor  while the little swordsman  danced off in a moment into another quarter of the room  still stopping  or avoiding with the utmost ease and skill the shower of blows which  rained upon him     this strange scene held us spell bound for a few seconds  but there was  no time for delay  for a slip or trip would prove fatal to the gallant  stranger  rushing into the chamber  sword in hand  we fell upon the  dragoons  who  outnumbered as they were  backed into a corner and struck  out fiercely  knowing that they need expect no mercy after the devil s  work in which they had been engaged  holloway  our sergeant of horse   springing furiously in  laid himself open to a thrust which stretched  him dead upon the ground  before the dragoon could disengage his weapon   sir gervas cut him down  while at the same moment the stranger got past  the guard of his antagonist  and wounded him mortally in the throat   of the four red coats not one escaped alive  while the bodies of our  sergeant and of the old couple who had been the first victims increased  the horror of the scene      poor holloway is gone   said i  placing my hand over his heart   who  ever saw such a shambles  i feel sick and ill       here is eau de vie  if i mistake not   cried the stranger  clambering  up on a chair and reaching a bottle from the shelf   good  too  by the  smell  take a sup  for you are as white as a new bleached sheet       honest warfare i can abide  but scenes like this make my blood run  cold   i answered  taking a gulp from the flask  i was a very young  soldier then  my dears  but i confess that to the end of my campaigns  any form of cruelty had the same effect upon me  i give you my word that  when i went to london last fall the sight of an overworked  raw backed  cart horse straining with its load  and flogged for not doing that which  it could not do  gave me greater qualms than did the field of sedgemoor   or that greater day when ten thousand of the flower of france lay  stretched before the earthworks of landen      the woman is dead   said sir gervas   and the man is also  i fear  past  recovery  he is not burned  but suffers  i should judge  poor devil   from the rush of blood to the head       if that be all it may well be cured   remarked the stranger  and taking  a small knife from his pocket  he rolled up the old man s sleeve and  opened one of his veins  at first only a few sluggish black drops oozed  from the wound  but presently the blood began to flow more freely  and  the injured man showed signs of returning sense      he will live   said the little swordsman  putting his lancet back in  his pocket   and now  who may you be to whom i owe this interference  which shortened the affair  though mayhap the result would have been the  same had you left us to settle it amongst ourselves       we are from monmouth s army   i answered   he lies at bridgewater  and  we are scouting and seeking supplies       and who are you   asked sir gervas   and how came you into this  ruffle  s bud  you are a game little rooster to fight four such great  cockerels       my name is hector marot   the man answered  cleaning out his empty  pistols and very carefully reloading them   as to who i am  it is a  matter of small moment  suffice it that i have helped to lessen kirk s  horse by four of his rogues  mark their faces  so dusky and sun dried  even in death  these men have learned warfare fighting against the  heathen in africa  and now they practise on poor harmless english folk  the devil s tricks which they have picked up amongst the savages  the  lord help monmouth s men should they be beaten  these vermin are more to  be feared than hangman s cord or headsman s axe       but how did you chance upon the spot at the very nick of time   i  asked      why  marry  i was jogging down the road on my mare when i heard the  clatter of hoofs behind me  and concealing myself in a field  as a  prudent man would while the country is in its present state  i saw these  four rogues gallop past  they made their way up to the farmhouse  here  and presently from cries and other tokens i knew what manner of  hell fire business they had on hand  on that i left my mare in the field  and ran up  when i saw them through the casement  tricing the good man  up in front of his fire to make him confess where his wealth lay hidden   though indeed it is my own belief that neither he nor any other farmer  in these parts hath any wealth left to hide  after two armies have been  quartered in turn upon them  finding that his mouth remained closed   they ran him up  as you saw  and would assuredly have toasted him like a  snipe  had i not stepped in and winged two of them with my barkers  the  others set upon me  but i pinked one through the forearm  and should  doubtless have given a good account of both of them but for your  incoming       right gallantly done   i exclaimed   but where have i heard your name  before  mr  hector marot       nay   he answered  with a sharp  sidelong look   i cannot tell that       it is familiar to mine ear   said i     he shrugged his broad shoulders  and continued to look to the priming  of his pistols  with a half defiant and half uneasy expression  he was  a very sturdy  deep chested man  with a stern  square jawed face  and a  white seam across his bronzed forehead as from a slash with a knife  he  wore a gold edged riding cap  a jacket of brown sad coloured stuff much  stained by the weather  a pair of high rusty jack boots  and a small  bob wig     sir gervas  who had been staring very hard at the man  suddenly gave a  start  and slapped his hand against his leg      of course   he cried   sink me  if i could remember where i had seen  your face  but now it comes back to me very clearly      the man glanced doggedly from under his bent brows at each of us  in turn   it seems that i have fallen among acquaintances   he said  gruffly   yet i have no memory of ye  methinks  young sirs  that your  fancy doth play ye false       not a whit   the baronet answered quietly  and  bending forward  he  whispered a few words into the man s ear  which caused him to spring  from his seat and take a couple of quick strides forward  as though to  escape from the house      nay  nay   cried sir gervas  springing between him and the door   you  shall not run away from us  pshaw  man  never lay your hand upon your  sword  we have had bloody work enough for one night  besides  we would  not harm you       what mean ye  then  what would ye have   he asked  glancing about like  some fierce wild beast in a trap      i have a most kindly feeling to you  man  after this night s work    cried sir gervas   what is it to me how ye pick up a living  as long as  you are a true man at heart  let me perish if i ever forget a face which  i have once seen  and your bonne mine  with the trade mark upon your  forehead  is especially hard to overlook       suppose i be the same  what then   the man asked sullenly      there is no suppose in the matter  i could swear to you  but i would  not  lad  not if i caught you red handed  you must know  clarke  since  there is none to overhear us  that in the old days i was a justice of  the peace in surrey  and that our friend here was brought up before me  on a charge of riding somewhat late o  night  and of being plaguey short  with travellers  you will understand me  he was referred to assizes  but  got away in the meanwhile  and so saved his neck  right glad i am of  it  for you will agree with me that he is too proper a man to give a  tight rope dance at tyburn       and i remember well now where i have heard your name   said i   were  you not a captive in the duke of beaufort s prison at badminton  and did  you not succeed in escaping from the old boteler dungeon       nay  gentlemen   he replied  seating himself on the edge of the table   and carelessly swinging his legs   since ye know so much it would be  folly for me to attempt to deceive ye  i am indeed the same hector marot  who hath made his name a terror on the great western road  and who hath  seen the inside of more prisons than any man in the south  with truth   however  i can say that though i have been ten years upon the roads  i  have never yet taken a groat from the poor  or injured any man who did  not wish to injure me  on the contrary  i have often risked life and  limb to save those who were in trouble       we can bear you out in that   i answered   for if these four red coat  devils have paid the price of their crimes  it is your doing rather than  ours       nay  i can take little credit for that   our new acquaintance answered    indeed  i had other scores to settle with colonel kirke s horse  and  was but too glad to have this breather with them      whilst we were talking the men whom we had left with the horses had come  up  together with some of the neighbouring farmers and cottagers  who  were aghast at the scene of slaughter  and much troubled in their minds  over the vengeance which might be exacted by the royal troops next day      for christ s zake  zur   cried one of them  an old ruddy faced  countryman   move the bodies o  these soldier rogues into the road  and  let it zeem as how they have perished in a chance fight wi  your own  troopers loike  should it be known as they have met their end within  a varmhouse  there will not be a thatch left unlighted over t  whole  country side  as it is  us can scarce keep these murthering tangiers  devils from oor throats       his request is in reason   said the highwayman bluntly   we have no  right to have our fun  and then go our way leaving others to pay the  score       well  hark ye   said sir gervas  turning to the group of frightened  rustics   i ll strike a bargain with ye over the matter  we have come  out for supplies  and can scarce go back empty handed  if ye will among  ye provide us with a cart  filling it with such breadstuffs and greens  as ye may  with a dozen bullocks as well  we shall not only screen ye in  this matter  but i shall promise payment at fair market rates if ye will  come to the protestant camp for the money       i ll spare the bullocks   quoth the old man whom we had rescued  who  was now sufficiently recovered to sit up   zince my poor dame is foully  murthered it matters little to me what becomes o  the stock  i shall  zee her laid in durston graveyard  and shall then vollow you to t  camp   where i shall die happy if i can but rid the earth o  one more o  these  incarnate devils       you say well  gaffer   cried hector marot   you show the true spirit   methinks i see an old birding piece on yonder hooks  which  with a brace  of slugs in it and a bold man behind it  might bring down one of these  fine birds for all their gay feathers       her s been a true mate to me for more n thirty year   said the old man   the tears coursing down his wrinkled cheeks   thirty zeed toimes and  thirty harvests we ve worked together  but this is a zeed toime which  shall have a harvest o  blood if my right hand can compass it       if you go to t  wars  gaffer swain  we ll look to your homestead    said the farmer who had spoken before   as to t  greenstuffs as this  gentleman asks for he shall have not one wainload but three  if he will  but gi  us half an hour to fill them up  if he does not tak them t   others will  so we had raither that they go to the good cause  here   miles  do you wak the labourers  and zee that they throw the potato  store wi  the spinach and the dried meats into the waggons wi  all  speed       then we had best set about our part of the contract   said hector  marot  with the aid of our troopers he carried out the four dragoons and  our dead sergeant  and laid them on the ground some way down the lane   leading the horses all round and between their bodies  so as to trample  the earth  and bear out the idea of a cavalry skirmish  while this was  doing  some of the labourers had washed down the brick floor of the  kitchen and removed all traces of the tragedy  the murdered woman had  been carried up to her own chamber  so that nothing was left to recall  what had occurred  save the unhappy farmer  who sat moodily in the same  place  with his chin resting upon his stringy work worn hands  staring  out in front of him with a stony  empty gaze  unconscious apparently of  all that was going on around him     the loading of the waggons had been quickly accomplished  and the little  drove of oxen gathered from a neighbouring field  we were just starting  upon our return journey when a young countryman rode up  with the news  that a troop of the royal horse were between the camp and ourselves   this was grave tidings  for we were but seven all told  and our pace was  necessarily slow whilst we were hampered with the supplies      how about hooker   i suggested   should we not send after him and give  him warning       i ll goo at once   said the countryman   i m bound to zee him if he be  on the athelney road   so saying he set spurs to his horse and galloped  off through the darkness      while we have such volunteer scouts as this   i remarked   it is easy  to see which side the country folk have in their hearts  hooker hath  still the better part of two troops with him  so surely he can hold his  own  but how are we to make our way back       zounds  clarke  let us extemporise a fortress   suggested sir gervas    we could hold this farmhouse against all comers until hooker returns   and then join our forces to his  now would our redoubtable colonel be in  his glory  to have a chance of devising cross fires  and flanking fires   with all the other refinements of a well conducted leaguer       nay   i answered   after leaving major hooker in a somewhat cavalier  fashion  it would be a bitter thing to have to ask his help now that  there is danger       ho  ho   cried the baronet   it does not take a very deep lead line  to come to the bottom of your stoical philosophy  friend micah  for all  your cold blooded stolidity you are keen enough where pride or honour is  concerned  shall we then ride onwards  and chance it  i ll lay an even  crown that we never as much as see a red coat       if you will take my advice  gentlemen   said the highwayman  trotting  up upon a beautiful bay mare   i should say that your best course is to  allow me to act as guide to you as far as the camp  it will be strange  if i cannot find roads which shall baffle these blundering soldiers       a very wise and seasonable proposition   cried sir gervas   master  marot  a pinch from my snuff box  which is ever a covenant of friendship  with its owner  adslidikins  man  though our acquaintance at present  is limited to my having nearly hanged you on one occasion  yet i have  a kindly feeling towards you  though i wish you had some more savoury  trade       so do many who ride o  night   marot answered  with a chuckle   but we  had best start  for the east is whitening  and it will be daylight ere  we come to bridgewater      leaving the ill omened farmhouse behind us we set off with all military  precautions  marot riding with me some distance in front  while two of  the troopers covered the rear  it was still very dark  though a thin  grey line on the horizon showed that the dawn was not far off  in spite  of the gloom  however  our new acquaintance guided us without a moment s  halt or hesitation through a network of lanes and bypaths  across fields  and over bogs  where the waggons were sometimes up to their axles in  bog  and sometimes were groaning and straining over rocks and stones  so  frequent were our turnings  and so often did we change the direction of  our advance  that i feared more than once that our guide was at fault   yet  when at last the first rays of the sun brightened the landscape we  saw the steeple of bridgewater parish church shooting up right in front  of us      zounds  man  you must have something of the cat in you to pick your way  so in the dark   cried sir gervas  riding up to us   i am right glad to  see the town  for my poor waggons have been creaking and straining until  my ears are weary with listening for the snap of the axle bar  master  marot  we owe you something for this       is this your own particular district   i asked   or have you a like  knowledge of every part of the south       my range   said he  lighting his short  black pipe   is from kent to  cornwall  though never north of the thames or bristol channel  through  that district there is no road which is not familiar to me  nor as much  as a break in the hedge which i could not find in blackest midnight  it  is my calling  but the trade is not what it was  if i had a son i should  not bring him up to it  it hath been spoiled by the armed guards to  the mail coaches  and by the accursed goldsmiths  who have opened their  banks and so taken the hard money into their strong boxes  giving out  instead slips of paper  which are as useless to us as an old newsletter   i give ye my word that only a week gone last friday i stopped a grazier  coming from blandford fair  and i took seven hundred guineas off him in  these paper cheques  as they call them  enough  had it been in gold  to  have lasted me for a three month rouse  truly the country is coming to a  pretty pass when such trash as that is allowed to take the place of the  king s coinage       why should you persevere in such a trade   said i   your own knowledge  must tell you that it can only lead to ruin and the gallows  have you  ever known one who has thriven at it       that have i   he answered readily   there was kingston jones  who  worked hounslow for many a year  he took ten thousand yellow boys on  one job  and  like a wise man  he vowed never to risk his neck again   he went into cheshire  with some tale of having newly arrived from the  indies  bought an estate  and is now a flourishing country gentleman of  good repute  and a justice of the peace into the bargain  zounds  man   to see him on the bench  condemning some poor devil for stealing a dozen  eggs  is as good as a comedy in the playhouse       nay  but   i persisted   you are a man  judging from what we have seen  of your courage and skill in the use of your weapons  who would gain  speedy preferment in any army  surely it were better to use your gifts  to the gaining of honour and credit  than to make them a stepping stone  to disgrace and the gallows       for the gallows i care not a clipped shilling   the highwayman  answered  sending up thick blue curls of smoke into the morning air   we  have all to pay nature s debt  and whether i do it in my boots or on a  feather bed  in one year or in ten  matters as little to me as to any  soldier among you  as to disgrace  it is a matter of opinion  i see  no shame myself in taking a toll upon the wealth of the rich  since i  freely expose my own skin in the doing of it       there is a right and there is a wrong   i answered   which no words  can do away with  and it is a dangerous and unprofitable trick to juggle  with them       besides  even if what you have said were true as to property   sir  gervas remarked   it would not hold you excused for that recklessness of  human life which your trade begets       nay  it is but hunting  save that your quarry may at any time turn  round upon you  and become in turn the hunter  it is  as you say  a  dangerous game  but two can play at it  and each has an equal chance   there is no loading of the dice  or throwing of fulhams  now it was but  a few days back that  riding down the high road  i perceived three jolly  farmers at full gallop across the fields with a leash of dogs yelping in  front of them  and all in pursuit of one little harmless bunny  it was  a bare and unpeopled countryside on the border of exmoor  so i bethought  me that i could not employ my leisure better than by chasing the  chasers  odd s wouns  it was a proper hunt  away went my gentlemen   whooping like madmen  with their coat skirts flapping in the breeze   chivying on the dogs  and having a rare morning s sport  they never  marked the quiet horseman who rode behind them  and who without a   yoick   or  hark a way   was relishing his chase with the loudest of  them  it needed but a posse of peace officers at my heels to make up a  brave string of us  catch who catch can  like the game the lads play on  the village green       and what came of it   i asked  for our new acquaintance was laughing  silently to himself      well  my three friends ran down their hare  and pulled out their  flasks  as men who had done a good stroke of work  they were still  hobnobbing and laughing over the slaughtered bunny  and one had  dismounted to cut off its ears as the prize of their chase  when i came  up at a hand gallop   good morrow  gentlemen   said i   we have had rare  sport   they looked at me blankly enough  i promise you  and one of  them asked me what the devil i did there  and how i dared to join in a  private sport   nay  i was not chasing your hare  gentlemen   said i    what then  fellow   asked one of them   why  marry  i was chasing you    i answered   and a better run i have not had for years   with that i  lugged out my persuaders  and made the thing clear in a few words  and  i ll warrant you would have laughed could you have seen their faces as  they slowly dragged the fat leather purses from their fobs  seventy one  pounds was my prize that morning  which was better worth riding for than  a hare s ears       did they not raise the country on your track   i asked      nay  when brown alice is given her head she flies faster than the news   rumour spreads quick  but the good mare s stride is quicker still       and here we are within our own outposts   quoth sir gervas   now  mine  honest friend  for honest you have been to us  whatever others may  say of you  will you not come with us  and strike in for a good cause   zounds  man  you have many an ill deed to atone for  i ll warrant   why not add one good one to your account  by risking your life for the  reformed faith       not i   the highwayman answered  reining up his horse   my own skin is  nothing  but why should i risk my mare in such a fool s quarrel  should  she come to harm in the ruffle  where could i get such another  besides   it matters nothing to her whether papist or protestant sits on the  throne of england  does it  my beauty       but you might chance to gain preferment   i said   our colonel  decimus  saxon  is one who loves a good swordsman  and his word hath power with  king monmouth and the council       nay  nay   cried hector marot gruffly   let every man stick to his own  trade  kirke s horse i am ever ready to have a brush with  for a party  of them hung old blind jim houston of milverton  who was a friend of  mine  i have sent seven of the red handed rogues to their last account  for it  and might work through the whole regiment had i time  but i will  not fight against king james  nor will i risk the mare  so let me hear  no more of it  and now i must leave ye  for i have much to do  farewell  to you       farewell  farewell   we cried  pressing his brown horny hands   our  thanks to you for your guidance   raising his hat  he shook his bridle  and galloped off down the road in a rolling cloud of dust      rat me  if i ever say a word against the thieves again   said sir  gervas   i never saw a man wield sword more deftly in my life  and he  must be a rare hand with a pistol to bring those two tall fellows down  with two shots  but look over there  clarke  can you not see bodies of  red coats       surely i can   i answered  gazing out over the broad  reedy   dead coloured plain  which extended from the other side of the winding  parret to the distant polden hills   i can see them over yonder in the  direction of westonzoyland  as bright as the poppies among corn       there are more upon the left  near chedzoy   quoth sir gervas   one   two  three  and one yonder  and two others behind  six regiments of foot  in all  methinks i see the breastplates of horse over there  and some  sign of ordnance too  faith  monmouth must fight now  if he ever hopes  to feel the gold rim upon his temples  the whole of king james s army  hath closed upon him       we must get back to our command  then   i answered   if i mistake not   i see the flutter of our standards in the market place   we spurred our  weary steeds forward  and made our way with our little party and the  supplies which we had collected  until we found ourselves back in  our quarters  where we were hailed by the lusty cheers of our hungry  comrades  before noon the drove of bullocks had been changed into joints  and steaks  while our green stuff and other victuals had helped to  furnish the last dinner which many of our men were ever destined to eat   major hooker came in shortly after with a good store of provisions  but  in no very good case  for he had had a skirmish with the dragoons  and  had lost eight or ten of his men  he bore a complaint straightway to the  council concerning the manner in which we had deserted him  but great  events were coming fast upon us now  and there was small time to inquire  into petty matters of discipline  for myself  i freely confess  looking  back on it  that as a soldier he was entirely in the right  and that  from a strict military point of view our conduct was not to be excused   yet i trust  my dears  even now  when years have weighed me down  that  the scream of a woman in distress would be a signal which would draw me  to her aid while these old limbs could bear me  for the duty which  we owe to the weak overrides all other duties and is superior to all  circumstances  and i for one cannot see why the coat of the soldier  should harden the heart of the man         chapter xxxi  of the maid of the marsh and the bubble which rose from  the bog    all bridgewater was in a ferment as we rode in  for king james s forces  were within four miles  on the sedgemoor plain  and it was likely that  they would push on at once and storm the town  some rude works had been  thrown up on the eastover side  behind which two brigades were drawn  up in arms  while the rest of the army was held in reserve in the  market place and castle field  towards afternoon  however  parties of  our horse and peasants from the fen country came in with the news that  there was no fear of an assault being attempted  the royal troops had  quartered themselves snugly in the little villages of the neighbourhood   and having levied contributions of cider and of beer from the farmers   they showed no sign of any wish to advance     the town was full of women  the wives  mothers  and sisters of our  peasants  who had come in from far and near to see their loved ones once  more  fleet street or cheapside upon a busy day are not more crowded  than were the narrow streets and lanes of the somersetshire town   jack booted  buff coated troopers  scarlet militiamen  brown   stern faced tauntonians  serge clad pikemen  wild  ragged miners   smockfrocked yokels  reckless  weather tanned seamen  gaunt cragsmen  from the northern coast  all pushed and jostled each other in a thick   many coloured crowd  everywhere among them were the country women   straw bonneted and loud tongued  weeping  embracing  and exhorting   here and there amid the motley dresses and gleam of arms moved the dark   sombre figure of a puritan minister  with sweeping sad coloured mantle  and penthouse hat  scattering abroad short fiery ejaculations and stern  pithy texts of the old fighting order  which warmed the men s blood like  liquor  ever and anon a sharp  fierce shout would rise from the people   like the yelp of a high spirited hound which is straining at its leash  and hot to be at the throat of its enemy     our regiment had been taken off duty whenever it was clear that  feversham did not mean to advance  and they were now busy upon the  victuals which our night foray had furnished  it was a sunday  fresh and  warm  with a clear  unclouded sky  and a gentle breeze  sweet with the  smack of the country  all day the bells of the neighbouring villages  rang out their alarm  pealing their music over the sunlit countryside   the upper windows and red tiled roofs of the houses were crowded with  pale faced women and children  who peered out to eastward  where the  splotches of crimson upon the dun coloured moor marked the position of  our enemies     at four o clock monmouth held a last council of war upon the square  tower out of which springs the steeple of bridgewater parish church   whence a good view can be obtained of all the country round  since my  ride to beaufort i had always been honoured with a summons to attend  in  spite of my humble rank in the army  there were some thirty councillors  in all  as many as the space would hold  soldiers and courtiers   cavaliers and puritans  all drawn together now by the bond of a common  danger  indeed  the near approach of a crisis in their fortunes had  broken down much of the distinction of manner which had served to  separate them  the sectary had lost something of his austerity and  become flushed and eager at the prospect of battle  while the giddy man  of fashion was hushed into unwonted gravity as he considered the danger  of his position  their old feuds were forgotten as they gathered on the  parapet and gazed with set faces at the thick columns of smoke which  rose along the sky line     king monmouth stood among his chiefs  pale and haggard  with the  dishevelled  unkempt look of a man whose distress of mind has made him  forgetful of the care of his person  he held a pair of ivory glasses   and as he raised them to his eyes his thin white hands shook and  twitched until it was grievous to watch him  lord grey handed his own  glasses to saxon  who leaned his elbows upon the rough stone breastwork  and stared long and earnestly at the enemy      they are the very men i have myself led   said monmouth at last  in a  low voice  as though uttering his thoughts aloud   over yonder at the  right i see dumbarton s foot  i know these men well  they will fight   had we them with us all would be well       nay  your majesty   lord grey answered with spirit   you do your brave  followers an injustice  they  too  will fight to the last drop of their  blood in your quarrel       look down at them   said monmouth sadly  pointing at the swarming  streets beneath us   braver hearts never beat in english breasts  yet do  but mark how they brabble and clamour like clowns on a saturday night   compare them with the stern  orderly array of the trained battalions   alas  that i should have dragged these honest souls from their little  homes to fight so hopeless a battle       hark at that   cried wade   they do not think it hopeless  nor do we    as he spoke a wild shout rose from the dense crowd beneath  who were  listening to a preacher who was holding forth from a window      it is worthy doctor ferguson   said sir stephen timewell  who had  just come up   he is as one inspired  powerfully borne onwards in his  discourse  verily he is even as one of the prophets of old  he has  chosen for his text   the lord god of gods he knoweth and israel he  shall know  if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the  lord  save us not this day        amen  amen   cried several of the puritan soldiers devoutly  while  another hoarse burst of shouting from below  with the clashing of  scythe blades and the clatter of arms  showed how deeply the people were  moved by the burning words of the fanatic      they do indeed seem to be hot for battle   said monmouth  with a more  sprightly look   it may be that one who has commanded regular troops  as  i have done  is prone to lay too much weight upon the difference which  discipline and training make  these brave lads seem high of heart  what  think you of the enemy s dispositions  colonel saxon       by my faith  i think very little of them  your majesty   saxon answered  bluntly   i have seen armies drawn up in array in many different parts  of the world and under many commanders  i have likewise read the section  which treats of the matter in the  de re militari  of petrinus bellus   and in the works of a fleming of repute  yet i have neither seen nor  heard anything which can commend the arrangements which we see before  us       how call you the hamlet on the left  that with the square ivy clad  church tower   asked monmouth  turning to the mayor of bridgewater   a small  anxious faced man  who was evidently far from easy at the  prominence which his office had brought upon him      westonzoyland  your honour  that is  your grace  i mean  your majesty    he stammered   the other  two miles farther off  is middlezoy  and away  to the left  just on the far side of the rhine  is chedzoy       the rhine  sir  what do you mean   asked the king  starting violently   and turning so fiercely upon the timid burgher  that he lost the little  balance of wits which was left to him      why  the rhine  your grace  your majesty   he quavered   the rhine   which  as your majesty s grace cannot but perceive  is what the country  folk call the rhine       it is a name  your majesty  for the deep and broad ditches which drain  off the water from the great morass of sedgemoor   said sir stephen  timewell     monmouth turned white to his very lips  and several of the council  exchanged significant glances  recalling the strange prophetic jingle  which i had been the means of bringing to the camp  the silence was  broken  however  by an old cromwellian major named hollis  who had been  drawing upon paper the position of the villages in which the enemy was  quartered      if it please your majesty  there is something in their order which  recalls to my mind that of the army of the scots upon the occasion  of the battle of dunbar  cromwell lay in dunbar even as we lie in  bridgewater  the ground around  which was boggy and treacherous  was  held by the enemy  there was not a man in the army who would not own  that  had old leslie held his position  we should  as far as human  wisdom could see  have had to betake us to our ships  leave our stores  and ordnance  and so make the best of our way to newcastle  he moved   however  through the blessing of providence  in such a manner that a  quagmire intervened between his right wing and the rest of his army  on  which cromwell fell upon that wing in the early dawn  and dashed it  to pieces  with such effect that the whole army fled  and we had the  execution of them to the very gates of leith  seven thousand scots lost  their lives  but not more than a hundred or so of the honest folk   now  your majesty will see through your glass that a mile of bogland  intervenes between these villages  and that the nearest one  chedzoy  as  i think they call it  might be approached without ourselves entering the  morass  very sure i am that were the lord general with us now he would  counsel us to venture some such attack       it is a bold thing with raw peasants to attack old soldiers   quoth sir  stephen timewell   yet if it is to be done  i know well that there is  not a man born within sound of the bells of st  mary magdalene who will  flinch from it       you say well  sir stephen   said monmouth   at dunbar cromwell had  veterans at his back  and was opposed to troops who had small experience  of war       yet there is much good sense in what major hollis has said   remarked  lord grey   we must either fall on  or be gradually girt round and  starved out  that being so  why not take advantage at once of the chance  which feversham s ignorance or carelessness hath given us  to morrow  if  churchill can prevail over his chief  i have little doubt that we  shall find their camp rearranged  and so have cause to regret our lost  opportunity       their horse lie at westonzoyland   said wade   the sun is so fierce now  that we can scarce see for its glare and the haze which rises up from  the marshes  yet a little while ago i could make out through my glasses  the long lines of horses picketed on the moor beyond the village   behind  in middlezoy  are two thousand militia  while in chedzoy  where  our attack would fall  there are five regiments of regular foot       if we could break those all would be well   cried monmouth   what is  your advice  colonel buyse       my advice is ever the same   the german answered   we are here to  fight  and the sooner we get to work at it the better       and yours  colonel saxon  do you agree with the opinion of your  friend       i think with major hollis  your majesty  that feversham by his  dispositions hath laid himself open to attack  and that we should take  advantage of it forthwith  yet  considering that trained men and a  numerous horse have great advantage by daylight  i should be in favour  of a camisado or night onfall       the same thought was in my mind   said grey   our friends here know  every inch of the ground  and could guide us to chedzoy as surely in the  darkness as in the day       i have heard   said saxon   that much beer and cider  with wine and  strong waters  have found their way into their camp  if this be so  we may give them a rouse while their heads are still buzzing with the  liquor  when they shall scarce know whether it is ourselves or the blue  devils which have come upon them      a general chorus of approval from the whole council showed that the  prospect of at last coming to an engagement was welcome  after the weary  marchings and delays of the last few weeks      has any cavalier anything to say against this plan   asked the king     we all looked from one to the other  but though many faces were doubtful  or desponding  none had a word to say against the night attack  for it  was clear that our action in any case must be hazardous  and this had at  least the merit of promising a better chance of success than any other   yet  my dears  i dare say the boldest of us felt a sinking at the heart  as we looked at our downcast  sad faced leader  and asked ourselves  whether this was a likely man to bring so desperate an enterprise to a  success      if all are agreed   said he   let our word be  soho   and let us come  upon them as soon after midnight as may be  what remains to be settled  as to the order of battle may be left for the meantime  you will now   gentlemen  return to your regiments  and you will remember that be the  upshot of this what it may  whether monmouth be the crowned king of  england or a hunted fugitive  his heart  while it can still beat  will  ever bear in memory the brave friends who stood at his side in the hour  of his trouble      at this simple and kindly speech a flush of devotion  mingled in my  own case at least with a heart whole pity for the poor  weak gentleman   swept over us  we pressed round him with our hands upon the hilts of our  swords  swearing that we would stand by him  though all the world stood  between him and his rights  even the rigid and impassive puritans were  moved to a show of loyalty  while the courtiers  carried away by zeal   drew their rapiers and shouted until the crowd beneath caught the  enthusiasm  and the air was full of the cheering  the light returned  to monmouth s eye and the colour to his cheek as he listened to the  clamour  for a moment at least he looked like the king which he aspired  to be      my thanks to ye  dear friends and subjects   he cried   the issue rests  with the almighty  but what men can do will  i know well  be done by you  this night  if monmouth cannot have all england  six feet of her shall  at least be his  meanwhile  to your regiments  and may god defend the  right       may god defend the right  cried the council solemnly  and separated   leaving the king with grey to make the final dispositions for the  attack      these popinjays of the court are ready enough to wave their rapiers  and shout when there are four good miles between them and the foe    said saxon  as we made our way through the crowd   i fear that they will  scarce be as forward when there is a line of musqueteers to be faced   and a brigade of horse perhaps charging down upon their flank  but here  comes friend lockarby  with news written upon his face       i have a report to make  colonel   said reuben  hurrying breathlessly  up to us   you may remember that i and my company were placed on guard  this day at the eastern gates      saxon nodded      being desirous of seeing all that i could of the enemy  i clambered up  a lofty tree which stands just without the town  from this post  by the  aid of a glass  i was able to make out their lines and camp  whilst i  was gazing i chanced to observe a man slinking along under cover of the  birch trees half way between their lines and the town  watching him  i  found that he was indeed moving in our direction  presently he came so  near that i was able to distinguish who it was  for it was one whom i  know  but instead of entering the town by my gate he walked round under  cover of the peat cuttings  and so made his way doubtless to some other  entrance  he is a man  however  who i have reason to believe has no true  love for the cause  and it is my belief that he hath been to the  royal camp with news of our doings  and hath now come back for further  information       aye   said saxon  raising his eyebrows   and what is the man s name       his name is derrick  one time chief apprentice to master timewell at  taunton  and now an officer in the taunton foot       what  the young springald who had his eye upon pretty mistress ruth   now  out on love  if it is to turn a true man into a traitor  but  methought he was one of the elect  i have heard him hold forth to the  pikemen  how comes it that one of his kidney should lend help to the  prelatist cause       love again   quoth i   this same love is a pretty flower when it grows  unchecked  but a sorry weed if thwarted       he hath an ill feeling towards many in the camp   said reuben   and he  would ruin the army to avenge himself on them  as a rogue might sink  a ship in the hope of drowning one enemy  sir stephen himself hath  incurred his hatred for refusing to force his daughter into accepting  his suit  he has now returned into the camp  and i have reported the  matter to you  that you may judge whether it would not be well to send  a file of pikemen and lay him by the heels lest he play the spy once  more       perhaps it would be best so   saxon answered  full of thought   and yet  no doubt the fellow would have some tale prepared which would outweigh  our mere suspicions  could we not take him in the very act      a thought slipped into my head  i had observed from the tower that there  was a single lonely cottage about a third of the way to the enemy s  camp  standing by the road at a place where there were marshes on either  side  any one journeying that way must pass it  if derrick tried to  carry our plans to feversham he might be cut off at this point by a  party placed to lie in wait for him      most excellent   saxon exclaimed  when i had explained the project   my  learned fleming himself could not have devised a better rusus belli  do  ye convey as many files as ye may think fit to this point  and i shall  see that master derrick is primed up with some fresh news for my lord  feversham       nay  a body of troops marching out would set tongues wagging   said  reuben   why should not micah and i go ourselves       that would indeed be better   saxon answered   but ye must pledge your  words  come what may  to be back at sundown  for your companies must  stand to arms an hour before the advance      we both gladly gave the desired promise  and having learned for certain  that derrick had indeed returned to the camp  saxon undertook to let  drop in his presence some words as to the plans for the night  while we  set off at once for our post  our horses we left behind  and slipping  out through the eastern gate we made our way over bog and moor   concealing ourselves as best we could  until we came out upon the lonely  roadway  and found ourselves in front of the house     it was a plain  whitewashed  thatch roofed cottage  with a small board  above the door  whereon was written a notice that the occupier sold milk  and butter  no smoke reeked up from the chimney  and the shutters of the  window were closed  from which we gathered that the folk who owned it  had fled away from their perilous position  on either side the marsh  extended  reedy and shallow at the edge  but deeper at a distance  with  a bright green scum which covered its treacherous surface  we knocked  at the weather blotched door  but receiving  as we expected  no reply   i presently put my shoulder against it and forced the staple from its  fastenings     there was but a single chamber within  with a straight ladder in the  corner  leading through a square hole in the ceiling to the sleeping  chamber under the roof  three or four chairs and stools were scattered  over the earthen floor  and at the side a deal table with the broad  brown milk basins upon it  green blotches upon the wall and a sinking  in of one side of the cottage showed the effect of its damp  marsh girt  position     to our surprise it had still one inmate within its walls  in the centre  of the room  facing the door as we entered  stood a little bright   golden haired maid  five or six years of age  she was clad in a clean  white smock  with trim leather belt and shining buckle about her waist   two plump little legs with socks and leathern boots peeped out from  under the dress  stoutly planted with right foot in advance as one who  was bent upon holding her ground  her tiny head was thrown back  and her  large blue eyes were full of mingled wonder and defiance  as we entered  the little witch flapped her kerchief at us  and shooed as though we  were two of the intrusive fowl whom she was wont to chevy out of the  house  reuben and i stood on the threshold  uncertain  and awkward  like  a pair of overgrown school lads  looking down at this fairy queen whose  realms we had invaded  in two minds whether to beat a retreat or to  appease her wrath by soft and coaxing words      go  way   she cried  still waving her hands and shaking her kerchief    go  way  granny told me to tell any one that came to go  way       but if they would not go away  little mistress   asked reuben   what  were you to do then       i was to drive them  way   she answered  advancing boldly against us  with many flaps   you bad man   she continued  flashing out at me   you  have broken granny s bolt       nay  i ll mend it again   i answered penitently  and catching up  a stone i soon fastened the injured staple   there  mistress  your  granddam will never tell the difference       ye must go  way all the same   she persisted   this is granny s house   not yours      what were we to do with this resolute little dame of the marshes  that  we should stay in the house was a crying need  for there was no other  cover or shelter among the dreary bogs where we could hide ourselves   yet she was bent upon driving us out with a decision and fearlessness  which might have put monmouth to shame      you sell milk   said reuben   we are tired and thirsty  so we have come  to have a horn of it       nay   she cried  breaking into smiles   will ye pay me just as the folk  pay granny  oh  heart alive  but that will be fine   she skipped up  on to a stool and filled a pair of deep mugs from the basins upon the  table   a penny  please   said she     it was strange to see the little wife hide the coin away in her smock   with pride and joy in her innocent face at this rare stroke of business  which she had done for her absent granny  we bore our milk away to the  window  and having loosed the shutters we seated ourselves so as to have  an outlook down the road      for the lord s sake  drink slow   whispered reuben  under his breath    we must keep on swilling milk or she will want to turn us out       we have paid toll now   i answered   surely she will let us bide       if you have done you must go  way   she said firmly      were ever two men at arms so tyrannised over by a little dolly such as  this   said i  laughing   nay  little one  we shall compound with you by  paying you this shilling  which will buy all your milk  we can stay here  and drink it at our ease       jinny  the cow  is just across the marsh   quoth she   it is nigh  milking time  and i shall fetch her round if ye wish more       now  god forbid   cried reuben   it will end in our having to buy the  cow  where is your granny  little maid       she hath gone into the town   the child answered   there are bad men  with red coats and guns coming to steal and to fight  but granny will  soon make them go  way  granny has gone to set it all right       we are fighting against the men with the red coats  my chuck   said  i   we shall take care of your house with you  and let no one steal  anything       nay  then ye may stay   quoth she  climbing up upon my knee as grave as  a sparrow upon a bough   what a great boy you are       and why not a man   i asked      because you have no beard upon your face  why  granny hath more hair  upon her chin than you  besides  only boys drink milk  men drink cider       then if i am a boy i shall be your sweetheart   said i      nay  indeed   she cried  with a toss of her golden locks   i have no  mind to wed for a while  but giles martin of gommatch is my sweetheart   what a pretty shining tin smock you have  and what a great sword  why  should people have these things to harm each other with when they are in  truth all brothers       why are they all brothers  little mistress   asked reuben      because granny says that they are all the children of the great  father   she answered   if they have all one father they must be  brothers  mustn t they       out of the mouths of babes and sucklings  micah   quoth reuben  staring  out of the window      you are a rare little marsh flower   i said  as she clambered up to  grasp at my steel cap   is it not strange to think  reuben  that there  should be thousands of christian men upon either side of us  athirst  for each other s lives  and here between them is a blue eyed cherub who  lisps out the blessed philosophy which would send us all to our homes  with softened hearts and hale bodies       a day of this child would sicken me for over of soldiering   reuben  answered   the cavalier and the butcher become too near of kin  as i  listen to her       perhaps both are equally needful   said i  shrugging my shoulders   we  have put our hands to the plough  but methinks i see the man for whom we  wait coming down under the shadow of yonder line of pollard willows       it is he  sure enough   cried reuben  peeping through the diamond paned  window      then  little one  you must sit here   said i  raising her up from my  knee and placing her on a chair in a corner   you must be a brave lass  and sit still  whatever may chance  will you do so      she pursed up her rosy lips and nodded her head      he comes on apace  micah   quoth my comrade  who was still standing  by the casement   is he not like some treacherous fox or other beast of  prey      there was indeed something in his lean  black clothed figure and swift  furtive movements which was like some cruel and cunning animal  he stole  along under shadow of the stunted trees and withies  with bent body and  gliding gait  so that from bridgewater it would be no easy matter for  the most keen sighted to see him  indeed  he was so far from the town  that he might safely have come out from his concealment and struck  across the moor  but the deep morass on either side prevented him from  leaving the road until he had passed the cottage     as he came abreast of our ambush we both sprang out from the open door  and barred his way  i have heard the independent minister at emsworth  give an account of satan s appearance  but if the worthy man had been  with us that day  he need not have drawn upon his fancy  the man s dark  face whitened into a sickly and mottled pallor  while he drew back with  a long sharp intaking of the breath and a venomous flash from his black  eyes  glancing swiftly from right to left for some means of escape  for  an instant his hand shot towards his sword hilt  but his reason told him  that he could scarce expect to fight his way past us  then he glanced  round  but any retreat would lead him back to the men whom he had  betrayed  so he stood sullen and stolid  with heavy  downcast face and  shifting  restless eye  the very type and symbol of treachery      we have waited some time for you  master john derrick   said i   you  must now return with us to the town       on what grounds do you arrest me   he asked  in hoarse  broken tones    where is your warranty  who hath given you a commission to molest  travellers upon the king s highway       i have my colonel s commission   i answered shortly   you have been  once already to feversham s camp this morning       it is a lie   he snarled fiercely   i do but take a stroll to enjoy the  air       it is the truth   said reuben   i saw you myself on your return  let us  see that paper which peeps from your doublet       we all know why you should set this trap for me   derrick cried  bitterly   you have set evil reports afloat against me  lest i stand in  your light with the mayor s daughter  what are you that you should dare  to raise your eyes to her  a mere vagrant and masterless man  coming  none know whence  why should you aspire to pluck the flower which has  grown up amongst us  what had you to do with her or with us  answer me       it is not a matter which i shall discuss  save at a more fitting time  and place   reuben answered quietly   do you give over your sword and  come back with us  for my part  i promise to do what i can to save your  life  should we win this night  your poor efforts can do little to harm  us  should we lose  there may be few of us left to harm       i thank you for your kindly protection   he replied  in the same white   cold  bitter manner  unbuckling his sword as he spoke  and walking  slowly up to my companion   you can take this as a gift to mistress  ruth   he said  presenting the weapon in his left hand   and this   he  added  plucking a knife from his belt and burying it in my poor friend s  side     it was done in an instant  so suddenly that i had neither time to spring  between  nor to grasp his intention before the wounded man sank gasping  on the ground  and the knife tinkled upon the pathway at my feet  the  villain set up a shrill cry of triumph  and bounding back in time to  avoid the savage sword thrust which i made at him  he turned and fled  down the road at the top of his speed  he was a far lighter man than i   and more scantily clad  yet i had  from my long wind and length of limb   been the best runner of my district  and he soon learned by the sound of  my feet that he had no chance of shaking me off  twice he doubled as a  hare does when the hound is upon him  and twice my sword passed within a  foot of him  for in very truth i had no more thought of mercy than if  he had been a poisonous snake who had fastened his fangs into my friend  before my eyes  i never dreamed of giving nor did he of claiming it   at last  hearing my steps close upon him and my breathing at his  very shoulder  he sprang wildly through the reeds and dashed into the  treacherous morass  ankle deep  knee deep  thigh deep  waist deep  we  struggled and staggered  i still gaining upon him  until i was within  arm s reach of him  and had whirled up my sword to strike  it had been  ordained  however  my dear children  that he should die not the death of  a man  but that of the reptile which he was  for even as i closed upon  him he sank of a sudden with a gurgling sound  and the green marsh scum  met above his head  no ripple was there and no splash to mark the spot   it was sudden and silent  as though some strange monster of the marshes  had seized him and dragged him down into the depths  as i stood with  upraised sword still gazing upon the spot  one single great bubble rose  and burst upon the surface  and then all was still once more  and the  dreary fens lay stretched before me  the very home of death and of  desolation  i know not whether he had indeed come upon some sudden pit  which had engulfed him  or whether in his despair he had cast himself  down of set purpose  i do but know that there in the great sedgemoor  morass are buried the bones of the traitor and the spy     i made my way as best i could through the oozy clinging mud to the  margin  and hastened back to where reuben was lying  bending over him  i found that the knife had pierced through the side leather which  connected his back and front plates  and that the blood was not only  pouring out of the wound  but was trickling from the corner of his  mouth  with trembling fingers i undid the straps and buckles  loosened  the armour  and pressed my kerchief to his side to staunch the flow      i trust that you have not slain him  micah   he said of a sudden   opening his eyes      a higher power than ours has judged him  reuben   i answered      poor devil  he has had much to embitter him   he murmured  and  straightway fainted again  as i knelt over him  marking the lad s white  face and laboured breathing  and bethought me of his simple  kindly  nature and of the affection which i had done so little to deserve  i am  not ashamed to say  my dears  albeit i am a man somewhat backward in my  emotions  that my tears were mingled with his blood     as it chanced  decimus saxon had found time to ascend the church tower  for the purpose of watching us through his glass and seeing how we  fared  noting that there was something amiss  he had hurried down for  a skilled chirurgeon  whom he brought out to us under an escort of  scythesmen  i was still kneeling by my senseless friend  doing what an  ignorant man might to assist him  when the party arrived and helped me  to bear him into the cottage  out of the glare of the sun  the minutes  were as hours while the man of physic with a grave face examined and  probed the wound      it will scarce prove fatal   he said at last  and i could have embraced  him for the words   the blade has glanced on a rib  though the lung is  slightly torn  we shall hear him back with us to the town       you hear what he says   said saxon kindly   he is a man whose opinion  is of weight                 a skilful leach is better far              than half a hundred men of war      cheer up  man  you are as white as though it were your blood and not his  which was drained away  where is derrick       drowned in the marshes   i answered       tis well  it will save us six feet of good hemp  but our position here  is somewhat exposed  since the royal horse might make a dash at us  who  is this little maid who sits so white and still in the corner        tis the guardian of the house  her granny has left her here       you had better come with us  there may be rough work here ere all is  over       nay  i must wait for granny   she answered  with the tears running down  her cheeks      but how if i take you to granny  little one   said i   we cannot  leave you here   i held out my arms  and the child sprang into them and  nestled up against my bosom  sobbing as though her heart would break    take me away   she cried   i se frightened      i soothed the little trembling thing as best i might  and bore her off  with me upon my shoulder  the scythesmen had passed the handles of their  long weapons through the sleeves of their jerkins in such a way as to  form a couch or litter  upon which poor reuben was laid  a slight dash  of colour had come back to his cheeks in answer to some cordial given  him by the chirurgeon  and he nodded and smiled at saxon  thus  pacing  slowly  we returned to bridgewater  where reuben was carried to our  quarters  and i bore the little maid of the marshes to kind townsfolk   who promised to restore her to her home when the troubles were over         chapter xxxii  of the onfall at sedgemoor    however pressing our own private griefs and needs  we had little time  now to dwell upon them  for the moment was at hand which was to decide  for the time not only our own fates  but that of the protestant cause  in england  none of us made light of the danger  nothing less than a  miracle could preserve us from defeat  and most of us were of opinion  that the days of the miracles were past  others  however  thought  otherwise  i believe that many of our puritans  had they seen the  heavens open that night  and the armies of the seraphim and the cherubim  descending to our aid  would have looked upon it as by no means a  wonderful or unexpected occurrence     the whole town was loud with the preaching  every troop or company had  its own chosen orator  and sometimes more than one  who held forth  and expounded  from barrels  from waggons  from windows  and even from  housetops  they addressed the crowds beneath  nor was their eloquence  in vain  hoarse  fierce shouts rose up from the streets  with broken  prayers and ejaculations  men were drunk with religion as with wine   their faces were flushed  their speech thick  their gestures wild  sir  stephen and saxon smiled at each other as they watched them  for they  knew  as old soldiers  that of all causes which make a man valiant in  deed and careless of life  this religious fit is the strongest and the  most enduring     in the evening i found time to look in upon my wounded friend  and found  him propped up with cushions upon his couch  breathing with some pain   but as bright and merry as ever  our prisoner  major ogilvy  who had  conceived a warm affection for us  sat by his side and read aloud to him  out of an old book of plays      this wound hath come at an evil moment   said reuben impatiently    is it not too much that a little prick like this should send my men  captainless into battle  after all our marching and drilling  i have  been present at the grace  and am cut off from the dinner       your company hath been joined to mine   i answered   though  indeed   the honest fellows are cast down at not having their own captain  has  the physician been to see you       he has left even now   said major ogilvy   he pronounces our friend to  be doing right well  but hath warned me against allowing him to talk       hark to that  lad   said i  shaking my finger at him   if i hear a word  from you i go  you will escape a rough waking this night  major  what  think you of our chance       i have thought little of your chance from the first   he replied  frankly   monmouth is like a ruined gamester  who is now putting his  last piece upon the board  he cannot win much  and he may lose all       nay  that is a hard saying   said i   a success might set the whole of  the midlands in arms       england is not ripe for it   the major answered  with a shake of his  head   it is true that it has no fancy either for papistry or for a  papist king  but we know that it is but a passing evil  since the next  in succession  the prince of orange  is a protestant  why  then  should  we risk so many evils to bring that about which time and patience must   perforce  accomplish between them  besides  the man whom ye support has  shown that he is unworthy of confidence  did he not in his declaration  promise to leave the choice of a monarch to the commons  and yet  in  less than a week  he proclaimed himself at taunton market cross  who  could believe one who has so little regard for truth       treason  major  rank treason   i answered  laughing   yet if we could  order a leader as one does a coat we might  perchance  have chosen  one of a stronger texture  we are in arms not for him  but for the old  liberties and rights of englishmen  have you seen sir gervas      major ogilvy  and even reuben  burst out laughing   you will find him  in the room above   said our prisoner   never did a famous toast prepare  herself for a court ball as he is preparing for his battle  if the  king s troops take him they will assuredly think that they have the  duke  he hath been in here to consult us as to his patches  hosen  and i  know not what beside  you had best go up to him       adieu  then  reuben   i said  grasping his hand in mine      adieu  micah  god shield you from harm   said he      can i speak to you aside  major   i whispered   i think   i went on   as he followed me into the passage   that you will not say that your  captivity hath been made very harsh for you  may i ask  therefore  that  you will keep an eye upon my friend should we be indeed defeated this  night  no doubt if feversham gains the upper hand there will be bloody  work  the hale can look after themselves  but he is helpless  and will  need a friend      the major pressed my hand   i swear to god   he said   that no harm  shall befall him       you have taken a load from my heart   i answered   i know that i leave  him in safety   i can now ride to battle with an easy mind   with a  friendly smile the soldier returned to the sick room  whilst i ascended  the stair and entered the quarters of sir gervas jerome     he was standing before a table which was littered all over with pots   brushes  boxes  and a score of the like trifles  which he had either  bought or borrowed for the occasion  a large hand mirror was balanced  against the wall  with rush lights on either side of it  in front of  this  with a most solemn and serious expression upon his pale  handsome  face  the baronet was arranging and re arranging a white berdash cravat   his riding boots were brightly polished  and the broken seam repaired   his sword sheath  breastplate  and trappings were clear and bright   he wore his gayest and newest suit  and above all he had donned a most  noble and impressive full bottomed periwig  which drooped down to his  shoulders  as white as powder could make it  from his dainty riding hat  to his shining spur there was no speck or stain upon him  a sad set off  to my own state  plastered as i was with a thick crust of the sedgemoor  mud  and disordered from having ridden and worked for two days without  rest or repose      split me  but you have come in good time   he exclaimed  as i entered    i have even now sent down for a flask of canary  ah  and here it  comes   as a maid from the inn tripped upstairs with the bottle and  glasses   here is a gold piece  my pretty dear  the very last that i  have in the whole world  it is the only survivor of a goodly family  pay  mine host for the wine  little one  and keep the change for thyself  to  buy ribbons for the next holiday  now  curse me if i can get this cravat  to fit unwrinkled       there is nought amiss with it   i answered   how can such trifles  occupy you at such a time       trifles   he cried angrily   trifles  well  there  it boots not to  argue with you  your bucolic mind would never rise to the subtle import  which may lie in such matters  the rest of mind which it is to have  them right  and the plaguey uneasiness when aught is wrong  it comes   doubtless  from training  and it may be that i have it more than others  of my class  i feel as a cat who would lick all day to take the least  speck from her fur  is not the patch over the eyebrow happily chosen   nay  you cannot even offer an opinion  i would as soon ask friend marot   the knight of the pistol  fill up your glass       your company awaits you by the church   i remarked   i saw them as i  passed       how looked they   he asked   were they powdered and clean       nay  i had little leisure to observe  i saw that they were cutting  their matches and arranging their priming       i would that they had all snaphances   he answered  sprinkling himself  with scented water   the matchlocks are slow and cumbersome  have you  had wine enough       i will take no more   i answered      then mayhap the major may care to finish it  it is not often i ask help  with a bottle  but i would keep my head cool this night  let us go down  and see to our men      it was ten o clock when we descended into the street  the hubbub of  the preachers and the shouting of the people had died away  for the  regiments had fallen into their places  and stood silent and stern   with the faint light from the lamps and windows playing over their dark  serried ranks  a cool  clear moon shone down upon us from amidst fleecy  clouds  which drifted ever and anon across her face  away in the north  tremulous rays of light flickered up into the heavens  coming and going  like long  quivering fingers  they were the northern lights  a sight  rarely seen in the southland counties  it is little wonder that  coming  at such a time  the fanatics should have pointed to them as signals  from another world  and should have compared them to that pillar of fire  which guided israel through the dangers of the desert  the footpaths and  the windows were crowded with women and children  who broke into shrill  cries of fear or of wonder as the strange light waxed and waned      it is half after ten by st  mary s clock   said saxon  as we rode up to  the regiment   have we nothing to give the men       there is a hogshead of zoyland cider in the yard of yonder inn   said  sir gervas   here  dawson  do you take those gold sleeve links and give  them to mine host in exchange  broach the barrel  and let each man have  his horn full  sink me  if they shall fight with nought but cold water  in them       they will feel the need of it ere morning   said saxon  as a score  of pikemen hastened off to the inn   the marsh air is chilling to the  blood       i feel cold already  and covenant is stamping with it   said i   might  we not  if we have time upon our hands  canter our horses down the  line       of a surety   saxon answered gladly   we could not do better   so  shaking our bridles we rode off  our horses  hoofs striking fire from  the flint paved streets as we passed     behind the horse  in a long line which stretched from the eastover gate   across the bridge  along the high street  up the cornhill  and so past  the church to the pig cross  stood our foot  silent and grim  save when  some woman s voice from the windows called forth a deep  short answer  from the ranks  the fitful light gleamed on scythes blade or gun barrel   and showed up the lines of rugged  hard set faces  some of mere children  with never a hair upon their cheeks  others of old men whose grey beards  swept down to their cross belts  but all bearing the same stamp of a  dogged courage and a fierce self contained resolution  here were still  the fisher folk of the south  here  too  were the fierce men from the  mendips  the wild hunters from porlock quay and minehead  the poachers  of exmoor  the shaggy marshmen of axbridge  the mountain men from the  quantocks  the serge and wool workers of devonshire  the graziers of  bampton  the red coats from the militia  the stout burghers of taunton   and then  as the very bone and sinew of all  the brave smockfrocked  peasants of the plains  who had turned up their jackets to the elbow   and exposed their brown and corded arms  as was their wont when good  work had to be done  as i speak to you  dear children  fifty years  rolls by like a mist in the morning  and i am riding once more down  the winding street  and see again the serried ranks of my gallant  companions  brave hearts  they showed to all time how little training it  takes to turn an englishman into a soldier  and what manner of men are  bred in those quiet  peaceful hamlets which dot the sunny slopes of the  somerset and devon downs  if ever it should be that england should  be struck upon her knees  if those who fight her battles should have  deserted her  and she should find herself unarmed in the presence of her  enemy  let her take heart and remember that every village in the realm  is a barrack  and that her real standing army is the hardy courage and  simple virtue which stand ever in the breast of the humblest of her  peasants     as we rode down the long line a buzz of greeting and welcome rose now  and again from the ranks as they recognised through the gloom saxon s  tall  gaunt figure  the clock was on the stroke of eleven as we returned  to our own men  and at that very moment king monmouth rode out from the  inn where he was quartered  and trotted with his staff down the high  street  all cheering had been forbidden  but waving caps and brandished  arms spoke the ardour of his devoted followers  no bugle was to sound  the march  but as each received the word the one in its rear followed  its movements  the clatter and shuffle of hundreds of moving feet came  nearer and nearer  until the frome men in front of us began to march   and we found ourselves fairly started upon the last journey which many  of us were ever to take in this world     our road lay across the parret  through eastover  and so along the  winding track past the spot where derrick met his fate  and the lonely  cottage of the little maid  at the other side of this the road becomes  a mere pathway over the plain  a dense haze lay over the moor  gathering  thickly in the hollows  and veiling both the town which we had left and  the villages which we were approaching  now and again it would lift  for a few moments  and then i could see in the moonlight the long black  writhing line of the army  with the shimmer of steel playing over it   and the rude white standards flapping in the night breeze  far on the  right a great fire was blazing  some farmhouse  doubtless  which the  tangiers devils had made spoil of  very slow our march was  and very  careful  for the plain was  as sir stephen timewell had told us  cut  across by great ditches or rhines  which could not be passed save at  some few places  these ditches were cut for the purpose of draining the  marshes  and were many feet deep of water and of mud  so that even  the horse could not cross them  the bridges were narrow  and some time  passed before the army could get over  at last  however  the two main  ones  the black ditch and the langmoor rhine  were safely traversed and  a halt was called while the foot was formed in line  for we had reason  to believe that no other force lay between the royal camp and ourselves   so far our enterprise had succeeded admirably  we were within half a  mile of the camp without mistake or accident  and none of the enemy s  scouts had shown sign of their presence  clearly they held us in such  contempt that it had never occurred to them that we might open the  attack  if ever a general deserved a beating it was feversham that  night  as he drew up upon the moor the clock of chedzoy struck one      is it not glorious   whispered sir gervas  as we reined up upon the  further side of the langmoor rhine   what is there on earth to compare  with the excitement of this       you speak as though it wore a cocking match or a bull baiting   i  answered  with some little coldness   it is a solemn and a sad occasion   win who will  english blood must soak the soil of england this night       the more room for those who are left   said he lightly   mark over  yonder the glow of their camp fires amidst the fog  what was it that  your seaman friend did recommend  get the weather gauge of them and  board  eh  have you told that to the colonel       nay  this is no time for quips and cranks   i answered gravely   the  chances are that few of us will ever see to morrow s sun rise       i have no great curiosity to see it   he remarked  with a laugh   it  will be much as yesterday s  zounds  though i have never risen to see  one in my life  i have looked on many a hundred ere i went to bed       i have told friend reuben such few things as i should desire to be done  in case i should fall   said i   it has eased my mind much to know that  i leave behind some word of farewell  and little remembrance to all whom  i have known  is there no service of the sort which i can do for you       hum   said he  musing   if i go under  you can tell araminta  nay  let  the poor wench alone  why should i send her messages which may plague  her  should you be in town  little tommy chichester would be glad to  hear of the fun which we have had in somerset  you will find him at the  coca tree every day of the week between two and four of the clock  there  is mother butterworth  too  whom i might commend to your notice  she  was the queen of wet nurses  but alas  cruel time hath dried up her  business  and she hath need of some little nursing herself       if i live and you should fall  i shall do what may be done for her    said i   have you aught else to say       only that hacker of paul s yard is the best for vests   he answered    it is a small piece of knowledge  yet like most other knowledge it hath  been bought and paid for  one other thing  i have a trinket or two left  which might serve as a gift for the pretty puritan maid  should our  friend lead her to the altar  od s my life  but she will make him read  some queer books  how now  colonel  why are we stuck out on the moor  like a row of herons among the sedges       they are ordering the line for the attack   said saxon  who had ridden  up during our conversation   donnerblitz  who ever saw a camp so  exposed to an onfall  oh for twelve hundred good horse  for an hour of  wessenburg s pandours  would i not trample them down until their camp  was like a field of young corn after a hail storm       may not our horse advance   i asked     the old soldier gave a deep snort of disdain   if this fight is to be  won it must be by our foot   said he   what can we hope for from such  cavalry  keep your men well in hand  for we may have to bear the brunt  of the king s dragoons  a flank attack would fall upon us  for we are in  the post of honour       there are troops to the right of us   i answered  peering through the  darkness      aye  the taunton burghers and the frome peasants  our brigade covers  the right flank  next us are the mendip miners  nor could i wish for  better comrades  if their zeal do not outrun their discretion  they are  on their knees in the mud at this moment       they will fight none the worse for that   i remarked   but surely the  troops are advancing       aye  aye   cried saxon joyously  plucking out his sword  and tying  his handkerchief round the handle to strengthen his grip   the hour has  come  forwards      very slowly and silently we crept on through the dense fog  our feet  splashing and slipping in the sodden soil  with all the care which  we could take  the advance of so great a number of men could not be  conducted without a deep sonorous sound from the thousands of marching  feet  ahead of us were splotches of ruddy light twinkling through the  fog which marked the royal watch fires  immediately in front in a dense  column our own horse moved forwards  of a sudden out of the darkness  there came a sharp challenge and a shout  with the discharge of a  carbine and the sound of galloping hoofs  away down the line we heard  a ripple of shots  the first line of outposts had been reached  at the  alarm our horse charged forward with a huzza  and we followed them as  fast as our men could run  we had crossed two or three hundred yards of  moor  and could hear the blowing of the royal bugles quite close to us   when our horse came to a sudden halt  and our whole advance was at a  standstill      sancta maria   cried saxon  dashing forward with the rest of us to find  out the cause of the delay   we must on at any cost  a halt now will  ruin our camisado       forwards  forwards   cried sir gervas and i  waving our swords      it is no use  gentlemen   cried a cornet of horse  wringing his hands    we are undone and betrayed  there is a broad ditch without a ford in  front of us  full twenty feet across       give me room for my horse  and i shall show ye the way across   cried  the baronet  backing his steed   now  lads  who s for a jump       nay  sir  for god s sake   said a trooper  laying his hand upon his  bridle   sergeant sexton hath sprung in even now  and horse and man have  gone to the bottom       let us see it  then   cried saxon  pushing his way through the crowd  of horsemen  we followed close at his heels  until we found ourselves on  the borders of the vast trench which impeded our advance     to this day i have never been able to make up my mind whether it was  by chance or by treachery on the part of our guides that this fosse was  overlooked until we stumbled upon it in the dark  there are some who say  that the bussex rhine  as it is called  is not either deep or broad   and was  therefore  unmentioned by the moorsmen  but that the recent  constant rains had swollen it to an extent never before known  others  say that the guides had been deceived by the fog  and taken a wrong  course  whereas  had we followed another track  we might have been able  to come upon the camp without crossing the ditch  however that may be   it is certain that we found it stretching in front of us  broad  black   and forbidding  full twenty feet from bank to bank  with the cap of the  ill fated sergeant just visible in the centre as a mute warning to all  who might attempt to ford it      there must be a passage somewhere   cried saxon furiously   every  moment is worth a troop of horse to them  where is my lord grey  hath  the guide met with his deserts       major hollis hath hurled the guide into the ditch   the young cornet  answered   my lord grey hath ridden along the bank seeking for a ford      i caught a pike out of a footman s hand  and probed into the black  oozy mud  standing myself up to the waist in it  and holding covenant s  bridle in my left hand  nowhere could i touch bottom or find any hope of  solid foothold      here  fellow   cried saxon  seizing a trooper by the arm   make for  the rear  gallop as though the devil were behind you  bring up a pair  of ammunition waggons  and we shall see whether we cannot bridge this  infernal puddle       if a few of us could make a lodgment upon the other side we might make  it good until help came   said sir gervas  as the horseman galloped off  upon his mission     all down the rebel line a fierce low roar of disappointment and rage  showed that the whole army had met the same obstacle which hindered  our attack  on the other side of the ditch the drums beat  the bugles  screamed  and the shouts and oaths of the officers could be heard as  they marshalled their men  glancing lights in chedzoy  westonzoyland   and the other hamlets to left and right  showed how fast the alarm  was extending  decimus saxon rode up and down the edge of the fosse   pattering forth foreign oaths  grinding his teeth in his fury  and  rising now and again in his stirrups to shake his gauntleted hands at  the enemy      for whom are ye   shouted a hoarse voice out of the haze      for the king   roared the peasants in answer      for which king   cried the voice      for king monmouth       let them have it  lads   and instantly a storm of musket bullets  whistled and sung about our ears  as the sheet of flame sprang out of  the darkness the maddened  half broken horses dashed wildly away across  the plain  resisting the efforts of the riders to pull them up  there  are some  indeed  who say that those efforts were not very strong  and  that our troopers  disheartened at the check at the ditch  were not  sorry to show their heels to the enemy  as to my lord grey  i can say  truly that i saw him in the dim light among the flying squadrons  doing  all that a brave cavalier could do to bring them to a stand  away they  went  however  thundering through the ranks of the foot and out over the  moor  leaving their companions to bear the whole brunt of the battle      on to your faces  men   shouted saxon  in a voice which rose high above  the crash of the musketry and the cries of the wounded  the pikemen and  scythesmen threw themselves down at his command  while the musqueteers  knelt in front of them  loading and firing  with nothing to aim at save  the burning matches of the enemy s pieces  which could be seen twinkling  through the darkness  all along  both to the right and the left  a  rolling fire had broken out  coming in short  quick volleys from the  soldiers  and in a continuous confused rattle from the peasants  on the  further wing our four guns had been brought into play  and we could hear  their dull growling in the distance      sing  brothers  sing   cried our stout hearted chaplain  master joshua  pettigrue  bustling backwards and forwards among the prostrate ranks    let us call upon the lord in our day of trial   the men raised a loud  hymn of praise  which swelled into a great chorus as it was taken up by  the taunton burghers upon our right and the miners upon our left  at  the sound the soldiers on the other side raised a fierce huzza  and the  whole air was full of clamour     our musqueteers had been brought to the very edge of the bussex rhine   and the royal troops had also advanced as far as they were able  so that  there were not five pikes  lengths between the lines  yet that short  distance was so impassable that  save for the more deadly fire  a  quarter of a mile might have divided us  so near were we that the  burning wads from the enemy s muskets flew in flakes of fire over  our heads  and we felt upon our faces the hot  quick flush of their  discharges  yet though the air was alive with bullets  the aim of the  soldiers was too high for our kneeling ranks  and very few of the men  were struck  for our part  we did what we could to keep the barrels of  our muskets from inclining upwards  saxon  sir gervas  and i walked  our horses up and down without ceasing  pushing them level with our  sword blades  and calling on the men to aim steadily and slowly  the  groans and cries from the other side of the ditch showed that some  at  least  of our bullets had not been fired in vain      we hold our own in this quarter   said i to saxon   it seems to me that  their fire slackens       it is their horse that i fear   he answered   they can avoid the ditch   since they come from the hamlets on the flank  they may be upon us at  any time       hullo  sir   shouted sir gervas  reining up his steed upon the very  brink of the ditch  and raising his cap in salute to a mounted officer  upon the other side   can you tell me if we have the honour to be  opposed to the foot guards       we are dumbarton s regiment  sir   cried the other   we shall give ye  good cause to remember having met us       we shall be across presently to make your further acquaintance   sir  gervas answered  and at the same moment rolled  horse and all  into the  ditch  amid a roar of exultation from the soldiers  half a dozen of his  musqueteers sprang instantly  waist deep  into the mud  and dragged our  friend out of danger  but the charger  which had been shot through the  heart  sank without a struggle      there is no harm   cried the baronet  springing to his feet   i would  rather fight on foot like my brave musqueteers   the men broke out  a cheering at his words  and the fire on both sides became hotter  than ever  it was a marvel to me  and to many more  to see these brave  peasants with their mouths full of bullets  loading  priming  and firing  as steadily as though they had been at it all their lives  and holding  their own against a veteran regiment which has proved itself in other  fields to be second to none in the army of england     the grey light of morning was stealing over the moor  and still the  fight was undecided  the fog hung about us in feathery streaks  and  the smoke from our guns drifted across in a dun coloured cloud  through  which the long lines of red coats upon the other side of the rhine  loomed up like a battalion of giants  my eyes ached and my lips prinkled  with the smack of the powder  on every side of me men were falling fast   for the increased light had improved the aim of the soldiers  our good  chaplain  in the very midst of a psalm  had uttered a great shout  of praise and thanksgiving  and so passed on to join those of his  parishioners who were scattered round him upon the moor  hope above  williams and keeper milson  under officers  and among the stoutest  men in the company  were both down  the one dead and the other sorely  wounded  but still ramming down charges  and spitting bullets into his  gun barrel  the two stukeleys of somerton  twins  and lads of great  promise  lay silently with grey faces turned to the grey sky  united in  death as they had been in birth  everywhere the dead lay thick amid the  living  yet no man flinched from his place  and saxon still walked  his horse among them with words of hope and praise  while his stern   deep lined face and tall sinewy figure were a very beacon of hope to  the simple rustics  such of my scythesmen as could handle a musket were  thrown forward into the fighting line  and furnished with the arms and  pouches of those who had fallen     ever and anon as the light waxed i could note through the rifts in the  smoke and the fog how the fight was progressing in other parts of the  field  on the right the heath was brown with the taunton and frome  men  who  like ourselves  were lying down to avoid the fire  along the  borders of the bussex rhine a deep fringe of their musqueteers were  exchanging murderous volleys  almost muzzle to muzzle  with the  left wing of the same regiment with which we were engaged  which was  supported by a second regiment in broad white facings  which i believe  to have belonged to the wiltshire militia  on either bank of the black  trench a thick line of dead  brown on the one side  and scarlet on the  other  served as a screen to their companions  who sheltered themselves  behind them and rested their musket barrels upon their prostrate bodies   to the left amongst the withies lay five hundred mendip and bagworthy  miners  singing lustily  but so ill armed that they had scarce one gun  among ten wherewith to reply to the fire which was poured into them   they could not advance  and they would not retreat  so they sheltered  themselves as best they might  and waited patiently until their leaders  might decide what was to be done  further down for half a mile or more  the long rolling cloud of smoke  with petulant flashes of flame spurting  out through it  showed that every one of our raw regiments was bearing  its part manfully  the cannon on the left had ceased firing  the dutch  gunners had left the islanders to settle their own quarrels  and were  scampering back to bridgewater  leaving their silent pieces to the royal  horse     the battle was in this state when there rose a cry of  the king  the  king   and monmouth rode through our ranks  bare headed and wild eyed   with buyse  wade  and a dozen more beside him  they pulled up within a  spear s length of me  and saxon  spurring forward to meet them  raised  his sword to the salute  i could not but mark the contrast between  the calm  grave face of the veteran  composed yet alert  and the half  frantic bearing of the man whom we were compelled to look upon as our  leader      how think ye  colonel saxon   he cried wildly   how goes the fight  is  all well with ye  what an error  alas  what an error  shall we draw off   eh  how say you       we hold our own here  your majesty   saxon answered   methinks had we  something after the nature of palisados or stockados  after the swedish  fashion  we might even make it good against the horse       ah  the horse   cried the unhappy monmouth   if we get over this  my  lord grey shall answer for it  they ran like a flock of sheep  what  leader could do anything with such troops  oh  lack a day  lack a day   shall we not advance       there is no reason to advance  your majesty  now that the surprise has  failed   said saxon   i had sent for carts to bridge over the trench   according to the plan which is commended in the treatise   de vallis et  fossis   but they are useless now  we can but fight it out as we are       to throw troops across would be to sacrifice them   said wade   we have  lost heavily  colonel saxon  but i think from the look of yonder bank  that ye have given a good account of the red coats       stand firm  for god s sake  stand firm   cried monmouth distractedly    the horse have fled  and the cannoniers also  oh  what can i do with  such men  what shall i do  alas  alas   he set spurs to his horse and  galloped off down the line  still ringing his hands and uttering his  dismal wailings  oh  my children  how small  how very small a thing is  death when weighed in the balance with dishonour  had this man but borne  his fate silently  as did the meanest footman who followed his banners   how proud and glad would we have been to have discoursed of him  our  princely leader  but let him rest  the fears and agitations and petty  fond emotions  which showed upon him as the breeze shows upon the water   are all stilled now for many a long year  let us think of the kind heart  and forget the feeble spirit     as his escort trooped after him  the great german man at arms separated  from them and turned back to us   i am weary of trotting up and down  like a lust ritter at a fair   said he   if i bide with ye i am like to  have my share of any fighting which is going  so  steady  mein liebchen   that ball grazed her tail  but she is too old a soldier to wince at  trifles  hullo  friend  where is your horse       at the bottom of the ditch   said sir gervas  scraping the mud off his  dress with his sword blade    tis now half past two   he continued    and we have been at this child s play for an hour and more  with a line  regiment  too  it is not what i had looked forward to       you shall have something to console you anon   cried the german  with  his eyes shining   mein gott  is it not splendid  look to it  friend  saxon  look to it      it was no light matter which had so roused the soldier s admiration  out  of the haze which still lay thick upon our right there twinkled here and  there a bright gleam of silvery light  while a dull  thundering noise  broke upon our ears like that of the surf upon a rocky shore  more and  more frequent came the fitful flashes of steel  louder and yet louder  grew the hoarse gathering tumult  until of a sudden the fog was rent   and the long lines of the royal cavalry broke out from it  wave after  wave  rich in scarlet and blue and gold  as grand a sight as ever the  eye rested upon  there was something in the smooth  steady sweep of so  great a body of horsemen which gave the feeling of irresistible power   rank after rank  and line after line  with waving standards  tossing  manes  and gleaming steel  they poured onwards  an army in themselves   with either flank still shrouded in the mist  as they thundered along   knee to knee and bridle to bridle  there came from them such a gust of  deep chested oaths with the jangle of harness  the clash of steel  and  the measured beat of multitudinous hoofs  that no man who hath not stood  up against such a whirlwind  with nothing but a seven foot pike in his  hand  can know how hard it is to face it with a steady lip and a firm  grip     but wonderful as was the sight  there was  as ye may guess  my  dears  little time for us to gaze upon it  saxon and the german flung  themselves among the pikemen and did all that men could do to thicken  their array  sir gervas and i did the same with the scythesmen  who had  been trained to form a triple front after the german fashion  one rank  kneeling  one stooping  and one standing erect  with weapons advanced   close to us the taunton men had hardened into a dark sullen ring   bristling with steel  in the centre of which might be seen and heard  their venerable mayor  his long beard fluttering in the breeze  and his  strident voice clanging over the field  louder and louder grew the roar  of the horse   steady  my brave lads   cried saxon  in trumpet tones    dig the pike butt into the earth  best it on the right foot  give not  an inch  steady   a great shout went up from either side  and then the  living wave broke over us     what hope is there to describe such a scene as that  the crashing of  wood  the sharp gasping cries  the snorting of horses  the jar when the  push of pike met with the sweep of sword  who can hope to make  another see that of which he himself carries away so vague and dim an  impression  one who has acted in such a scene gathers no general sense  of the whole combat  such as might be gained by a mere onlooker  but  he has stamped for ever upon his mind just the few incidents which may  chance to occur before his own eyes  thus my memories are confined to a  swirl of smoke with steel caps and fierce  eager faces breaking through  it  with the red gaping nostrils of horses and their pawing fore feet  as they recoiled from the hedge of steel  i see  too  a young beardless  lad  an officer of dragoons  crawling on hands and knees under the  scythes  and i hear his groan as one of the peasants pinned him to the  ground  i see a bearded  broad faced trooper riding a grey horse just  outside the fringe of the scythes  seeking for some entrance  and  screaming the while with rage  small things imprint themselves upon a  man s notice at such a time  i even marked the man s strong white teeth  and pink gums  at the same time i see a white faced  thin lipped man  leaning far forward over his horse s neck and driving at me with his  sword point  cursing the while as only a dragoon can curse  all these  images start up as i think of that fierce rally  during which i hacked  and cut and thrust at man and horse without a thought of parry or  of guard  all round rose a fierce babel of shouts and cries  godly  ejaculations from the peasants and oaths from the horsemen  with saxon s  voice above all imploring his pikemen to stand firm  then the cloud  of horse men recoiled  circling off over the plain  and the shout of  triumph from my comrades  and an open snuff box thrust out in front of  me  proclaimed that we had seen the back of as stout a squadron as ever  followed a kettledrum     but if we could claim it as a victory  the army in general could scarce  say as much  none but the very pick of the troops could stand against  the flood of heavy horses and steel clad men  the frome peasants were  gone  swept utterly from the field  many had been driven by pure weight  and pressure into the fatal mud which had checked our advance  many  others  sorely cut and slashed  lay in ghastly heaps all over the ground  which they had held  a few by joining our ranks had saved themselves  from the fate of their companions  further off the men of taunton still  stood fast  though in sadly diminished numbers  a long ridge of horses  and cavaliers in front of them showed how stern had been the attack and  how fierce the resistance  on our left the wild miners had been broken  at the first rush  but had fought so savagely  throwing themselves upon  the ground and stabbing upwards at the stomachs of the horses  that they  had at last beaten off the dragoons  the devonshire militiamen  however   had been scattered  and shared the fate of the men of frome  during the  whole of the struggle the foot upon the further bank of the bussex rhine  were pouring in a hail of bullets  which our musqueteers  having to  defend themselves against the horse  were unable to reply to     it needed no great amount of soldierly experience to see that the battle  was lost  and that monmouth s cause was doomed  it was broad daylight  now  though the sun had not yet risen  our cavalry was gone  our  ordnance was silent  our line was pierced in many places  and more than  one of our regiments had been destroyed  on the right flank the horse  guards blue  the tangiers horse  and two dragoon regiments were forming  up for a fresh attack  on the left the foot guards had bridged the ditch  and were fighting hand to hand with the men from north somerset  in  front a steady fire was being poured into us  to which our reply was  feeble and uncertain  for the powder carts had gone astray in the dark   and many were calling hoarsely for ammunition  while others were loading  with pebbles instead of ball  add to this that the regiments which still  held their ground had all been badly shaken by the charge  and had lost  a third of their number  yet the brave clowns sent up cheer after cheer   and shouted words of encouragement and homely jests to each other   as though a battle were but some rough game which must as a matter of  course be played out while there was a player left to join in it      is captain clarke there   cried decimus saxon  riding up with his  sword arm flecked with blood   ride over to sir stephen timewell and  tell him to join his men to ours  apart we shall be broken  together we  may stand another charge      setting spurs to covenant i rode over to our companions and delivered  the message  sir stephen  who had been struck by a petronel bullet   and wore a crimsoned kerchief bound round his snow white head  saw  the wisdom of the advice  and moved his townsmen as directed  his  musqueteers being better provided with powder than ours did good service  by keeping down for a time the deadly fire from across the fosse      who would have thought it of him   cried sir stephen  with flashing  eyes  as buyse and saxon rode out to meet him   what think ye now of our  noble monarch  our champion of the protestant cause       he is no very great krieger   said buyse   yet perhaps it may be from  want of habit as much as from want of courage       courage   cried the old mayor  in a voice of scorn   look over yonder  and behold your king   he pointed out over the moor with a finger  which shook as much from anger as from age  there  far away  showing  up against the dark peat coloured soil  rode a gaily dressed cavalier   followed by a knot of attendants  galloping as fast as his horse would  carry him from the field of battle  there was no mistaking the fugitive   it was the recreant monmouth      hush   cried saxon  as we all gave a cry of horror and execration    do not dishearten our brave lads  cowardice is catching and will run  through an army like the putrid fever       der feigherzige   cried buyse  grinding his teeth   and the brave  country folk  it is too much       stand to your pikes  men   roared saxon  in a voice of thunder  and  we had scarce time to form our square and throw ourselves inside of it   before the whirlwind of horse was upon us once more  when the taunton  men had joined us a weak spot had been left in our ranks  and through  this in an instant the blue guards smashed their way  pouring through  the opening  and cutting fiercely to right and left  the burghers on the  one side and our own men on the other replied by savage stabs from their  pikes and scythes  which emptied many a saddle  but while the struggle  was at its hottest the king s cannon opened for the first time with a  deafening roar upon the other side of the rhine  and a storm of balls  ploughed their way through our dense ranks  leaving furrows of dead  and wounded behind them  at the same moment a great cry of  powder  for  christ s sake  powder   arose from the musqueteers whose last charge had  been fired  again the cannon roared  and again our men were mowed down  as though death himself with his scythe were amongst us  at last our  ranks were breaking  in the very centre of the pikemen steel caps were  gleaming  and broadswords rising and falling  the whole body was swept  back two hundred paces or more  struggling furiously the while  and  was there mixed with other like bodies which had been dashed out of all  semblance of military order  and yet refused to fly  men of devon  of  dorset  of wiltshire  and of somerset  trodden down by horse  slashed by  dragoons  dropping by scores under the rain of bullets  still fought on  with a dogged  desperate courage for a ruined cause and a man who  had deserted them  everywhere as i glanced around me were set faces   clenched teeth  yells of rage and defiance  but never a sound of fear  or of submission  some clambered up upon the cruppers of the riders and  dragged them backwards from their saddles  others lay upon their faces  and hamstrung the chargers with their scythe blades  stabbing the  horsemen before they could disengage themselves  again and again the  guards crashed through them from side to side  and yet the shattered  ranks closed up behind them and continued the long drawn struggle  so  hopeless was it and so pitiable that i could have found it in my heart  to wish that they would break and fly  were it not that on the broad  moor there was no refuge which they could make for  and all this time   while they struggled and fought  blackened with powder and parched with  thirst  spilling their blood as though it were water  the man who called  himself their king was spurring over the countryside with a loose rein  and a quaking heart  his thoughts centred upon saving his own neck  come  what might to his gallant followers     large numbers of the foot fought to the death  neither giving nor  receiving quarter  but at last  scattered  broken  and without  ammunition  the main body of the peasants dispersed and fled across the  moor  closely followed by the horse  saxon  buyse  and i had done all  that we could to rally them once more  and had cut down some of the  foremost of the pursuers  when my eye fell suddenly upon sir gervas   standing hatless with a few of his musqueteers in the midst of a swarm  of dragoons  spurring our horses we cut a way to his rescue  and laid  our swords about us until we had cleared off his assailants for the  moment      jump up behind me   i cried   we can make good our escape      he looked up smiling and shook his head   i stay with my company   said  he      your company   saxon cried   why  man  you are mad  your company is cut  off to the last man       that s what i mean   he answered  flicking some dirt from his cravat    don t ye mind  look out for yourselves  goodbye  clarke  present my  compliments to    the dragoons charged down upon us again  we were all  borne backwards  fighting desperately  and when we could look round the  baronet was gone for ever  we heard afterwards that the king s troops  found upon the field a body which they mistook for that of monmouth  on  account of the effeminate grace of the features and the richness of the  attire  no doubt it was that of our undaunted friend  sir gervas jerome   a name which shall ever be dear to my heart  when  ten years afterwards   we heard much of the gallantry of the young courtiers of the household  of the french king  and of the sprightly courage with which they fought  against us in the lowlands at steinkirk and elsewhere  i have always  thought  from my recollection of sir gervas  that i knew what manner of  men they were     and now it was every man for himself  in no part of the field did  the insurgents continue to resist  the first rays of the sun shining  slantwise across the great dreary plain lit up the long line of the  scarlet battalions  and glittered upon the cruel swords which rose and  fell among the struggling drove of resistless fugitives  the german had  become separated from us in the tumult  and we knew not whether he lived  or was slain  though long afterwards we learned that he made good his  escape  only to be captured with the ill fated duke of monmouth  grey   wade  ferguson  and others had contrived also to save themselves  while  stephen timewell lay in the midst of a stern ring of his hard faced  burghers  dying as he had lived  a gallant puritan englishman  all this  we learned afterwards  at present we rode for our lives across the moor   followed by a few scattered bodies of horse  who soon abandoned their  pursuit in order to fasten upon some more easy prey     we were passing a small clump of alder bushes when a loud manly voice  raised in prayer attracted our attention  pushing aside the branches  we  came upon a man  seated with his back up against a great stone  cutting  at his own arm with a broad bladed knife  and giving forth the lord s  prayer the while  without a pause or a quiver in his tone  as he glanced  up from his terrible task we both recognised him as one hollis  whom i  have mentioned as having been with cromwell at dunbar  his arm had  been half severed by a cannon ball  and he was quietly completing the  separation in order to free himself from the dangling and useless limb   even saxon  used as he was to all the forms and incidents of war  stared  open eyed and aghast at this strange surgery  but the man  with a short  nod of recognition  went grimly forward with his task  until  even as  we gazed  he separated the last shred which held it  and lay over with  blanched lips which still murmured the prayer      we could do little  to help him  and  indeed  might by our halt attract his pursuers to his  hiding place  so  throwing him down my flask half filled with water  we  hastened on upon our way  oh  war  my children  what a terrible thing it  is  how are men cozened and cheated by the rare trappings and prancing  steeds  by the empty terms of honour and of glory  until they forget  in the outward tinsel and show the real ghastly horror of the accursed  thing  think not of the dazzling squadrons  nor of the spirit stirring  blare of the trumpets  but think of that lonely man under the shadow of  the alders  and of what he was doing in a christian age and a christian  land  surely i  who have grown grey in harness  and who have seen as  many fields as i have years of my life  should be the last to preach  upon this subject  and yet i can clearly see that  in honesty  men must  either give up war  or else they must confess that the words of the  redeemer are too lofty for them  and that there is no longer any use in  pretending that his teaching can be reduced to practice  i have seen a  christian minister blessing a cannon which had just been founded  and  another blessing a war ship as it glided from the slips  they   the so called representatives of christ  blessed these engines of  destruction which cruel man has devised to destroy and tear his  fellow worms  what would we say if we read in holy writ of our lord  having blessed the battering rams and the catapults of the legions   would we think that it was in agreement with his teaching  but there   as long as the heads of the church wander away so far from the spirit of  its teaching as to live in palaces and drive in carriages  what wonder  if  with such examples before them  the lower clergy overstep at times  the lines laid down by their great master     looking back from the summit of the low hills which lie to the westward  of the moor  we could see the cloud of horse men streaming over the  bridge of the parret and into the town of bridgewater  with the helpless  drove of fugitives still flying in front of them  we had pulled up our  horses  and were looking sadly and silently back at the fatal plain   when the thud of hoofs fell upon our ears  and  turning round  we found  two horsemen in the dress of the guards riding towards us  they had made  a circuit to cut us off  for they were riding straight for us with drawn  swords and eager gestures      more slaughter   i said wearily   why will they force us to it      saxon glanced keenly from beneath his drooping lids at the approaching  horsemen  and a grim smile wreathed his face in a thousand lines and  wrinkles      it is our friend who set the hounds upon our track at salisbury   he  said   this is a happy meeting  i have a score to settle with him      it was  indeed  the hot headed young comet whom we had met at the outset  of our adventures  some evil chance had led him to recognise the tall  figure of my companion as we rode from the field  and to follow him  in  the hope of obtaining revenge for the humiliation which he had met with  at his hands  the other was a lance corporal  a man of square soldierly  build  riding a heavy black horse with a white blaze upon its forehead     saxon rode slowly towards the officer  while the trooper and i fixed our  eyes upon each other      well  boy   i heard my companion say   i trust that you have learned to  fence since we met last      the young guardsman gave a snarl of rage at the taunt  and an instant  afterwards the clink of their sword blades showed that they had met   for my own part i dared not spare a glance upon them  for my opponent  attacked me with such fury that it was all that i could do to keep him  off  no pistol was drawn upon either side  it was an honest contest of  steel against steel  so constant were the corporal s thrusts  now at my  face  now at my body  that i had never an opening for one of the heavy  cuts which might have ended the matter  our horses spun round each  other  biting and pawing  while we thrust and parried  until at last   coming together knee to knee  we found ourselves within sword point  and  grasped each other by the throat  he plucked a dagger from his belt and  struck it into my left arm  but i dealt him a blow with my gauntleted  hand  which smote him off his horse and stretched him speechless upon  the plain  almost at the same moment the cornet dropped from his horse   wounded in several places  saxon sprang from his saddle  and picking the  soldier s dagger from the ground  would have finished them both had i  not jumped down also and restrained him  he flashed round upon me with  so savage a face that i could see that the wild beast nature within him  was fairly roused      what hast thou to do   he snarled   let go       nay  nay  blood enough hath been shed   said i   let them lie       what mercy would they have had upon us   he cried passionately   struggling to get his wrist free   they have lost  and must pay  forfeit       not in cold blood   i said firmly   i shall not abide it       indeed  your lordship   he sneered  with the devil peeping out through  his eyes  with a violent wrench he freed himself from my grasp  and  springing back  picked up the sword which he had dropped      what then   i asked  standing on my guard astride of the wounded man     he stood for a minute or more looking at me from under his heavy hung  brows  with his whole face writhing with passion  every instant i  expected that he would fly at me  but at last  with a gulp in his  throat  he sheathed his rapier with a sharp clang  and sprang back into  the saddle      we part here   he said coldly   i have twice been on the verge of  slaying you  and the third time might be too much for my patience  you  are no fit companion for a cavalier of fortune  join the clergy  lad  it  is your vocation       is this decimus saxon who speaks  or is it will spotterbridge   i  asked  remembering his jest concerning his ancestry  but no answering  smile came upon his rugged face  gathering up his bridle in his left  hand  he shot one last malignant glance at the bleeding officer  and  galloped off along one of the tracks which lead to the southward  i  stood gazing after him  but he never sent so much as a hand wave back   riding on with a rigid neck until he vanished in a dip in the moor      there goes one friend   thought i sadly   and all forsooth because i  will not stand by and see a helpless man s throat cut  another friend is  dead on the field  a third  the oldest and dearest of all  lies wounded  at bridgewater  at the mercy of a brutal soldiery  if i return to my  home i do but bring trouble and danger to those whom i love  whither  shall i turn   for some minutes i stood irresolute beside the prostrate  guardsmen  while covenant strolled slowly along cropping the scanty  herbage  and turning his dark full eyes towards me from time to time  as  though to assure me that one friend at least was steadfast  northward i  looked at the polden hills  southwards  at the blackdowns  westward  at the long blue range of the quantocks  and eastward at the broad fen  country  but nowhere could i see any hope of safety  truth to say  i  felt sick at heart and cared little for the time whether i escaped or  no     a muttered oath followed by a groan roused me from my meditations   the corporal was sitting up rubbing his head with a look of stupid  astonishment upon his face  as though he were not very sure either of  where he was or how he came there  the officer  too  had opened his  eyes and shown other signs of returning consciousness  his wounds were  clearly of no very serious nature  there was no danger of their pursuing  me even should they wish to do so  for their horses had trotted off to  join the numerous other riderless steeds who were wandering all over the  moorlands  i mounted  therefore  and rode slowly away  saving my good  charger as much as possible  for the morning s work had already told  somewhat heavily upon him     there were many scattered bodies of horse riding hither and thither over  the marshes  but i was able to avoid them  and trotted onwards  keeping  to the waste country until i found myself eight or ten miles from the  battlefield  the few cottages and houses which i passed wore deserted   and many of them bore signs of having been plundered  not a peasant was  to be seen  the evil fame of kirke s lambs had chased away all those who  had not actually taken arms  at last  after riding for three hours  i  bethought me that i was far enough from the main line of pursuit to  be free from danger  so i chose out a sheltered spot where a clump of  bushes overhung a little brook  there  seated upon a bank of velvet  moss  i rested my weary limbs  and tried to wash the stains of battle  from my person     it was only now when i could look quietly at my own attire that it was  brought home to me how terrible the encounter must have been in which  i had been engaged  and how wonderful it was that i had come off so  scatheless  of the blows which i had struck in the fight i had faint  remembrance  yet they must have been many and terrible  for my sword  edge was as jagged and turned as though i had hacked for an hour at an  iron bar  from head to foot i was splashed and crimsoned with blood   partly my own  but mostly that of others  my headpiece was dinted with  blows  a petronel bullet had glanced off my front plate  striking it  at an angle  and had left a broad groove across it  two or three other  cracks and stars showed where the good sheet of proof steel had saved  me  my left arm was stiff and well nigh powerless from the corporal s  stab  but on stripping off my doublet and examining the place  i found  that though there had been much bleeding the wound was on the outer side  of the bone  and was therefore of no great import  a kerchief dipped in  water and bound tightly round it eased the smart and stanched the blood   beyond this scratch i had no injuries  though from my own efforts i felt  as stiff and sore all over as though i had been well cudgelled  and the  slight wound got in wells cathedral had reopened and was bleeding  with  a little patience and cold water  however  i was able to dress it and to  tie myself up as well as any chirurgeon in the kingdom     having seen to my injuries i had now to attend to my appearance  for  in truth i might have stood for one of those gory giants with whom the  worthy don bellianis of greece and other stout champions were wont to  contend  no woman or child but would have fled at the sight of me  for  i was as red as the parish butcher when martinmas is nigh  a good wash   however  in the brook soon removed those traces of war  and i was  able to get the marks off my breastplate and boots  in the case of my  clothes  however  it was so hopeless to clean them that i gave it up in  despair  my good old horse had been never so much as grazed by steel or  bullet  so that with a little watering and tending he was soon as fresh  as ever  and we turned our backs on the streamlet a better favoured pair  than we had approached it     it was now going on to mid day  and i began to feel very hungry  for i  had tasted nothing since the evening before  two or three houses stood  in a cluster upon the moor  but the blackened walls and scorched thatch  showed that it was hopeless to expect anything from them  once or twice  i spied folk in the fields or on the roadway  but at sight of an armed  horseman they ran for their lives  diving into the brushwood like wild  animals  at one place  where a high oak tree marked the meeting of three  roads  two bodies dangling from one of the branches showed that the  fears of the villagers were based upon experience  these poor men had in  all likelihood been hanged because the amount of their little hoardings  had not come up to the expectations of their plunderers  or because   having given all to one band of robbers  they had nothing with which  to appease the next  at last  when i was fairly weary of my fruitless  search for food  i espied a windmill standing upon a green hill at  the other side of some fields  judging from its appearance that it had  escaped the general pillage  i took the pathway which branched away to  it from the high road   note j  appendix        the incident is historically true  and may serve to show what sort of  men they were who had learned their soldiering under cromwell         chapter xxxiii  of my perilous adventure at the mill    at the base of the mill there stood a shed which was evidently used to  stall the horses which brought the farmers  grain  some grass was heaped  up inside it  so i loosened covenant s girths and left him to have a  hearty meal  the mill itself appeared to be silent and empty  i climbed  the steep wood ladder  and pushing the door open  walked into a round  stone flagged room  from which a second ladder led to the loft above  on  one side of this chamber was a long wooden box  and all round the walls  were ranged rows of sacks full of flour  in the fireplace stood a pile  of faggots ready for lighting  so with the aid of my tinder box i soon  had a cheerful blaze  taking a large handful of flour from the nearest  bag i moistened it with water from a pitcher  and having rolled it out  into a flat cake  proceeded to bake it  smiling the while to think of  what my mother would say to such rough cookery  very sure i am that  patrick lamb himself  whose book  the  complete court cook   was ever in  the dear soul s left hand while she stirred and basted with her right   could not have turned out a dish which was more to my taste at the  moment  for i had not even patience to wait for the browning of it  but  snapped it up and devoured it half hot  i then rolled a second one  and  having placed it before the fire  and drawn my pipe from my pocket   i set myself to smoke  waiting with all the philosophy which i could  muster until it should be ready     i was lost in thought  brooding sadly over the blow which the news would  be to my father  when i was startled by a loud sneeze  which sounded as  though it were delivered in my very ear  i started to my feet and gazed  all round me  but there was nothing save the solid wall behind and the  empty chamber before  i had almost come to persuade myself that i had  been the creature of some delusion  when again a crashing sneeze  louder  and more prolonged than the last  broke upon the silence  could some one  be hid in one of the bags  drawing my sword i walked round pricking the  great flour sacks  but without being able to find cause for the sound  i  was still marvelling over the matter when a most extraordinary chorus of  gasps  snorts  and whistles broke out  with cries of  oh  holy mother     blessed redeemer   and other such exclamations  this time there could  be no doubt as to whence the uproar came  rushing up to the great chest  upon which i had been seated  i threw back the heavy lid and gazed in     it was more than half full of flour  in the midst of which was  floundering some creature  which was so coated and caked with the white  powder  that it would have been hard to say that it was human were  it not for the pitiable cries which it was uttering  stooping down i  dragged the man from his hiding place  when he dropped upon his knees  upon the floor and yelled for mercy  raising such a cloud of dust from  every wriggle of his body that i began to cough and to sneeze  as the  skin of powder began to scale off from him  i saw to my surprise that he  was no miller or peasant  but was a man at arms  with a huge sword girt  to his side  looking at present not unlike a frosted icicle  and a  great steel faced breastplate  his steel cap had remained behind in the  flour bin  and his bright red hair  the only touch of colour about him   stood straight up in the air with terror  as he implored me to spare his  life  thinking that there was something familiar about his voice  i drew  my hand across his face  which set him yelling as though i had slain  him  there was no mistaking the heavy cheeks and the little greedy  eyes  it was none other than master tetheridge  the noisy town clerk of  taunton     but how much changed from the town clerk whom we had seen strutting  in  all the pomp and bravery of his office  before the good mayor on the day  of our coming to somersetshire  where now was the ruddy colour like a  pippin in september  where was the assured manner and the manly port  as  he knelt his great jack boots clicked together with apprehension  and he  poured forth in a piping voice  like that of a lincoln s inn mumper  a  string of pleadings  excuses  and entreaties  as though i were feversham  in person  and was about to order him to instant execution      i am but a poor scrivener man  your serene highness   he bawled    indeed  i am a most unhappy clerk  your honour  who has been driven  into these courses by the tyranny of those above him  a more loyal man   your grace  never wore neat s leather  but when the mayor says  yes    can the clerk say  no   spare me  your lordship  spare a most penitent  wretch  whose only prayer is that he may be allowed to serve king james  to the last drop of his blood       do you renounce the duke of monmouth   i asked  in a stern voice      i do  from my heart   said he fervently      then prepare to die   i roared  whipping out my sword   for i am one of  his officers      at the sight of the steel the wretched clerk gave a perfect bellow of  terror  and falling upon his face he wriggled and twisted  until looking  up he perceived that i was laughing  on that he crawled up on to his  knees once more  and from that to his feet  glancing at me askance  as  though by no means assured of my intentions      you must remember me  master tetheridge   i said   i am captain clarke   of saxon s regiment of wiltshire foot  i am surprised  indeed  that you  should have fallen away from that allegiance to which you did not only  swear yourself  but did administer the oath to so many others       not a whit  captain  not a whit   he answered  resuming his old  bantam cock manner as soon as he saw that there was no danger   i am  upon oath as true and as leal a man as ever i was       that i can fully believe   i answered      i did but dissimulate   he continued  brushing the flour from his  person   i did but practise that cunning of the serpent which should  in every warrior accompany the courage of the lion  you have read your  homer  doubtless  eh  i too have had a touch of the humanities  i am no  mere rough soldier  however stoutly i can hold mine own at sword play   master ulysses is my type  even as thine  i take it  is master ajax       methinks that master jack in the box would fit you better   said i    wilt have a half of this cake  how came you in the flour bin       why  marry  in this wise   he answered  with his mouth full of dough    it was a wile or ruse  after the fashion of the greatest commanders   who have always been famous for concealing their movements  and lurking  where they were least expected  for when the fight was lost  and i had  cut and hacked until my arm was weary and my edge blunted  i found that  i was left alone alive of all the taunton men  were we on the field you  could see where i had stood by the ring of slain which would be found  within the sweep of my sword arm  finding that all was lost and that our  rogues were fled  i mounted our worthy mayor s charger  seeing that the  gallant gentleman had no further need for it  and rode slowly from the  field  i promise you that there was that in my eye and bearing which  prevented their horse from making too close a pursuit of me  one trooper  did indeed throw himself across my path  but mine old back handed cut  was too much for him  alas  i have much upon my conscience  i have made  both widows and orphans  why will they brave me when  god of mercy  what  is that        tis but my horse in the stall below   i answered      i thought it was the dragoons   quoth the clerk  wiping away the drops  which had started out upon his brow   you and i would have gone forth  and smitten them       or climbed into the flour bin   said i      i have not yet made clear to you how i came there   he continued    having ridden  then  some leagues from the field  and noting this  windmill  it did occur to me that a stout man might single handed make  it good against a troop of horse  we have no great love of flight  we  tetheridges  it may be mere empty pride  and yet the feeling runs strong  in the family  we have a fighting strain in us ever since my kinsman  followed ireton s army as a sutler  i pulled up  therefore  and had  dismounted to take my observations  when my brute of a charger gave  the bridle a twitch  jerked itself free  and was off in an instant over  hedges and ditches  i had  therefore  only my good sword left to trust  to  i climbed up the ladder  and was engaged in planning how the defence  could best be conducted  when i heard the clank of hoofs  and on the  top of it you did ascend from below  i retired at once into ambush  from  which i should assuredly have made a sudden outfall or sally  had the  flour not so choked my breathing that i felt as though i had a two pound  loaf stuck in my gizzard  for myself  i am glad that it has so come  about  for in my blind wrath i might unwittingly have done you an  injury  hearing the clank of your sword as you did come up the ladder   i did opine that you were one of king james s minions  the captain   perchance  of some troop in the fields below       all very clear and explicit  master tetheridge   said i  re lighting  my pipe   no doubt your demeanour when i did draw you from your  hiding place was also a mere cloak for your valour  but enough of that   it is to the future that we have to look  what are your intentions       to remain with you  captain   said he      nay  that you shall not   i answered   i have no great fancy for your  companionship  your overflowing valour may bring me into ruffles which i  had otherwise avoided       nay  nay  i shall moderate my spirit   he cried   in such troublous  times you will find yourself none the worse for the company of a tried  fighting man       tried and found wanting   said i  weary of the man s braggart talk   i  tell you i will go alone       nay  you need not be so hot about it   he exclaimed  shrinking away  from me   in any case  we had best stay here until nightfall  when we  may make our way to the coast       that is the first mark of sense that you have shown   said i   the  king s horse will find enough to do with the zoyland cider and the  bridgewater ale  if we can pass through  i have friends on the north  coast who would give us a lift in their lugger as far as holland   this help i will not refuse to give you  since you are my fellow in  misfortune  i would that saxon had stayed with me  i fear he will be  taken       if you mean colonel saxon   said the clerk   i think that he also is  one who hath much guile as well as valour  a stern  fierce soldier  he was  as i know well  having fought back to back with him for forty  minutes by the clock  against a troop of sarsfield s horse  plain of  speech he was  and perhaps a trifle inconsiderate of the honour of a  cavalier  but in the field it would have been well for the army had they  had more such commanders       you say truly   i answered   but now that we have refreshed ourselves  it is time that we bethought us of taking some rest  since we may have  far to travel this night  i would that i could lay my hand upon a flagon  of ale       i would gladly drink to our further acquaintanceship in the same    said my companion   but as to the matter of slumber that may be readily  arranged  if you ascend that ladder you will find in the loft a litter  of empty sacks  upon which you can repose  for myself  i will stay down  here for a while and cook myself another cake       do you remain on watch for two hours and then arouse me   i replied    i shall then keep guard whilst you sleep   he touched the hilt of his  sword as a sign that he would be true to his post  so not without some  misgivings i climbed up into the loft  and throwing myself upon the  rude couch was soon in a deep and dreamless slumber  lulled by the low   mournful groaning and creaking of the sails     i was awoken by steps beside me  and found that the little clerk had  come up the ladder and was bending over me  i asked him if the time had  come for me to rouse  on which he answered in a strange quavering voice  that i had yet an hour  and that he had come up to see if there was any  service which he could render me  i was too weary to take much note  of his slinking manner and pallid cheeks  so thanking him for his  attention  i turned over and was soon asleep once more     my next waking was a rougher and a sterner one  there came a sudden  rush of heavy feet up the ladder  and a dozen red coats swarmed into the  room  springing on to my feet i put out my hand for the sword which i  had laid all ready by my side  but the trusty weapon had gone  it had  been stolen whilst i slumbered  unarmed and taken at a vantage  i was  struck down and pinioned in a moment  one held a pistol to my head  and  swore that he would blow my brains out if i stirred  while the others  wound a coil of rope round my body and arms  until samson himself could  scarce have got free  feeling that my struggles were of no possible  avail  i lay silent and waited for whatever was to come  neither now nor  at any time  dear children  have i laid great store upon my life  but  far less then than now  for each of you are tiny tendrils which bind me  to this world  yet  when i think of the other dear ones who are waiting  for me on the further shore  i do not think that even now death would  seem an evil thing in my eyes  what a hopeless and empty thing would  life be without it     having lashed my arms  the soldiers dragged me down the ladder  as  though i had been a truss of hay  into the room beneath  which was  also crowded with troopers  in one corner was the wretched scrivener   a picture of abject terror  with chattering teeth and trembling knees   only prevented from falling upon the floor by the grasp of a stalwart  corporal  in front of him stood two officers  one a little hard brown  man with dark twinkling eyes and an alert manner  the other tall and  slender  with a long golden moustache  which drooped down half way to  his shoulders  the former had my sword in his hand  and they were both  examining the blade curiously      it is a good bit of steel  dick   said one  putting the point against  the stone floor  and pressing down until he touched it with the handle    see  with what a snap it rebounds  no maker s name  but the date       is stamped upon the pommel  where did you get it  fellow   he asked   fixing his keen gaze upon my face      it was my father s before me   i answered      then i trust that he drew it in a better quarrel than his son hath  done   said the taller officer  with a sneer      in as good  though not in a better   i returned   that sword hath  always been drawn for the rights and liberties of englishmen  and  against the tyranny of kings and the bigotry of priests       what a tag for a playhouse  dick   cried the officer   how doth it  run   the bigotry of kings and the tyranny of priests   why  if well  delivered by betterton close up to the footlights  with one hand upon  his heart and the other pointing to the sky  i warrant the pit would  rise at it       very like   said the other  twirling his moustache   but we have no  time for fine speeches now  what are we to do with the little one       hang him   the other answered carelessly      no  no  your most gracious honours   howled master tetheridge  suddenly  writhing out of the corporal s grip and flinging himself upon the  floor at their feet   did i not tell ye where ye could find one of the  stoutest soldiers of the rebel army  did not i guide ye to him  did not  i even creep up and remove his sword lest any of the king s subjects  be slain in the taking of him  surely  surely  ye would not use me so  scurvily when i have done ye these services  have i not made good my  words  is he not as i described him  a giant in stature and of wondrous  strength  the whole army will bear me out in it  that he was worth any  two in single fight  i have given him over to ye  surely ye will let me  go       very well delivered  plaguily so   quoth the little officer  clapping  the palm of one hand softly against the back of the other   the emphasis  was just  and the enunciation clear  a little further back towards the  wings  corporal  if you please  thank you  now  dick  it is your cue       nay  john  you are too absurd   cried the other impatiently   the mask  and the buskins are well enough in their place  but you look upon the  play as a reality and upon the reality as but a play  what this reptile  hath said is true  we must keep faith with him if we wish that others of  the country folk should give up the fugitives  there is no help for it       for myself i believe in jeddart law   his companion answered   i  would hang the man first and then discuss the question of our promise   however  pink me if i will obtrude my opinion on any man       nay  it cannot be   the taller said   corporal  do you take him down   henderson will go with you  take from him that plate and sword  which  his mother would wear with as good a grace  and hark ye  corporal  a few  touches of thy stirrup leathers across his fat shoulders might not be  amiss  as helping him to remember the king s dragoons      my treacherous companion was dragged off  struggling and yelping  and  presently a series of piercing howls  growing fainter and fainter as he  fled before his tormentors  announced that the hint had been taken  the  two officers rushed to the little window of the mill and roared with  laughter  while the troopers  peeping furtively over their shoulders   could not restrain themselves from joining in their mirth  from which i  gathered that master tetheridge  as  spurred on by fear  he hurled his  fat body through hedges and into ditches  was a somewhat comical sight      and now for the other   said the little officer  turning away from the  window and wiping the tears of laughter from his face   that beam over  yonder would serve our purpose  where is hangman broderick  the jack  ketch of the royals       here i am  sir   responded a sullen  heavy faced trooper  shuffling  forward   i have a rope here with a noose       throw it over the beam  then  what is amiss with your hand  you clumsy  rogue  that you should wear linen round it       may it please you  sir   the man answered   it was all through an  ungrateful  prick eared presbyterian knave whom i hung at gommatch  i  had done all that could be done for him  had he been at tyburn he could  scarce have met with more attention  yet when i did put my hand to his  neck to see that all was as it should be  he did fix me with his teeth   and hath gnawed a great piece from my thumb       i am sorry for you   said the officer   you know  no doubt  that the  human bite under such circumstances is as deadly as that of the mad dog   so that you may find yourself snapping and barking one of these fine  mornings  nay  turn not pale  i have heard you preach patience and  courage to your victims  you are not afraid of death       not of any christian death  your honour  yet  ten shillings a week is  scarce enough to pay a man for an end like that       nay  it is all a lottery   remarked the captain cheerily   i have heard  that in these cases a man is so drawn up that his heels do beat a tattoo  against the back of his head  but  mayhap  it is not as painful as it  would appear  meanwhile  do you proceed to do your office      three or four troopers caught me by the arms  but i shook them off as  best i might  and walked with  as i trust  a steady step and a cheerful  face under the beam  which was a great smoke blackened rafter passing  from one side of the chamber to the other  the rope was thrown over  this  and the noose placed round my neck with trembling fingers by the  hangman  who took particular care to keep beyond the range of my teeth   half a dozen dragoons seized the further end of the coil  and stood  ready to swing me into eternity  through all my adventurous life i have  never been so close upon the threshold of death as at that moment  and  yet i declare to you that  terrible as my position was  i could think  of nothing but the tattoo marks upon old solomon sprent s arm  and the  cunning fashion in which he had interwoven the red and the blue  yet i  was keenly alive to all that was going on around me  the scene of the  bleak stone floored room  the single narrow window  the two lounging  elegant officers  the pile of arms in the corner  and even the texture  of the coarse red serge and the patterns of the great brass buttons upon  the sleeve of the man who held me  are all stamped clearly upon my mind      we must do our work with order   remarked the taller captain  taking a  note book from his pocket   colonel sarsfield may desire some details   let me see  this is the seventeenth  is it not       four at the farm and five at the cross roads   the other answered   counting upon his fingers   then there was the one whom we shot in the  hedge  and the wounded one who nearly saved himself by dying  and the  two in the grove under the hill  i can remember no more  save those who  were strung up in  bridgewater immediately after the action       it is well to do it in an orderly fashion   quoth the other  scribbling  in his book   it is very well for kirke and his men  who are half moors  themselves  to hang and to slaughter without discrimination or ceremony   but we should set them a better example  what is your name  sirrah       my name is captain micah clarke   i answered     the two officers looked at each other  and the smaller one gave a long  whistle   it is the very man   said he   this comes of asking questions   rat me  if i had not misgivings that it might prove to be so  they said  that he was large of limb       tell me  sirrah  have you ever known one major ogilvy of the horse  guards blue   asked the captain      seeing that i had the honour of taking him prisoner   i replied   and  seeing also that he hath shared soldier s fare and quarters with me ever  since  i think i may fairly say that i do know him       cast loose the cord   said the officer  and the hangman reluctantly  slipped the cord over my head once more   young man  you are surely  reserved for something great  for you will never be nearer your grave  until you do actually step into it  this major ogilvy hath made great  interest both for you and for a wounded comrade of yours who lies at  bridgewater  your name hath been given to the commanders of horse  with  orders to bring you in unscathed should you be taken  yet it is but fair  to tell you that though the major s good word may save you from martial  law  it will stand you in small stead before a civil judge  before whom  ye must in the end take your trial       i desire to share the same lot and fortune as has befallen my  companions in arms   i answered      nay  that is but a sullen way to take your deliverance   cried the  smaller officer   the situation is as flat as sutler s beer  otway would  have made a bettor thing of it  can you not rise to the occasion  where  is she       she  who   i asked      she  the she  the woman  your wife  sweetheart  betrothed  what you  will       there is none such   i answered      there now  what can be done in a case like that   cried he  despairingly   she should have rushed in from the wings and thrown  herself upon your bosom  i have seen such a situation earn three rounds  from the pit  there is good material spoiling here for want of some one  to work it up       we have something else to work up  jack   exclaimed his companion  impatiently   sergeant gredder  do you with two troopers conduct the  prisoner to gommatch church  it is time that we were once more upon our  way  for in a few hours the darkness will hinder the pursuit      at the word of command the troopers descended into the field where their  horses were picketed  and were speedily on the march once more  the tall  captain leading them  and the stage struck cornet bringing up the  rear  the sergeant to whose care i had been committed  a great  square shouldered  dark browed man  ordered my own horse to be brought  out  and helped me to mount it  he removed the pistols from the  holsters  however  and hung them with my sword at his own saddle bow      shall i tie his feet under the horse s belly   asked one of the  dragoons      nay  the lad hath an honest face   the sergeant answered   if he  promises to be quiet we shall cast free his arms       i have no desire to escape   said i      then untie the rope  a brave man in misfortune hath ever my goodwill   strike me dumb else  sergeant gredder is my name  formerly of mackay s  and now of the royals  as hard worked and badly paid a man as any in  his majesty s service  right wheel  and down the pathway  do ye ride  on either side  and i behind  our carbines are primed  friend  so stand  true to your promise       nay  you can rely upon it   i answered      your little comrade did play you a scurvy trick   said the sergeant    for seeing us ride down the road he did make across to us  and  bargained with the captain that his life should be spared  on condition  that he should deliver into our hands what he described as one of the  stoutest soldiers in the rebel army  truly you have thews and sinews  enough  though you are surely too young to have seen much service       this hath been my first campaign   i answered      and is like to be your last   he remarked  with soldierly frankness   i  hear that the privy council intend to make such an example as will take  the heart out of the whigs for twenty years to come  they have a lawyer  coming from london whose wig is more to be feared than our helmets  he  will slay more men in a day than a troop of horse in a ten mile chase   faith  i would sooner they took this butcher work into their own hands   see those bodies on yonder tree  it is an evil season when such acorns  grow upon english oaks       it is an evil season   said i   when men who call themselves christians  inflict such vengeance upon poor simple peasants  who have done no more  than their conscience urged them  that the leaders and officers should  suffer is but fair  they stood to win in case of success  and should pay  forfeit now that they have lost  but it goes to my heart to see those  poor godly country folk so treated       aye  there is truth in that   said the sergeant   now if it were some  of these snuffle nosed preachers  the old lank haired bell wethers who  have led their flocks to the devil  it would be another thing  why  can they not conform to the church  and be plagued to them  it is good  enough for the king  so surely it is good enough for them  or are their  souls so delicate that they cannot satisfy themselves with that on which  every honest englishman thrives  the main road to heaven is too common  for them  they must needs have each a by path of their own  and cry out  against all who will not follow it       why   said i   there are pious men of all creeds  if a man lead a life  of virtue  what matter what he believes      let a man keep his virtue in his heart   quoth sergeant gredder   let  him pack it deep in the knapsack of his soul  i suspect godliness  which shows upon the surface  the snuffling talk  the rolling eyes  the  groaning and the hawking  it is like the forged money  which can be told  by its being more bright and more showy than the real       an apt comparison   said i   but how comes it  sergeant  that you have  given attention to these matters  unless they are much belied  the royal  dragoons find other things to think of       i was one of mackay s foot   he answered shortly   i have heard of  him   said i   a man  i believe  both of parts and of piety       that  indeed  he is   cried sergeant gredder warmly   he is a man stern  and soldierly to the outer eye  but with the heart of a saint within  him  i promise you there was little need of the strapado in his  regiment  for there was not a man who did not fear the look of sorrow in  his colonel s eyes far more than he did the provost marshal      during the whole of our long ride i found the worthy sergeant a true  follower of the excellent colonel mackay  for he proved to be a man of  more than ordinary intelligence  and of serious and thoughtful habit   as to the two troopers  they rode on either side of me as silent as  statues  for the common dragoons of those days could but talk of wine  and women  and were helpless and speechless when aught else was to the  fore  when we at last rode into the little village of gommatch  which  overlooks the plain of sedgemoor  it was with regret on each side that i  bade my guardian adieu  as a parting favour i begged him to take charge  of covenant for me  promising to pay a certain sum by the month for his  keep  and commissioning him to retain the horse for his own use should i  fail to claim him within the year  it was a load off my mind when i saw  my trusty companion led away  staring back at me with questioning eyes   as though unable to understand the separation  come what might  i knew  now that  he was in the keeping of a good man who would see that no harm  befell him         chapter xxxiv  of the coming of solomon sprent    the church of gommatch was a small ivy clad building with a square  norman tower  standing in the centre of the hamlet of that name  its  great oaken doors  studded with iron  and high narrow windows  fitted  it well for the use to which it was now turned  two companies of  dumbarton s foot had been quartered in the village  with a portly major  at their head  to whom i was handed over by sergeant gredder  with some  account of my capture  and of the reasons which had prevented my summary  execution     night was now drawing in  but a few dim lamps  hung here and there upon  the walls  cast an uncertain  flickering light over the scene  a hundred  or more prisoners were scattered about upon the stone floor  many of  them wounded  and some evidently dying  the hale had gathered in silent   subdued groups round their stricken friends  and were doing what they  could to lessen their sufferings  some had even removed the greater part  of their clothing in order to furnish head rests and pallets for the  wounded  here and there in the shadows dark kneeling figures might be  seen  and the measured sound of their prayers rang through the aisles   with a groan now and again  or a choking gasp as some poor sufferer  battled for breath  the dim  yellow light streaming over the earnest  pain drawn faces  and the tattered mud coloured figures  would have made  it a fitting study for any of those low country painters whose pictures  i saw long afterwards at the hague     on thursday morning  the third day after the battle  we were all  conveyed into bridgewater  where we were confined for the remainder  of the week in st  mary s church  the very one from the tower of which  monmouth and his commanders had inspected feversham s position  the more  we heard of the fight from the soldiers and others  the more clear it  became that  but for the most unfortunate accidents  there was every  chance that our night attack might have succeeded  there was scarcely a  fault which a general could commit which feversham had not been guilty  of  he had thought too lightly of his enemy  and left his camp entirely  open to a surprise  when the firing broke out he sprang from his couch   but failing to find his wig  he had groped about his tent while the  battle was being decided  and only came out when it was well nigh over   all were agreed that had it not been for the chance of the bussex rhine  having been overlooked by our guides and scouts  we should have been  among the tents before the men could have been called to arms  only  this and the fiery energy of john churchill  the second in command   afterwards better known under a higher name  both to french and to  english history  prevented the royal army from meeting with a reverse  which might have altered the result of the campaign  note k  appendix    should ye hear or read  then  my dear children  that monmouth s rising  was easily put down  or that it was hopeless from the first  remember  that i  who was concerned in it  say confidently that it really trembled  in the balance  and that this handful of resolute peasants with their  pikes and their scythes were within an ace of altering the whole  course of english history  the ferocity of the privy council  after the  rebellion was quelled  arose from their knowledge of how very close it  had been to success     i do not wish to say too much of the cruelty and barbarity of the  victors  for it is not good for your childish ears to hear of such  doings  the sluggard feversham and the brutal kirke have earned  themselves a name in the west  which is second only to that of the arch  villain who came after them  as for their victims  when they had hanged  and quartered and done their wicked worst upon them  at least they left  their names in their own little villages  to be treasured up and handed  from generation to generation  as brave men and true who had died for a  noble cause  go now to milverton  or to wiveliscombe  or to minehead  or  to colyford  or to any village through the whole breadth and length of  somersetshire  and you will find that they have not forgotten what  they proudly call their martyrs  but where now is kirke and where is  feversham  their names are preserved  it is true  but preserved in a  county s hatred  who can fail to see now that these men in punishing  others brought a far heavier punishment upon themselves  their sin hath  indeed found them out     they did all that wicked and callous hearted men could do  knowing well  that such deeds were acceptable to the cold blooded  bigoted hypocrite  who sat upon the throne  they worked to win his favour  and they won it   men were hanged and cut down and hanged again  every cross road in the  country was ghastly with gibbets  there was not an insult or a contumely  which might make the pangs of death more unendurable  which was not  heaped upon these long suffering men  yet it is proudly recounted in  their native shire that of all the host of victims there was not one who  did not meet his end with a firm lip  protesting that if the thing were  to do again he was ready to do it     at the end of a week or two news came of the fugitives  monmouth  it  seems  had been captured by portman s yellow coats when trying to make  his way to the new forest  whence he hoped to escape to the continent   he was dragged  gaunt  unshaven  and trembling  out of a bean field in  which he had taken refuge  and was carried to ringwood  in hampshire   strange rumours reached us concerning his behaviour  rumours which came  to our ears through the coarse jests of our guards  some said that he  had gone on his knees to the yokels who had seized him  others that he  had written to the king offering to do anything  even to throw over the  protestant cause  to save his head from the scaffold  note l  appendix    we laughed at these stories at the time  and set them down as inventions  of our enemies  it seemed too impossible that at a time when his  supporters were so sternly and so loyally standing true to him  he   their leader  with the eyes of all men upon him  should be showing less  courage than every little drummer boy displays  who trips along at the  head of his regiment upon the field of battle  alas  time showed that  the stories were indeed true  and that there was no depth of infamy to  which this unhappy man would not descend  in the hope of prolonging  for a few years that existence which had proved a curse to so many who  trusted him     of saxon no news had come  good or bad  which encouraged me to hope that  he had found a hiding place for himself  reuben was still confined to  his couch by his wound  and was under the care and protection of  major ogilvy  the good gentleman came to see me more than once  and  endeavoured to add to my comfort  until i made him understand that it  pained me to find myself upon a different footing to the brave fellows  with whom i had shared the perils of the campaign  one great favour he  did me in writing to my father  and informing him that i was well and  in no pressing danger  in reply to this letter i had a stout christian  answer from the old man  bidding me to be of good courage  and quoting  largely from a sermon on patience by the reverend josiah seaton of  petersfield  my mother  he said  was in deep distress at my position   but was held up by her confidence in the decrees of providence  he  enclosed a draft for major ogilvy  commissioning him to use it in  whatever way i should suggest  this money  together with the small hoard  which my mother had sewed into my collar  proved to be invaluable  for  when the gaol fever broke out amongst us i was able to get fitting food  for the sick  and also to pay for the services of physicians  so that  the disease was stamped out ere it had time to spread     early in august we were brought from bridgewater to taunton  where we  were thrown with hundreds of others into the same wool storehouse where  our regiment had been quartered in the early days of the campaign  we  gained little by the change  save that we found that our new guards  were somewhat more satiated with cruelty than our old ones  and were  therefore less exacting upon their prisoners  not only were friends  allowed in occasionally to see us  but books and papers could be  obtained by the aid of a small present to the sergeant on duty  we were  able  therefore  to spend our time with some degree of comfort during  the month or more which passed before our trial     one evening i was standing listlessly with my back against the wall   looking up at a thin slit of blue sky which showed itself through the  narrow window  and fancying myself back in the meadows of havant once  more  when a voice fell upon my ear which did  indeed  recall me to my  hampshire home  those deep  husky tones  rising at times into an angry  roar  could belong to none other than my old friend the seaman  i  approached the door from which the uproar came  and all doubt vanished  as i listened to the conversation      won t let me pass  won t ye   he was shouting   let me tell you  i ve held on my course when better men than you have asked me to veil  topsails  i tell you i have the admiral s permit  and i won t clew up  for a bit of a red painted cock boat  so move from athwart my hawse  or  i may chance to run you down       we don t know nothing about admirals here   said the sergeant of the  guard   the time for seeing prisoners is over for the day  and if you do  not take your ill favoured body out of this i may try the weight o  my  halberd on your back       i have taken blows and given them ere you were ever thought of  you  land swab   roared old solomon   i was yardarm and yardarm with de  ruyter when you were learning to suck milk  but  old as i am  i would  have you know that i am not condemned yet  and that i am fit to exchange  broadsides with any lobster tailed piccaroon that ever was triced up to  a triangle and had the king s diamonds cut in his back  if i tack back  to major ogilvy and signal him the way that i have been welcomed  he ll  make your hide redder than ever your coat was       major ogilvy   exclaimed the sergeant  in a more respectful voice   if  you had said that your permit was from major ogilvy it would have been  another thing  but you did rave of admirals and commodores  and god  knows what other outlandish talk       shame on your parents that they should have reared you with so slight  a knowledge o  the king s english   grumbled solomon   in truth  friend   it is a marvel to me why sailor men should be able to show a lead to  those on shore in the matter of lingo  for out of seven hundred men in  the ship  worcester   the same that sank in the bay of funchal  there  was not so much as a powder boy but could understand every word that i  said  whereas on shore there is many a great jolterhead  like thyself   who might be a portugee for all the english that he knows  and who  stares at me like a pig in a hurricane if i do lint ask him what he  makes the reckoning  or how many bells have gone       whom is it that you would see   asked the sergeant gruffly   you have a  most infernally long tongue       aye  and a rough one  too  when i have fools to deal with   returned  the seaman   if i had you in my watch  lad  for a three years  cruise  i  would make a man of you yet       pass the old man through   cried the sergeant furiously  and the sailor  came stumping in  with his bronzed face all screwed up and twisted   partly with amusement at his victory over the sergeant  and partly from  a great chunk of tobacco which he was wont to stow within his cheek   having glanced round without perceiving me  he put his hands to his  mouth and bellowed out my name  with a string of  ahoys   which rang  through the building      here i am  solomon   said i  touching him on the shoulder      god bless you  lad  god bless you   he cried  wringing my hand   i  could not see you  for my port eye is as foggy as the newfoundland  banks  and has been ever since long sue williams of the point hove a  quart pot at it in the tiger inn nigh thirty year agone  how are you   all sound  alow and aloft       as well as might be   i answered   i have little to complain of       none of your standing rigging shot away   said he   no spars crippled   no shots between wind and water  eh  you have not been hulled  nor  raked  nor laid aboard of       none of these things   said i  laughing      faith  you are leaner than of old  and have aged ten years in two  months  you did go forth as smart and trim a fighting ship as over  answered helm  and now you are like the same ship when the battle and  the storm have taken the gloss from her sides and torn the love pennants  from her peak  yet am i right glad to see you sound in wind and limb       i have looked upon sights   said i   which might well add ten years to  a man s age       aye  aye   he answered  with a hollow groan  shaking his head from side  to side   it is a most accursed affair  yet  bad as the tempest is  the  calm will ever come afterwards if you will but ride it out with your  anchor placed deep in providence  ah  lad  that is good holding ground   but if i know you aright  your grief is more for these poor wretches  around you than for yourself       it is  indeed  a sore sight to see them suffer so patiently and  uncomplainingly   i answered   and for such a man  too       aye  the chicken livered swab   growled the seaman  grinding his teeth      how are my mother and my father   i asked   and how came you so far  from home       nay  i should have grounded on my beef bones had i waited longer at my  moorings  i cut my cable  therefore  and  making a northerly tack as far  as salisbury  i run down with a fair wind  thy father hath set his face  hard  and goes about his work as usual  though much troubled by the  justices  who have twice had him up to winchester for examination  but  have found his papers all right and no charge to be brought against him   your mother  poor soul  hath little time to mope or to pipe her eye  for  she hath such a sense of duty that  were the ship to founder under her   it is a plate galleon to a china orange that she would stand fast in the  caboose curing marigolds or rolling pastry  they have taken to prayer  as some would to rum  and warm their hearts with it when the wind of  misfortune blows chill  they were right glad that i should come down to  you  and i gave them the word of a sailor that i would get you out of  the bilboes if it might anyhow be done       get me out  solomon   said i   nay  that may be put outside the  question  how could you get me out       there are many ways   he answered  sinking his voice to a whisper  and  nodding his grizzled head as one who talks upon what has cost him much  time and thought   there is scuttling       scuttling       aye  lad  when i was quartermaster of the galley  providence  in the  second dutch war  we were caught betwixt a lee shore and van tromp s  squadron  so that after fighting until our sticks were shot away and our  scuppers were arun with blood  we were carried by boarding and sent as  prisoners to the texel  we were stowed away in irons in the afterhold   amongst the bilge water and the rats  with hatches battened down and  guards atop  but even then they could not keep us  for the irons got  adrift  and will adams  the carpenter s mate  picked a hole in the seams  so that the vessel nearly foundered  and in the confusion we fell upon  the prize crew  and  using our fetters as cudgels  regained possession  of the vessel  but you smile  as though there were little hopes from any  such plan       if this wool house were the galley  providence  and taunton deane were  the bay of biscay  it might be attempted   i said      i have indeed got out o  the channel   he answered  with a wrinkled  brow   there is  however  another most excellent plan which i have  conceived  which is to blow up the building       to blow it up   i cried      aye  a brace of kegs and a slow match would do it any dark night  then  where would be these walls which now shut ye in       where would be the folk that are now inside them   i asked   would you  not blow them up as well       plague take it  i had forgot that   cried solomon   nay  then  i leave  it with you  what have you to propose  do but give your sailing orders   and  with or without a consort  you will find that i will steer by them  as long as this old hulk can answer to her helm       then my advice is  my dear old friend   said i   that you leave matters  to take their course  and hie back to havant with a message from me to  those who know me  telling them to be of good cheer  and to hope for the  best  neither you nor any other man can help me now  for i have thrown  in my lot with these poor folk  and i would not leave them if i could   do what you can to cheer my mother s heart  and commend me to zachary  palmer  your visit hath been a joy to me  and your return will be the  same to them  you can serve me better so than by biding here       sink me if i like going back without a blow struck   he growled   yet  if it is your will there is an end of the matter  tell me  lad  has  that lank sparred  slab sided  herring gutted friend of yours played  you false  for if he has  by the eternal  old as i am  my hanger shall  scrape acquaintance with the longshore tuck which hangs at his girdle  i  know where he hath laid himself up  moored stem and stern  all snug and  shipshape  waiting for the turn of the tide       what  saxon   i cried   do you indeed know where he is  for god s sake  speak low  for it would mean a commission and five hundred good pounds  to any one of these soldiers could he lay hands upon him       they are scarce like to do that   said solomon   on my journey hither i  chanced to put into port at a place called bruton  where there is an  inn that will compare with most  and the skipper is a wench with a glib  tongue and a merry eye  i was drinking a glass of spiced ale  as is my  custom about six bells of the middle watch  when i chanced to notice a  great lanky carter  who was loading up a waggon in the yard with a cargo  o  beer casks  looking closer it seemed to me that the man s nose   like the beak of a goshawk  and his glinting eyes with the lids only  half reefed  were known to me  but when i overheard him swearing to  himself in good high dutch  then his figurehead came back to me in  a moment  i put out into the yard  and touched him on the shoulder   zounds  lad  you should have seen him spring back and spit at me like  a wildcat with every hair of his head in a bristle  he whipped a knife  from under his smock  for he thought  doubtless  that i was about to  earn the reward by handing him over to the red coats  i told him that  his secret was safe with me  and i asked him if he had heard that you  were laid by the heels  he answered that he knew it  and that he would  be answerable that no harm befell you  though in truth it seemed to me  that he had his hands full in trimming his own sails  without acting as  pilot to another  however  there i left him  and there i shall find him  again if so be as he has done you an injury       nay   i answered   i am right glad that he has found this refuge   we did separate upon a difference of opinion  but i have no cause  to complain of him  in many ways he hath shown me both kindness and  goodwill       he is as crafty as a purser s clerk   quoth solomon   i have seen  reuben lockarby  who sends his love to you  he is still kept in his bunk  from his wound  but he meets with good treatment  major ogilvy tells me  that he has made such interest for him that there is every chance that  he will gain his discharge  the more particularly since he was not  present at the battle  your own chance of pardon would  he thinks  be  greater if you had fought less stoutly  but you have marked yourself  as a dangerous man  more especially as you have the love of many of the  common folk among the rebels      the good old seaman stayed with me until late in the night  listening to  my adventures  and narrating in return the simple gossip of the village   which is of more interest to the absent wanderer than the rise and fall  of empires  before he left he drew a great handful of silver pieces  from his pouch  and went round amongst the prisoners  listening to their  wants  and doing what he could with rough sailor talk and dropping coins  to lighten their troubles  there is a language in the kindly eye and  the honest brow which all men may understand  and though the seaman s  speeches might have been in greek  for all that they conveyed to the  somersetshire peasants  yet they crowded round him as he departed and  called blessings upon his head  i felt as though he had brought a whiff  of his own pure ocean breezes into our close and noisome prison  and  left us the sweeter and the healthier     late in august the judges started from london upon that wicked journey  which blighted the lives and the homes of so many  and hath left a  memory in the counties through which they passed which shall never fade  while a father can speak to a son  we heard reports of them from day to  day  for the guards took pleasure in detailing them with many coarse and  foul jests  that we might know what was in store for us  and lose none  of what they called the pleasures of anticipation  at winchester the  sainted and honoured lady alice lisle was sentenced by chief justice  jeffreys to be burned alive  and the exertions and prayers of her  friends could scarce prevail upon him to allow her the small boon of  the axe instead of the faggot  her graceful head was hewn from her  body amidst the groans and the cries of a weeping multitude in the  market place of the town  at dorchester the slaughter was wholesale   three hundred were condemned to death  and seventy four were actually  executed  until the most loyal and tory of the country squires had to  complain of the universal presence of the dangling bodies  thence the  judges proceeded to exeter and thence to taunton  which they reached in  the first week of september  more like furious and ravenous beasts which  have tasted blood and cannot quench their cravings for slaughter  than  just minded men  trained to distinguish the various degrees of guilt  or  to pick out the innocent and screen him from injustice  a rare field  was open for their cruelty  for in taunton alone there lay a thousand  hapless prisoners  many of whom were so little trained to express their  thoughts  and so hampered by the strange dialect in which they spoke   that they might have been born dumb for all the chance they had of  making either judge or counsel understand the pleadings which they  wished to lay before them     it was on a monday evening that the lord chief justice made his entry   from one of the windows of the room in which we were confined i saw him  pass  first rode the dragoons with their standards and kettledrums  then  the javelin men with their halberds  and behind them the line of coaches  full of the high dignitaries of the law  last of all  drawn by six  long tailed flemish mares  came a great open coach  thickly crusted  with gold  in which  reclining amidst velvet cushions  sat the infamous  judge  wrapped in a cloak of crimson plush with a heavy white periwig  upon his head  which was so long that it dropped down over his  shoulders  they say that he wore scarlet in order to strike terror into  the hearts of the people  and that his courts were for the same reason  draped in the colour of blood  as for himself  it hath ever been the  custom  since his wickedness hath come to be known to all men  to  picture him as a man whose expression and features were as monstrous and  as hideous as was the mind behind them  this is by no means the case   on the contrary  he was a man who  in his younger days  must have been  remarkable for his extreme beauty     he was not  it is true  very old   as years go  when i saw him  but debauchery and low living had left  their traces upon his countenance  without  however entirely destroying  the regularity and the beauty of his features  he was dark  more like a  spaniard than an englishman  with black eyes and olive complexion  his  expression was lofty and noble  but his temper was so easily aflame that  the slightest cross or annoyance would set him raving like a madman   with blazing eyes and foaming mouth  i have seen him myself with the  froth upon his lips and his whole face twitching with passion  like  one who hath the falling sickness  yet his other emotions were under as  little control  for i have heard say that a very little would cause him  to sob and to weep  more especially when he had himself been slighted by  those who were above him  he was  i believe  a man who had great powers  either for good or for evil  but by pandering to the darker side of  his nature and neglecting the other  he brought himself to be as near  a fiend as it is possible for a man to be  it must indeed have been an  evil government where so vile and foul mouthed a wretch was chosen out  to hold the scales of justice  as he drove past  a tory gentleman  riding by the side of his coach drew his attention to the faces of  the prisoners looking out at him  he glanced up at them with a quick   malicious gleam of his white teeth  then settled down again amongst the  cushions  i observed that as he passed not a hat was raised among the  crowd  and that even the rude soldiers appeared to look upon him half  in terror  half in disgust  as a lion might look upon some foul   blood sucking bat which battened upon the prey which he had himself  struck down         the painting of jeffreys in the national portrait gallery more  than bears out micah clarke s remarks  he is the handsomest man in the  collection         chapter xxxv  of the devil in wig and gown    there was no delay in the work of slaughter  that very night the great  gallows was erected outside the white hart inn  hour after hour we could  hear the blows of mallets and the sawing of beams  mingled with the  shoutings and the ribald choruses of the chief justice s suite  who were  carousing with the officers of the tangiers regiment in the front room   which overlooked the gibbet  amongst the prisoners the night was passed  in prayer and meditation  the stout hearted holding forth to their  weaker brethren  and exhorting them to play the man  and to go to  their death in a fashion which should be an example to true protestants  throughout the world  the puritan divines had been mostly strung up  off hand immediately after the battle  but a few were left to sustain  the courage of their flocks  and to show them the way upon the scaffold   never have i seen anything so admirable as the cool and cheerful bravery  wherewith these poor clowns faced their fate  their courage on the  battlefield paled before that which they showed in the shambles of the  law  so amid the low murmur of prayer and appeals for mercy to god from  tongues which never yet asked mercy from man  the morning broke  the  last morning which many of us were to spend upon earth     the court should have opened at nine  but my lord chief justice was  indisposed  having sat up somewhat late with colonel kirke  it was  nearly eleven before the trumpeters and criers announced that he had  taken his seat  one by one my fellow prisoners were called out by name   the more prominent being chosen first  they went out from amongst us  amid hand shakings and blessings  but we saw and heard no more of them   save that a sudden fierce rattle of kettledrums would rise up now and  again  which was  as our guards told us  to drown any dying words which  might fall from the sufferers and bear fruit in the breasts of those who  heard them  with firm steps and smiling faces the roll of martyrs went  forth to their fate during the whole of that long autumn day  until the  rough soldiers of the guard stood silent and awed in the presence of  a courage which they could not but recognise as higher and nobler than  their own  folk may call it a trial that they received  and a trial it  really was  but not in the sense that we englishmen use it  it was but  being haled before a judge  and insulted before being dragged to the  gibbet  the court house was the thorny path which led to the scaffold   what use to put a witness up  when he was shouted down  cursed at   and threatened by the chief justice  who bellowed and swore until the  frightened burghers in fore street could hear him  i have heard from  those who were there that day that he raved like a demoniac  and that  his black eyes shone with a vivid vindictive brightness which was scarce  human  the jury shrank from him as from a venomous thing when he  turned his baleful glance upon them  at times  as i have been told  his  sternness gave place to a still more terrible merriment  and he would  lean back in his seat of justice and laugh until the tears hopped down  upon his ermine  nearly a hundred were either executed or condemned to  death upon that opening day     i had expected to be amongst the first of those called  and no doubt i  should have been so but for the exertions of major ogilvy  as it was   the second day passed  but i still found myself overlooked  on the  third and fourth days the slaughter was slackened  not on account of  any awakening grace on the part of the judge  but because the great tory  landowners  and the chief supporters of the government  had still some  bowels of compassion  which revolted at this butchery of defenceless  men  had it not been for the influence which these gentlemen brought  to bear upon the judge  i have no doubt at all that jeffreys would have  hung the whole eleven hundred prisoners then confined in taunton  as  it was  two hundred and fifty fell victims to this accursed monster s  thirst for human blood     on the eighth day of the assizes there were but fifty of us left in  the wool warehouse  for the last few days prisoners had been tried  in batches of ten and twenty  but now the whole of us were taken in  a drove  under escort  to the court house  where as many as could be  squeezed in were ranged in the dock  while the rest were penned  like  calves in the market  in the body of the hall  the judge reclined in a  high chair  with a scarlet dais above him  while two other judges  in  less elevated seats  were stationed on either side of him  on the right  hand was the jury box  containing twelve carefully picked men  tories  of the old school  firm upholders of the doctrines of non resistance and  the divine right of kings  much care had been taken by the crown in  the choice of these men  and there was not one of them but would have  sentenced his own father had there been so much as a suspicion that he  leaned to presbyterianism or to whiggery  just under the judge was a  broad table  covered with green cloth and strewn with papers  on  the right hand of this were a long array of crown lawyers  grim   ferret faced men  each with a sheaf of papers in his hands  which they  sniffed through again and again  as though they were so many bloodhounds  picking up the trail along which they were to hunt us down  on the other  side of the table sat a single fresh faced young man  in silk gown and  wig  with a nervous  shuffling manner  this was the barrister  master  helstrop  whom the crown in its clemency had allowed us for our defence   lest any should be bold enough to say that we had not had every fairness  in our trial  the remainder of the court was filled with the servants  of the justices  retinue and the soldiers of the garrison  who used the  place as their common lounge  looking on the whole thing as a mighty  cheap form of sport  and roaring with laughter at the rude banter and  coarse pleasantries of his lordship     the clerk having gabbled through the usual form that we  the prisoners  at the bar  having shaken off the fear of god  had unlawfully and  traitorously assembled  and so onwards  the lord justice proceeded to  take matters into his own hands  as was his wont      i trust that we shall come well out of this   he broke out   i  trust that no judgment will fall upon this building  was ever so much  wickedness fitted into one court house before  who ever saw such an  array of villainous faces  ah  rogues  i see a rope ready for every  one of ye  art not afraid of judgment  art not afraid of hell fire  you  grey bearded rascal in the corner  how comes it that you have not had  more of the grace of god in you than to take up arms against your most  gracious and loving sovereign       i have followed the guidance of my conscience  my lord   said the  venerable cloth worker of wellington  to whom he spoke      ha  your conscience   howled jeffreys   a ranter with a conscience   where has your conscience been these two months back  you villain and  rogue  your conscience will stand you in little stead  sirrah  when  you are dancing on nothing with a rope round your neck  was ever such  wickedness  who ever heard such effrontery  and you  you great hulking  rebel  have you not grace enough to cast your eyes down  but must needs  look justice in the face as though you were an honest man  are you not  afeared  sirrah  do you not see death close upon you       i have seen that before now  my lord  and i was not afeared   i  answered      generation of vipers   he cried  throwing up his hands   the best of  fathers  the kindest of kings  see that my words are placed upon the  record  clerk  the most indulgent of parents  but wayward children  must  with all kindness  be flogged into obedience  here he broke into  a savage grin   the king will save your own natural parents all further  care on your account  if they had wished to keep ye  they should have  brought ye up in better principles  rogues  we shall be merciful to  ye  oh  merciful  merciful  how many are here  recorder       fifty and one  my lord       oh  sink of villainy  fifty and one as arrant knaves as ever lay on  a hurdle  oh  what a mass of corruption have we here  who defends the  villains       i defend the prisoners  your lordship   replied the young lawyer      master helstrop  master helstrop   cried jeffreys  shaking his great  wig until the powder flew out of it   you are in all these dirty cases   master helstrop  you might find yourself in a parlous condition  master  helstrop  i think sometimes that i see you yourself in the dock  master  helstrop  you may yourself soon need the help of a gentleman of the long  robe  master helstrop  oh  have a care  have a care       the brief is from the crown  your lordship   the lawyer answered  in a  quavering voice      must i be answered back  then   roared jeffreys  his black eyes blazing  with the rage of a demon   am i to be insulted in my own court  is every  five groat piece of a pleader  because he chance to have a wig and a  gown  to browbeat the lord justice  and to fly in the face of the ruling  of the court  oh  master helstrop  i fear that i shall live to see some  evil come upon you       i crave your lordship s pardon   cried the faint hearted barrister   with his face the colour of his brief      keep a guard upon your words and upon your actions   jeffreys answered   in a menacing voice   see that you are not too zealous in the cause  of the scum of the earth  how now  then  what do these one and fifty  villains desire to say for themselves  what is their lie  gentlemen of  the jury  i beg that ye will take particular notice of the cut throat  faces of these men   tis well that colonel kirke hath afforded the court  a sufficient guard  for neither justice nor the church is safe at their  hands       forty of them desire to plead guilty to the charge of taking up arms  against the king   replied our barrister      ah   roared the judge   was ever such unparalleled impudence  was there  ever such brazen effrontery  guilty  quotha  have they expressed their  repentance for this sin against a most kind and long suffering monarch   put down those words on the record  clerk       they have refused to express repentance  your lordship   replied the  counsel for the defence      oh  the parricides  oh  the shameless rogues   cried the judge   put  the forty together on this side of the enclosure  oh  gentlemen  have ye  ever seen such a concentration of vice  see how baseness and wickedness  can stand with head erect  oh  hardened monsters  but the other eleven   how can they expect us to believe this transparent falsehood  this  palpable device  how can they foist it upon the court       my lord  their defence hath not yet been advanced   stammered master  helstrop      i can sniff a lie before it is uttered   roared the judge  by no means  abashed   i can read it as quick as ye can think it  come  come  the  court s time is precious  put forward a defence  or seat yourself  and  let judgment be passed       these men  my lord   said the counsel  who was trembling until the  parchment rattled in his hand   these eleven men  my lord        eleven devils  my lord   interrupted jeffreys      they are innocent peasants  my lord  who love god and the king  and  have in no wise mingled themselves in this recent business  they have  been dragged from their homes  my lord  not because there was suspicion  against them  but because they could not satisfy the greed of certain  common soldiers who were balked of plunder in        oh  shame  shame   cried jeffreys  in a voice of thunder   oh   threefold shame  master helstrop  are you not content with bolstering  up rebels  but you must go out of your way to slander the king s troops   what is this world coming to  what  in a word  is the defence of these  rogues       an alibi  your lordship       ha  the common plea of every scoundrel  have they witnesses       we have here a list of forty witnesses  your lordship  they are waiting  below  many of them having come great distances  and with much toil and  trouble       who are they  what are they   cried jeffreys      they are country folk  your lordship  cottagers and farmers  the  neighbours of these poor men  who knew them well  and can speak as to  their doings       cottagers and farmers   the judge shouted   why  then  they are drawn  from the very class from which these men come  would you have us believe  the oath of those who are themselves whigs  presbyterians  somersetshire  ranters  the pothouse companions of the men whom we are trying  i  warrant they have arranged it all snugly over their beer  snugly   snugly  the rogues       will you not hear the witnesses  your lordship   cried our counsel   shamed into some little sense of manhood by this outrage      not a word from them  sirrah   said jeffreys   it is a question whether  my duty towards my kind master the king  write down  kind master    clerk  doth not warrant me in placing all your witnesses in the dock as  the aiders and abettors of treason       if it please your lordship   cried one of the prisoners   i have for  witnesses mr  johnson  of nether stowey  who is a good tory  and also  mr  shepperton  the clergyman       the more shame to them to appear in such a cause   replied jeffreys    what are we to say  gentlemen of the jury  when we see county gentry  and the clergy of the established church supporting treason and  rebellion in this fashion  surely the last days are at hand  you are a  most malignant and dangerous whig to have so far drawn them from their  duty       but hear me  my lord   cried one of the prisoners      hear you  you bellowing calf   shouted the judge   we can hear naught  else  do you think that you are back in your conventicle  that you  should dare to raise your voice in such a fashion  hear you  quotha  we  shall hear you at the end of a rope  ere many days       we scarce think  your lordship   said one of the crown lawyers   springing to his feet amid a great rustling of papers   we scarce think  that it is necessary for the crown to state any case  we have already  heard the whole tale of this most damnable and execrable attempt many  times over  the men in the dock before your lordship have for the most  part confessed to their guilt  and of those who hold out there is not  one who has given us any reason to believe that he is innocent of  the foul crime laid to his charge  the gentlemen of the long robe are  therefore unanimously of opinion that the jury may at once be required  to pronounce a single verdict upon the whole of the prisoners       which is     asked jeffreys  glancing round at the foreman       guilty  your lordship   said he  with a grin  while his brother jurymen  nodded their heads and laughed to one another      of course  of course  guilty as judas iscariot   cried the judge   looking down with exultant eyes at the throng of peasants and burghers  before him   move them a little forwards  ushers  that i may see them  to more advantage  oh  ye cunning ones  are ye not taken  are ye not  compassed around  where now can ye fly  do ye not see hell opening  at your feet  eh  are ye not afraid  oh  short  short shall be your  shrift   the very devil seemed to be in the man  for as he spoke he  writhed with unholy laughter  and drummed his hand upon the red cushion  in front of him  i glanced round at my companions  but their faces were  all as though they had been chiselled out of marble  if he had hoped to  see a moist eye or a quivering lip  the satisfaction was denied him      had i my way   said he   there is not one of ye but should swing for  it  aye  and if i had my way  some of those whose stomachs are too nice  for this work  and who profess to serve the king with their lips while  they intercede for his worst enemies  should themselves have cause to  remember taunton assizes  oh  most ungrateful rebels  have ye not  heard how your most soft hearted and compassionate monarch  the best of  men  put it down in the record  clerk  on the intercession of that great  and charitable statesman  lord sunderland  mark it down  clerk  hath  had pity on ye  hath it not melted ye  hath it not made ye loathe  yourselves  i declare  when i think of it   here  with a sudden catching  of the breath  he burst out a sobbing  the tears running down his  cheeks   when i think of it  the christian forbearance  the ineffable  mercy  it doth bring forcibly to my mind that great judge before whom  all of us  even i  shall one day have to render an account  shall i  repeat it  clerk  or have you it down       i have it down  your lordship       then write  sobs  in the margin   tis well that the king should  know our opinion on such matters  know  then  you most traitorous and  unnatural rebels  that this good father whom ye have spurned has stepped  in between yourselves and the laws which ye have offended  at his  command we withhold from ye the chastisement which ye have merited   if ye can indeed pray  and if your soul cursing conventicles have not  driven all grace out of ye  drop on your knees and offer up thanks when  i tell ye that he hath ordained that ye shall all have a free pardon    here the judge rose from his seat as though about to descend from the  tribunal  and we gazed upon each other in the utmost astonishment at  this most unlooked for end to the trial  the soldiers and lawyers were  equally amazed  while a hum of joy and applause rose up from the few  country folk who had dared to venture within the accursed precincts      this pardon  however   continued jeffreys  turning round with a  malicious smile upon his face   is coupled with certain conditions and  limitations  ye shall all be removed from here to poole  in chains   where ye shall find a vessel awaiting ye  with others ye shall be stowed  away in the hold of the said vessel  and conveyed at the king s expense  to the plantations  there to be sold as slaves  god send ye masters who  will know by the free use of wood and leather to soften your stubborn  thoughts and incline your mind to better things   he was again about to  withdraw  when one of the crown lawyers whispered something across to  him      well thought of  coz   cried the judge   i had forgot  bring back the  prisoners  ushers  perhaps ye think that by the plantations i mean his  majesty s american dominions  unhappily  there are too many of your  breed in that part already  ye would fall among friends who might  strengthen ye in your evil courses  and so risk your salvation  to send  ye there would be to add one brand to another and yet hope to put  out the fire  by the plantations  therefore  i mean barbadoes and the  indies  where ye shall live with the other slaves  whose skins may be  blacker than yours  but i dare warrant that their souls are more white    with this concluding speech the trial ended  and we were led back  through the crowded streets to the prison from which we had been  brought  on either side of the street  as we passed  we could see  the limbs of former companions dangling in the wind  and their heads  grinning at us from the tops of poles and pikes  no savage country in  the heart of heathen africa could have presented a more dreadful sight  than did the old english town of taunton when jeffreys and kirke had  the ordering of it  there was death in the air  and the townsfolk crept  silently about  scarcely daring to wear black for those whom they had  loved and lost  lest it should be twisted into an act of treason     we were scarce back in the wool house once more when a file of  guards with a sergeant entered  escorting a long  pale faced man with  protruding teeth  whose bright blue coat and white silk breeches   gold headed sword  and glancing shoe buckles  proclaimed him to be one  of those london exquisites whom interest or curiosity had brought down  to the scene of the rebellion  he tripped along upon his tiptoes like a  french dancing master  waving his scented kerchief in front of his  thin high nose  and inhaling aromatic salts from a blue phial which he  carried in his left hand      by the lard   he cried   but the stench of these filthy wretches is  enough to stap one s breath  it is  by the lard  smite my vitals if  i would venture among them if i were not a very rake hell  is there a  danger of prison fever  sergeant  heh       they are all sound as roaches  your honour   said the under officer   touching his cap      heh  heh   cried the exquisite  with a shrill treble laugh   it is  not often ye have a visit from a person of quality  i ll warrant  it  is business  sergeant  business   auri sacra fames   you remember what  virgilius maro says  sergeant       never heard the gentleman speak  sir  at least not to my knowledge   sir   said the sergeant      heh  heh  never heard him speak  heh  that will do for slaughter s   sergeant  that will set them all in a titter at slaughter s  pink my  soul  but when i venture on a story the folk complain that they can t  get served  for the drawers laugh until there is no work to be got out  of them  oh  lay me bleeding  but these are a filthy and most ungodly  crew  let the musqueteers stand close  sergeant  lest they fly at me       we shall see to that  your honour       i have a grant of a dozen of them  and captain pogram hath offered me  twelve pounds a head  but they must be brawny rogues  strong and brawny   for the voyage kills many  sergeant  and the climate doth also tell upon  them  now here is one whom i must have  yes  in very truth he is a  young man  and hath much life in him and much strength  tick him off   sergeant  tick him off       his name is clarke   said the soldier   i have marked him down       if this is the clerk i would i had a parson to match him   cried the  fop  sniffing at his bottle   do you see the pleasantry  sergeant  heh   heh  does your sluggish mind rise to the occasion  strike me purple  but  i am in excellent fettle  there is yonder man with the brown face  you  can mark him down  and the young man beside him  also  tick him off  ha   he waves his hand towards me  stand firm  sergeant  where are my salts   what is it  man  what is it       if it plaize your han r   said the young peasant   if so be as you  have chose me to be of a pairty  i trust that you will allow my vaither  yander to go with us also       pshaw  pshaw   cried the fop   you are beyond reason  you are indeed   who ever heard of such a thing  honour forbids it  how could i foist  an old man upon mine honest friend  captain pogram  fie  fie  split  me asunder if he would not say that i had choused him  there is yonder  lusty fellow with the red head  sergeant  the blacks will think he is  a fire  those  and these six stout yokels  will make up my dozen       you have indeed the pick of them   said the sergeant      aye  sink me  but i have a quick eye for horse  man  or woman  i ll  pick the best of a batch with most  twelve twelves  close on a hundred  and fifty pieces  sergeant  and all for a few words  my friend  all for  a few words  i did but send my wife  a demmed handsome woman  mark you   and dresses in the mode  to my good friend the secretary to ask for some  rebels   how many   says he   a dozen will do   says she  it was all  done in a penstroke  what a cursed fool she was not to have asked for a  hundred  but what is this  sergeant  what is this      a small  brisk  pippin faced fellow in a riding coat and high boots had  come clanking into the wool house with much assurance and authority   with a great old fashioned sword trailing behind him  and a riding whip  switching in his hand      morning  sergeant   said he  in a loud  overbearing voice   you may  have heard my name  i am master john wooton  of langmere house  near  dulverton  who bestirred himself so for the king  and hath been termed  by mr  godolphin  in the house of commons  one of the local pillars of  the state  those were his words  fine  were they not  pillars  mark ye   the conceit being that the state was  as it were  a palace or a temple   and the loyal men so many pillars  amongst whom i also was one  i am a  local pillar  i have received a royal permit  sergeant  to choose from  amongst your prisoners ten sturdy rogues whom i may sell as a reward  to me for my exertions  draw them up  therefore  that i may make my  choice       then  sir  we are upon the same errand   quoth the londoner  bowing  with his hand over his heart  until his sword seemed to point straight  up to the ceiling   the honourable george dawnish  at your service  your  very humble and devoted servant  sir  yours to command in any or  all ways  it is a real joy and privilege to me  sir  to make your  distinguished acquaintance  hem      the country squire appeared to be somewhat taken aback at this shower  of london compliments   ahem  sir  yes  sir   said he  bobbing his head    glad to see you  sir  most damnably so  but these men  sergeant  time  presses  for to morrow is shepton market  and i would fain see my old  twenty score boar once more before he is sold  there is a beefy one   i ll have him       ged  i ve forestalled you   cried the courtier   sink me  but it gives  me real pain  he is mine       then this   said the other  pointing with his whip      he is mine  too  heh  heh  heh  strike me stiff  but this is too  funny       od s wounds  how many are yours   cried the dulverton squire      a dozen  heh  heh  a round dozen  all those who stand upon this side   pink me  but i have got the best of you there  the early bird  you know  the old saw       it is a disgrace   the squire cried hotly   a shame and a disgrace  we  must needs fight for the king and risk our skins  and then when all is  done  down come a drove of lacqueys in waiting  and snap up the pickings  before their betters are served       lacqueys in waiting  sir   shrieked the exquisite   s death  sir  this  toucheth mine honour very nearly  i have seen blood flow  yes  sir  and  wounds gape on less provocation  retract  sir  retract       away  you clothes pole   cried the other contemptuously   you are come  like the other birds of carrion when the fight is o er  have you been  named in full parliament  are you a local pillar  away  away  you  tailor s dummy       you insolent clodhopper   cried the fop   you most foul mouthed  bumpkin  the only local pillar that you have ever deserved to make  acquaintance with is the whipping post  ha  sergeant  he lays his  hand upon his sword  stop him  sergeant  stop him  or i may do him an  injury       nay  gentlemen   cried the under officer   this quarrel must not  continue here  we must have no brawling within the prison  yet there is  a level turf without  and as fine elbow room as a gentleman could wish  for a breather      this proposal did not appear to commend itself to either of the angry  gentlemen  who proceeded to exchange the length of their swords  and to  promise that each should hear from the other before sunset  our owner   as i may call him  the fop  took his departure at last  and the country  squire having chosen the next ton swaggered off  cursing the courtiers   the londoners  the sergeant  the prisoners  and above all  the  ingratitude of the government which had made him so small a return  for his exertions  this was but the first of many such scenes  for the  government  in endeavouring to satisfy the claims of its supporters  had  promised many more than there were prisoners  i am grieved to say that  i have seen not only men  but even my own countrywomen  and ladies of  title to boot  wringing their hands and bewailing themselves because  they were unable to get any of the poor somersetshire folk to sell as  slaves  indeed  it was only with difficulty that they could be made  to see that their claim upon government did not give them the right of  seizing any burgher or peasant who might come in their way  and shipping  him right off for the plantations     well  my dear grandchildren  from night to night through this long and  weary winter i have taken you back with me into the past  and made you  see scenes the players in which are all beneath the turf  save  that perhaps here and there some greybeard like myself may have a  recollection of them  i understand that you  joseph  have every morning  set down upon paper that which i have narrated the night before  it is  as well that you should do so  for your own children and your children s  children may find it of interest  and even perhaps take a pride in  hearing that their ancestors played a part in such scenes  but now  the spring is coming  and the green is bare of snow  so that there are  better things for you to do than to sit listening to the stories of  a garrulous old man  nay  nay  you shake your heads  but indeed those  young limbs want exercising and strengthening and knitting together   which can never come from sitting toasting round the blaze  besides  my  story draws quickly to an end now  for i had never intended to tell you  more than the events connected with the western rising  if the closing  part hath been of the dreariest  and if all doth not wind up with  the ringing of bells and the joining of hands  like the tales in the  chap books  you must blame history and not me  for truth is a stern  mistress  and when one hath once started off with her one must follow  on after the jade  though she lead in flat defiance of all the rules and  conditions which would fain turn that tangled wilderness the world into  the trim dutch garden of the story tellers     three days after our trial we were drawn up in north street in front  of the castle with others from the other prisons who were to share our  fate  we were placed four abreast  with a rope connecting each rank   and of these ranks i counted fifty  which would bring our total to two  hundred  on each side of us rode dragoons  and in front and behind were  companies of musqueteers to prevent any attempt at rescue or escape   in this order we set off upon the tenth day of september  amidst the  weeping and wailing of the townsfolk  many of whom saw their sons or  brothers marching off into exile without their being able to exchange a  last word or embrace with them  some of these poor folk  doddering old  men and wrinkled  decrepit women  toiled for miles after us down the  high road  until the rearguard of foot faced round upon them  and drove  them away with curses and blows from their ramrods     that day we made our way through yeovil and sherborne  and on the morrow  proceeded over the north downs as far as blandford  where we were penned  together like cattle and left for the night  on the third day we  resumed our march through wimbourne and a line of pretty dorsetshire  villages  the last english villages which most of us were destined to  see for many a long year to come  late in the afternoon the spars and  rigging of the shipping in poole harbour rose up before us  and in  another hour we had descended the steep and craggy path which leads to  the town  here we were drawn up upon the quay opposite the broad decked   heavy sparred brig which was destined to carry us into slavery  through  all this march we met with the greatest kindness from the common people   who flocked out from their cottages with fruit and with milk  which  they divided amongst us  at other places  at  the risk of their lives   dissenting ministers came forth and stood by the wayside  blessing us as  we passed  in spite of the rough jeers and oaths of the soldiers     we were marched aboard and led below by the mate of the vessel  a tall  red faced seaman with ear rings in his ears  while the captain stood on  the poop with his legs apart and a pipe in his mouth  checking us off  one by one by means of a list which he held in his hand  as he looked  at the sturdy build and rustic health of the peasants  which even their  long confinement had been unable to break down  his eyes glistened  and  he rubbed his big red hands together with delight      show them down  jem   he kept shouting to the mate   stow them safe   jem  there s lodgings for a duchess down there  s help me  there s  lodgings for a duchess  pack  em away      one by one we passed before the delighted captain  and down the steep  ladder which led into the hold  here we were led along a narrow passage   on either side of which opened the stalls which were prepared for us  as  each man came opposite to the one set aside for him he was thrown into  it by the brawny mate  and fastened down with anklets of iron by the  seaman armourer in attendance  it was dark before we were all secured   but the captain came round with a lanthorn to satisfy himself that all  his property was really safe  i could hear the mate and him reckoning  the value of each prisoner  and counting what he would fetch in the  barbadoes market      have you served out their fodder  jem   he asked  flashing his light  into each stall in turn   have you seen that they had their rations       a rye bread loaf and a pint o  water   answered the mate      fit for a duchess  s help me   cried the captain   look to this one   jem  he is a lusty rogue  look to his great hands  he might work for  years in the rice swamps ere the land crabs have the picking of him       aye  we ll have smart bidding amid the settlers for this lot   cod   captain  but you have made a bargain of it  od s bud  you have done  these london fools to some purpose       what is this   roared the captain   here is one who hath not touched  his allowance  how now  sirrah  art too dainty in the stomach to eat  what your betters have eaten before you       i have no hairt for food  zur   the prisoner answered      what  you must have your whims and fancies  you must pick and you must  choose  i tell you  sirrah  that you are mine  body and soul  twelve  good pieces i paid for you  and now  forsooth  i am to be told that you  will not eat  turn to it at this instant  you saucy rogue  or i shall  have you triced to the triangles       here is another   said the mate   who sits ever with his head sunk upon  his breast without spirit or life       mutinous  obstinate dog   cried the captain   what ails you then  why  have you a face like an underwriter in a tempest       if it plaize you  zur   the prisoner answered   oi do but think o  m   ould mother at wellington  and woonder who will kape her now that oi m  gone       and what is that to me   shouted the brutal seaman   how can you arrive  at your journey s end sound and hearty if you sit like a sick fowl upon  a perch  laugh  man  and be merry  or i will give you something to weep  for  out on you  you chicken hearted swab  to sulk and fret like a babe  new weaned  have you not all that heart could desire  give him a touch  with the rope s end  jem  if ever you do observe him fretting  it is but  to spite us that he doth it       if it please your honour   said a seaman  coming hurriedly down from  the deck   there is a stranger upon the poop who will have speech with  your honour       what manner of man  sirrah       surely he is a person of quality  your honour  he is as free wi  his  words as though he were the captain o  the ship  the boatswain did but  jog against him  and he swore so woundily at him and stared at him so   wi  een like a tiger cat  that job harrison says we have shipped the  devil himsel   the men don t like the look of him  your honour       who the plague can this spark be   said the skipper   go on deck  jem   and tell him that i am counting my live stock  and that i shall be with  him anon       nay  your honour  there will trouble come of it unless you come up  he  swears that he will not bear to be put off  and that he must see you on  the instant       curse his blood  whoever he be   growled the seaman   every cock on  his own dunghill  what doth the rogue mean  were he the lord high privy  seal  i would have him to know that i am lord of my own quarter deck    so saying  with many snorts of indignation  the mate and the captain  withdrew together up the ladder  banging the heavy hatchways down as  they passed through     a single oil lamp swinging from a beam in the centre of the gangway  which led between the rows of cells was the only light which was  vouchsafed us  by its yellow  murky glimmer we could dimly see the great  wooden ribs of the vessel  arching up on either side of us  and crossed  by the huge beams which held the deck  a grievous stench from foul bilge  water poisoned the close  heavy air  every now and then  with a squeak  and a clutter  a rat would dart across the little zone of light and  vanish in the gloom upon the further side  heavy breathing all round  me showed that my companions  wearied out by their journey and their  sufferings  had dropped into a slumber  from time to time one could hear  the dismal clank of fetters  and the start and incatching of the breath   as some poor peasant  fresh from dreams of his humble homestead amid the  groves of the mendips  awoke of a sudden to see the great wooden coffin  around him  and to breathe the venomous air of the prison ship     i lay long awake full of thought both for myself and for the poor souls  around me  at last  however  the measured swash of the water against  the side of the vessel and the slight rise and fall had lulled me into  a sleep  from which i was suddenly aroused by the flashing of a light  in my eyes  sitting up  i found several sailors gathered about me  and  a tall man with a black cloak swathed round him swinging a lanthorn over  me      that is the man   he said      come  mate  you are to come on deck   said the seaman armourer  with a  few blows from his hammer he knocked the irons from my feet      follow me   said the tall stranger  and led the way up the hatchway  ladder  it was heavenly to come out into the pure air once more  the  stars were shining brightly overhead  a fresh breeze blew from the  shore  and hummed a pleasant tune among the cordage  close beside us  the lights of the town gleamed yellow and cheery  beyond  the moon was  peeping over the bournemouth hills      this way  sir   said the sailor   right aft into the cabin  sir      still following my guide  i found myself in the low cabin of the brig   a square shining table stood in the centre  with a bright swinging  lamp above it  at the further end in the glare of the light sat the  captain  his face shining with greed and expectation  on the table stood  a small pile of gold pieces  a rum flask  glasses  a tobacco box  and  two long pipes      my compliments to you  captain clarke   said the skipper  bobbing his  round bristling head   an honest seaman s compliments to you  it seems  that we are not to be shipmates this voyage  after all       captain micah clarke must do a voyage of his own   said the stranger     at the sound of his voice i sprang round in amazement   good heavens   i  cried   saxon       you have nicked it   said he  throwing down his mantle and showing the  well known face and figure of the soldier of fortune   zounds  man  if  you can pick me out of the solent  i suppose that i may pick you out of  this accursed rat trap in which i find you  tie and tie  as we say at  the green table  in truth  i was huffed with you when last we parted   but i have had you in my mind for all that       a seat and a glass  captain clarke   cried the skipper   od s bud  i  should think that you would be glad to raise your little finger and wet  your whistle after what you have gone through      i seated myself by the table with my brain in a whirl   this is more  than i can fathom   said i   what is the meaning of it  and how comes it  about       for my own part  the meaning is as clear as the glass of my binnacle    quoth the seaman   your good friend colonel saxon  as i understand his  name to be  has offered me as much as i could hope to gain by selling  you in the indies  sink it  i may be rough and ready  but my heart is in  the right place  aye  aye  i would not maroon a man if i could set him  free  but we have all to look for ourselves  and trade is dull       then i am free   said i      you are free   he answered   there is your purchase money upon the  table  you can go where you will  save only upon the land of england   where you are still an outlaw under sentence       how have you done this  saxon   i asked   are you not afraid for  yourself       ho  ho   laughed the old soldier   i am a free man  my lad  i hold my  pardon  and care not a maravedi for spy or informer  who should i meet  but colonel kirke a day or so back  yes  lad  i met him in the street   and i cocked my hat in his face  the villain laid his hand upon his  hilt  and i should have out bilbo and sent his soul to hell had they not  come between us  i care not the ashes of this pipe for jeffreys or any  other of them  i can snap this finger and thumb at them  so  they would  rather see decimus saxon s back than his face  i promise ye       but how comes this about   i asked      why  marry  it is no mystery  cunning old birds are not to be caught  with chaff  when i left you i made for a certain inn where i could count  upon finding a friend  there i lay by for a while  en cachette  as the  messieurs call it  while i could work out the plan that was in my head   donner wetter  but i got a fright from that old seaman friend of yours   who should be sold as a picture  for he is of little use as a man  well   i bethought me early in the affair of your visit to badminton  and of  the duke of b  we shall mention no names  but you can follow my meaning   to him i sent a messenger  to the effect that i purposed to purchase my  own pardon by letting out all that i knew concerning his double dealing  with the rebels  the message was carried to him secretly  and his  answer was that i should meet him at a certain spot by night  i sent my  messenger instead of myself  and he was found in the morning stiff and  stark  with more holes in his doublet than ever the tailor made  on  this i sent again  raising my demands  and insisting upon a speedy  settlement  he asked my conditions  i replied  a free pardon and a  command for myself  for you  money enough to land you safely in some  foreign country where you can pursue the noble profession of arms  i got  them both  though it was like drawing teeth from his head  his name hath  much power at court just now  and the king can refuse him nothing  i  have my pardon and a command of troops in new england  for you i have  two hundred pieces  of which thirty have been paid in ransom to the  captain  while twenty are due to me for my disbursements over the  matter  in this bag you will find the odd hundred and fifty  of which  you will pay fifteen to the fishermen who have promised to see you safe  to flushing      i was  as you may readily believe  my dear children  bewildered by this  sudden and most unlooked for turn which events had taken  when saxon had  ceased to speak i sat as one stunned  trying to realise what he had said  to me  there came a thought into my head  however  which chilled the  glow of hope and of happiness which had sprung up in me at the thought  of recovering my freedom  my presence had been a support and a comfort  to my unhappy companions  would it not be a cruel thing to leave them in  their distress  there was not one of them who did not look to me in his  trouble  and to the best of my poor power i had befriended and consoled  them  how could i desert them now      i am much beholden to you  saxon   i said at last  speaking slowly and  with some difficulty  for the words were hard to utter   but i fear that  your pains have been thrown away  these poor country folk have none to  look after or assist them  they are as simple as babes  and as little  fitted to be landed in a strange country  i cannot find it in my heart  to leave them      saxon burst out laughing  and leaned back in his seat with his long legs  stretched straight out and his hands in his breeches pockets      this is too much   he said at last   i saw many difficulties in my way   yet i did not foresee this one  you are in very truth the most contrary  man that ever stood in neat s leather  you have ever some outlandish  reason for jibbing and shying like a hot blooded  half broken colt  yet  i think that i can overcome these strange scruples of yours by a little  persuasion       as to the prisoners  captain clarke   said the seaman   i ll be as good  as a father to them  s help me  i will  on the word of an honest sailor   if you should choose to lay out a trifle of twenty pieces upon their  comfort  i shall see that their food is such as mayhap many of them  never got at their own tables  they shall come on deck  too  in watches   and have an hour or two o  fresh air in the day  i can t say fairer       a word or two with you on deck   said saxon  he walked out of the cabin  and i followed him to the far end of the poop  where we stood leaning  against the bulwarks  one by one the lights had gone out in the town   until the black ocean beat against a blacker shore      you need not have any fear of the future of the prisoners   he said   in a low whisper   they are not bound for the barbadoes  nor will this  skinflint of a captain have the selling of them  for all that he is so  cocksure  if he can bring his own skin out of the business  it will be  more than i expect  he hath a man aboard his ship who would think no  more of giving him a tilt over the side than i should       what mean you  saxon   i cried      hast ever heard of a man named marot       hector marot  yes  surely i knew him well  a highwayman he was  but a  mighty stout man with a kind heart beneath a thief s jacket       the same  he is as you say a stout man and a resolute swordsman  though  from what i have seen of his play he is weak in stoccado  and perhaps  somewhat too much attached to the edge  and doth not give prominence  enough to the point  in which respect he neglects the advice and  teaching of the most noteworthy fencers in europe  well  well  folk  differ on this as on every other subject  yet it seems to me that i  would sooner be carried off the field after using my weapon secundum  artem  than walk off unscathed after breaking the laws d escrime   quarte  tierce  and saccoon  say i  and the devil take your estramacons  and passados       but what of marot   i asked impatiently      he is aboard   said saxon   it appears that he was much disturbed in  his mind over the cruelties which were inflicted on the country folk  after the battle at bridgewater  being a man of a somewhat stern and  fierce turn of mind  his disapproval did vent itself in actions rather  than words  soldiers were found here and there over the countryside  pistolled or stabbed  and no trace left of their assailant  a dozen or  more were cut off in this way  and soon it came to be whispered about  that marot the highwayman was the man that did it  and the chase became  hot at his heels       well  and what then   i asked  for saxon had stopped to light his pipe  at the same old metal tinder box which he had used when first i met  him  when i picture saxon to myself it is usually of that moment that i  think  when the red glow beat upon his hard  eager  hawk like face  and  showed up the thousand little seams and wrinkles which time and care had  imprinted upon his brown  weather beaten skin  sometimes in my dreams  that face in the darkness comes back to me  and his half closed eyelids  and shifting  blinky eyes are turned towards me in his sidelong fashion   until i find myself sitting up and holding out my hand into empty space   half expecting to feel another thin sinewy hand close round it  a bad  man he was in many ways  my dears  cunning and wily  with little scruple  or conscience  and yet so strange a thing is human nature  and so  difficult is it for us to control our feelings  that my heart warms when  i think of him  and that fifty years have increased rather than weakened  the kindliness which i hear to him      i had heard   quoth he  puffing slowly at his pipe   that marot was a  man of this kidney  and also that he was so compassed round that he was  in peril of capture  i sought him out  therefore  and held council with  him  his mare  it seems  had been slain by some chance shot  and as he  was much attached to the brute  the accident made him more savage and  more dangerous than ever  he had no heart  he said  to continue in his  old trade  indeed  he was ripe for anything  the very stuff out of which  useful tools are made  i found that in his youth he had had a training  for the sea  when i heard that  i saw my way in the snap of a petronel       what then   i asked   i am still in the dark       nay  it is surely plain enough to you now  marot s end was to baffle  his pursuers and to benefit the exiles  how could he do this better than  by engaging as a seaman aboard this brig  the  dorothy fox   and sailing  away from england in her  there are but thirty of a crew  below hatches  are close on two hundred men  who  simple as they may be  are  as you  and i know  second to none in the cut and thrust work  without order or  discipline  which will be needed in such an affair  marot has but to go  down amongst them some dark night  knock off their anklets  and fit them  up with a few stanchions or cudgels  ho  ho  micah  what think you  the  planters may dig their plantations themselves for all the help they are  like to get from west countrymen this bout       it is  indeed  a well conceived plan   said i   it is a pity  saxon   that your ready wit and quick invention hath not had a fair field  you  are  us i know well  as fit to command armies and to order campaigns as  any man that ever bore a truncheon       mark ye there   whispered saxon  grasping me by the arm   see where  the moonlight falls beside the hatchway  do you not see that short squat  seaman who stands alone  lost in thought  with his head sunk upon his  breast  it is marot  i tell you that if i were captain pogram i would  rather have the devil himself  horns  hoofs  and tail  for my first  mate and bunk companion  than have that man aboard my ship  you need not  concern yourself about the prisoners  micah  their future is decided       then  saxon   i answered   it only remains for me to thank you  and to  accept the means of safety which you have placed within my reach       spoken like a man   said he   is there aught which i may do for thee in  england  though  by the mass  i may not be here very long myself  for   as i understand  i am to be entrusted with the command of an expedition  that is fitting out against the indians  who have ravaged the  plantations of our settlers  it will be good to get to some profitable  employment  for such a war  without either fighting or plunder  i have  never seen  i give you my word that i have scarce fingered silver since  the beginning of it  i would not for the sacking of london go through  with it again       there is a friend whom sir gervas jerome did commend to my care   i  remarked   i have  however  already taken measures to have his wishes  carried out  there is naught else save to assure all in havant that a  king who hath battened upon his subjects  as this one of ours hath done   is not one who is like to keep his seat very long upon the throne of  england  when he falls i shall return  and perhaps it may be sooner than  folk think       these doings in the west have indeed stirred up much ill feeling all  over the country   said my companion   on all hands i hear that there is  more hatred of the king and of his ministers than before the outbreak   what ho  captain pogram  this way  we have settled the matter  and my  friend is willing to go       i thought he would tack round   the captain said  staggering towards us  with a gait which showed that he had made the rum bottle his companion  since we had left him   s help me  i was sure of it  though  by the  mass  i don t wonder that he thought twice before leaving the  dorothy  fox   for she is fitted up fit for a duchess  s help me  where is your  boat       alongside   replied saxon   my friend joins with me in hoping that you   captain pogram  will have a pleasant and profitable voyage       i am cursedly beholden to him   said the captain  with a flourish of  his three cornered hat      also that you will reach barbadoes in safety       little doubt of that   quoth the captain      and that you will dispose of your wares in a manner which will repay  you for your charity and humanity       nay  these are handsome words   cried the captain   sir  i am your  debtor      a fishing boat was lying alongside the brig  by the murky light of the  poop lanterns i could see the figures upon her deck  and the great brown  sail all ready for hoisting  i climbed the bulwark and set my foot upon  the rope ladder which led down to her      good bye  decimus   said i      good bye  my lad  you have your pieces all safe       i have them       then i have one other present to make you  it was brought to me by a  sergeant of the royal horse  it is that  micah  on which you must now  depend for food  lodging  raiment  and all which you would have  it  is that to which a brave man can always look for his living  it is the  knife wherewith you can open the world s oyster  see  lad  it is your  sword       the old sword  my father s sword   i cried in delight  as saxon drew  from under his mantle and handed to me the discoloured  old fashioned  leathern sheath with the heavy brass hilt which i knew so well      you are now   said he   one of the old and honourable guild of soldiers  of fortune  while the turk is still snarling at the gates of vienna  there will ever be work for strong arms and brave hearts  you will find  that among these wandering  fighting men  drawn from all climes and  nations  the name of englishman stands high  well i know that it will  stand none the lower for your having joined the brotherhood  i would  that i could come with you  but i am promised pay and position which it  would be ill to set aside  farewell  lad  and may fortune go with you      i pressed the rough soldier s horny hand  and descended into the  fishing boat  the rope that held us was cast off  the sail mounted up   and the boat shot out across the bay  onward she went and on  through  the gathering gloom  a gloom as dark and impenetrable as the future  towards which my life s bark was driving  soon the long rise and fall  told us that we were over the harbour bar and out in the open channel   on the land  scattered twinkling lights at long stretches marked the  line of the coast  as i gazed backwards a cloud trailed off from the  moon  and i saw the hard lines of the brig s rigging stand out against  the white cold disk  by the shrouds stood the veteran  holding to a  rope with one hand  and waving the other in farewell and encouragement   another groat cloud blurred out the light  and that lean sinewy figure  with its long extended arm was the last which i saw for a weary time of  the dear country where i was born and bred         chapter xxxvi  of the end of it all    and so  my dear children  i come to the end of the history of a  failure  a brave failure and a noble one  but a failure none the less   in three more years england was to come to herself  to tear the fetters  from her free limbs  and to send james and his poisonous brood flying  from her shores even as i was flying then  we had made the error of  being before our time  yet there came days when folk thought kindly of  the lads who had fought so stoutly in the west  and when their limbs   gathered from many a hangman s pit and waste place  were borne amid the  silent sorrow of a nation to the pretty country burial grounds where  they would have chosen to lie  there  within the sound of the bell which  from infancy had called them to prayer  beneath the turf over which they  had wandered  under the shadow of those mendip and quantock hills which  they loved so well  these brave hearts lie still and peaceful  like  tired children in the bosom of their mother  requiescant requiescant in  pace     not another word about myself  dear children  this narrative doth  already bristle with i s  as though it were an argus which is a flash  of wit  though i doubt if ye will understand it  i set myself to tell ye  the tale of the war in the west  and that tale ye have heard  nor will  i be coaxed or cajoled into one word further  ah  ye know well how  garrulous the old man is  and that if you could but get to flushing with  him he would take ye to the wars of the empire  to william s court  and  to the second invasion of the west  which had a better outcome than the  first  but not an inch further will i budge  on to the green  ye young  rogues  have ye not other limbs to exercise besides your ears  that ye  should be so fond of squatting round grandad s chair  if i am spared to  next winter  and if the rheumatiz keeps away  it is like that i may take  up once more the broken thread of my story     of the others i can only tell ye what i know  some slipped out of my  ken entirely  of others i have heard vague and incomplete accounts   the leaders of the insurrection got off much more lightly than their  followers  for they found that the passion of greed was even stronger  than the passion of cruelty  grey  buyse  wade  and others bought  themselves free at the price of all their possessions  ferguson escaped   monmouth was executed on tower hill  and showed in his last moments  some faint traces of that spirit which spurted up now and again from his  feeble nature  like the momentary flash of an expiring fire     my father and my mother lived to see the protestant religion regain its  place once more  and to see england become the champion of the reformed  faith upon the continent  three years later i found them in havant much  as i had left them  save that there were more silver hairs amongst the  brown braided tresses of my mother  and that my father s great shoulders  were a trifle bowed and his brow furrowed with the lines of care  hand  in hand they passed onwards down life s journey  the puritan and the  church woman  and i have never despaired of the healing of religious  feud in england since i have seen how easy it is for two folks to retain  the strongest belief in their own creeds  and yet to bear the heartiest  love and respect for the professor of another  the days may come when  the church and the chapel may be as a younger and an elder brother   each working to one end  and each joying in the other s success  let  the contest between them be not with pike and pistol  not with court and  prison  but let the strife be which shall lead the higher life  which  shall take the broader view  which shall boast the happiest and best  cared for poor  then their rivalry shall be not a curse  but a blessing  to this land of england     reuben lockarby was ill for many months  but when he at last recovered  he found a pardon awaiting him through the interest of major ogilvy   after a time  when the troubles were all blown over  he married the  daughter of mayor timewell  and he still lives in taunton  a well to do  and prosperous citizen  thirty years ago there was a little micah  lockarby  and now i am told that there is another  the son of the first   who promises to be as arrant a little roundhead as ever marched to the  tuck of drum     of saxon i have heard more than once  so skilfully did he use his hold  over the duke of beaufort  that he was appointed through his interest to  the command of an expedition which had been sent to chastise the savages  of virginia  who had wrought great cruelties upon the settlers  there  he did so out ambush their ambushes  and out trick their most cunning  warriors  that he hath left a great name among them  and is still  remembered there by an indian word which signifieth  the long legged  wily one with the eye of a rat   having at last driven the tribes far  into the wilderness he was presented with a tract of country for his  services  where he settled down  there he married  and spent the rest of  his days in rearing tobacco and in teaching the principles of war to a  long line of gaunt and slab sided children  they tell me that a great  nation of exceeding strength and of wondrous size promises some day to  rise up on the other side of the water  if this should indeed come to  pass  it may perhaps happen that these young saxons or their children  may have a hand in the building of it  god grant that they may never  let their hearts harden to the little isle of the sea  which is and must  ever be the cradle of their race     solomon sprent married and lived for many years as happily as his  friends could wish  i had a letter from him when i was abroad  in which  he said that though his consort and he had started alone on the voyage  of wedlock  they were now accompanied by a jolly boat and a gig  one  winter s night when the snow was on the ground he sent down for my  father  who hurried up to his house  he found the old man sitting up in  bed  with his flask of rumbo within reach  his tobacco box beside him   and a great brown bible balanced against his updrawn knees  he was  breathing heavily  and was in sore distress      i ve strained a plank  and have nine feet in the well   said he   it  comes in quicker than i can put it out  in truth  friend  i have not  been seaworthy this many a day  and it is time that i was condemned and  broken up      my father shook his head sadly as he marked his dusky face and laboured  breathing   how of your soul   he asked      aye   said solomon   that s a cargo that we carry under our hatches   though we can t see it  and had no hand in the stowing of it  i ve been  overhauling the sailing orders here  and the ten articles of war  but i  can t find that i ve gone so far out of my course that i may not hope to  come into the channel again       trust not in yourself  but in christ   said my father      he is the pilot  in course   replied the old seaman   when i had a  pilot aboard o  my ship  however  it was my way always to keep my own  weather eye open  d ye see  and so i ll do now  the pilot don t think  none the worse of ye for it  so i ll throw my own lead line  though i  hear as how there are no soundings in the ocean of god s mercy  say   friend  d ye think this very body  this same hull o  mine  will rise  again       so we are taught   my father answered      i d know it anywhere from the tattoo marks   said solomon   they was  done when i was with sir christopher in the west indies  and i d be  sorry to part with them  for myself  d ye see  i ve never borne ill will  to any one  not even to the dutch lubbers  though i fought three wars  wi  them  and they carried off one of my spars  and be hanged to them   if i ve let daylight into a few of them  d ye see  it s all in good  part and by way of duty  i ve drunk my share  enough to sweeten my  bilge water  but there are few that have seen me cranky in the  upper rigging or refusing to answer to my helm  i never drew pay or  prize money that my mate in distress was not welcome to the half of it   as to the polls  the less said the better  i ve been a true consort  to my phoebe since she agreed to look to me for signals  those are my  papers  all clear and aboveboard  if i m summoned aft this very night by  the great lord high admiral of all  i ain t afeared that he ll clap me  into the bilboes  for though i m only a poor sailor man  i ve got his  promise in this here book  and i m not afraid of his going back from  it      my father sat with the old man for some hours and did all that he could  to comfort and assist him  for it was clear that he was sinking rapidly   when he at last left him  with his faithful wife beside him  he grasped  the brown but wasted hand which lay above the clothes      i ll see you again soon   he said      yes  in the latitude of heaven   replied the dying seaman  his  foreboding was right  for in the early hours of the morning his wife   bending over him  saw a bright smile upon his tanned  weather beaten  face  raising himself upon his pillow he touched his forelock  as is  the habit of sailor men  and so sank slowly and peacefully back into the  long sleep which wakes when the night has ceased to be     you will ask me doubtless what became of hector marot and of the strange  shipload which had set sail from poole harbour  there was never a word  heard of them again  unless indeed a story which was spread some months  afterwards by captain elias hopkins  of the bristol ship  caroline   may  be taken as bearing upon their fate  for captain hopkins relates that   being on his homeward voyage from our settlements  he chanced to meet  with thick fogs and a head wind in the neighbourhood of the great cod  banks  one night as he was beating about  with the weather so thick that  he could scarce see the truck of his own mast  a most strange passage  befell him  for as he and others stood upon the deck  they heard to  their astonishment the sound of many voices joined in a great chorus   which was at first faint and distant  but which presently waxed and  increased until it appeared to pass within a stone throw of his vessel   when it slowly died away once more and was lost in the distance  there  were some among the crew who set the matter down as the doing of the  evil one  but  as captain elias hopkins was wont to remark  it was a  strange thing that the foul fiend should choose west country hymns for  his nightly exercise  and stranger still that the dwellers in the pit  should sing with a strong somersetshire burr  for myself  i have little  doubt that it was indeed the  dorothy fox  which had swept past in the  fog  and that the prisoners  having won their freedom  were celebrating  their delivery in true puritan style  whether they were driven on to the  rocky coast of labrador  or whether they found a home in some desolate  land whence no kingly cruelty could harry them  is what must remain for  ever unknown     zachariah palmer lived for many years  a venerable and honoured old man   before he  too  was called to his fathers  a sweet and simple village  philosopher he was  with a child s heart in his aged breast  the very  thought of him is to me as the smell of violets  for if in my views of  life and in my hopes of the future i differ somewhat from the hard and  gloomy teaching of my father  i know that i owe it to the wise words  and kindly training of the carpenter  if  as he was himself wont to  say  deeds are everything in this world and dogma is nothing  then his  sinless  blameless life might be a pattern to you and to all  may the  dust lie light upon him     one word of another friend  the last mentioned  but not the least  valued  when dutch william had been ten years upon the english throne  there was still to be seen in the field by my father s house a tall   strong boned horse  whose grey skin was flecked with dashes of white   and it was ever observed that  should the soldiers be passing from  portsmouth  or should the clank of trumpet or the rattle of drum break  upon his ear  he would arch his old neck  throw out his grey streaked  tail  and raise his stiff knees in a pompous and pedantic canter  the  country folk would stop to watch these antics of the old horse  and then  the chances are that one of them would tell the rest how that charger  had borne one of their own village lads to the wars  and how  when the  rider had to fly the country  a kindly sergeant in the king s troops  had brought the steed as a remembrance of him to his father at home  so  covenant passed the last years of his life  a veteran among steeds  well  fed and cared for  and much given  mayhap  to telling in equine language  to all the poor  silly country steeds the wonderful passages which had  befallen him in the west         appendix      note a   hatred of learning among the puritans     in spite of the presence in their ranks of such ripe scholars as john  milton  colonel hutchinson  and others  there was among the independents  and anabaptists a profound distrust of learning  which is commented upon  by writers of all shades of politics  dr  south in his sermons remarks  that  all learning was cried down  so that with them the best preachers  were such as could not read  and the best divines such as could not  write  in all their preachments they so highly pretended to the spirit   that some of them could hardly spell a letter  to be blind with them was  a proper qualification of a spiritual guide  and to be book learned  as  they called it  and to be irreligious  were almost convertible terms   none save tradesmen and mechanics were allowed to have the spirit  and  those only were accounted like st  paul who could work with their hands   and were able to make a pulpit before preaching in it      in the collection of loyal ballads reprinted in       the royalist bard  harps upon the same characteristic                we ll down with universities              where learning is professed              because they practise and maintain              the language of the beast              we ll drive the doctors out of doors               and parts  whate er they be              we ll cry all parts and learning down               and heigh  then up go we        note b   on the speed of couriers     it is difficult for us in these days of steam and electricity to realise  how long it

referred to by the mayor of taunton in his allusion  to the drummer of tedsworth are probably too well known to require  elucidation  the haunting of the old gast house at burton would   however  be fresh at that time in the minds of somersetshire folk   occurring as it did in       some short account from documents of that  date may be of interest      the first night that i was there  with hugh mellmore and edward smith   they heard as it were the washing of water over their heads  then   taking the candle and going up the stairs  there was a wet cloth thrown  at them  but it fell on the stairs  they  going up further  there was  another thrown as before  and when they were come up into the chamber  there stood a bowl of water  looking white  as though soap had been used  in it  the bowl just before was in the kitchen  and could not be carried  up but through the room where they were  the next thing was a terrible  noise  like a clap of thunder  and shortly afterwards they heard a great  scratching about the bedstead  and after that great knocking with a  hammer against the bed s head  so that the two maids that were in bed  cried out for help  then they ran up the stairs  and there lay the  hammer on the bed  and on the bed s head there were near a thousand  prints of the hammer  the maids said that they were scratched and  pinched with a hand which had exceeding long nails      the second night that james sherring and thomas hillary were there   james sherring sat down in the chimney to fill a pipe of tobacco  he  used the tongs to lift a coal to light his pipe  and by and by the tongs  were drawn up the stairs and were cast upon the bed  the same night one  of the maids left her shoes by the fire  and they were carried up into  the chamber  and the old man s brought down and set in their places   as they were going upstairs there were many things thrown at them which  were just before in the low room  and when they went down the stairs the  old man s breeches were thrown down after them      on another night a saddle did come into the house from a pin in the  entry  and did hop about the place from table to table  it was very  troublesome to them  until they broke it into small pieces and threw  it out into the roadway  so for some weeks the haunting continued   with rappings  scratching  movements of heavy articles  and many other  strange things  as are attested by all who were in the village  until at  last they ceased as suddenly as they had begun        note g   monmouth s progress in the west     during his triumphal progress

this girl not being able to work  her  mother  desirous to have her daughter cured  sent to the chirurgeons for  help  who tampered with it for some time  but could do no good  she  went likewise ten or eleven miles to a seventh son  but all in vain  no  visible hopes remained  and she expected nothing but the grave      but now  in this the girl s great extremity  god  the great physician   dictates to her  then languishing in her miserable  hopeless condition   what course to take and what to do for a cure  which was to go and touch  the duke of monmouth  the girl told her mother that  if she could  but touch the duke she would be well  the mother reproved her for her  foolish conceit  but the girl did often persuade her mother to go to  lackington to the duke  who then lay with mr  speaks   certainly   said  she   i should be well if i could touch him   the mother slighted these  pressing requests  but the more she slighted and reproved  the more  earnest the girl was for it  a few days after  the girl having noticed  that sir john sydenham intended to treat the duke at white lodge in  henton park  this girl with many of her neighbours went to the said  park  she being there timely waited the duke s coming  when first she  observed the duke she pressed in among a crowd of people and caught  him by the hand  his glove being on  and she likewise having a glove to  cover her wounds  she not being herewith satisfied at the first attempt  of touching his glove only  but her mind was she must touch some part  of his bare skin  she  weighing his coming forth  intended a second  attempt  the poor girl  thus between hope and fear  waited his motion   on a sudden there was news of the duke s coming on  which she to be  prepared rent off her glove  that was clung to the sores  in such haste  that she broke her glove  and brought away not only the sores but the  skin  the duke s glove  as providence would have it  the upper part hung  down  so that his hand wrist was bare  she pressed on  and caught him  by the bare hand wrist with her running hand  crying   god bless your  highness   and the duke said  god bless you   the girl  not a little  transported at her good success  came and assured her friends that she  would now be well  she came home to her mother in great joy  and told  her that she had touched the duke s hand  the mother  hearing what she  had done  reproved her sharply for her boldness  asked how she durst  do such a thing  and threatened to beat her for it  she cried out   oh   mother  i shall be well again  and healed of my wounds   and as god  almighty would have it  to the wonder and admiration of all  the six  wounds were speedily dried up  the eye became perfectly well  and the  girl was in good health  all which has been discovered to us by the  mother and daughter  and by neighbours that know her      henry clark  minister  captain james bale   c  c  whoever doubts the  truth of this relation may see the original under the hands of the  persons mentioned at the amsterdam coffee house  bartholomew lane  royal  exchange      in spite of the uncouth verbiage of the old narrative  there is a touch  of human pathos about it which makes it worthy of reproduction       note h   monmouth s contention of legitimacy     sir patrick hume  relating a talk with monmouth before his expedition   says   i urged if he considered himself as lawful son of king charles   late deceased  he said he did  i asked him if he were able to make out  and prove the marriage of his mother to king charles  and whether he  intended to lay claim to the crown  he answered that he had been able  lately to prove the marriage  and if some persons are not lately dead   of which he would inform himself  he would yet be able to prove it   as for his claiming the crown  he intended not to do it unless it were  advised to be done by those who should concern themselves and join for  the delivery of the nations      it may be remarked that in monmouth s commission to be general  dated  april       he is styled  our most entirely beloved and natural son    again  in a commission for the government of hull  april       he is   our well beloved natural son        note i   dragooners and chargers     the dragoons  being really mounted infantry  were provided with very  inferior animals to the real cavalry  from a letter of cromwell s    squire correspondence   april           it will be seen that a  dragooner was worth twenty pieces  while a charger could not be obtained  under sixty     note j   battle of sedgemoor     a curious little sidelight upon the battle is afforded by the two  following letters exhibited to the royal archaeological institute by the  rev  c  w  bingham      to mrs  chaffin at chettle house       monday  about ye forenoon  july               my dearest creature   this morning about one o clock the rebbells fell  upon us whilest we were in our tents in king s sedgemoor  with their  whole army     we have killed and taken at least      of them  they are  fled into bridgewater  it is said that we have taken all their cannon   but sure it is that most are  if all be not  a coat with stars on  t is  taken    tis run through the back  by some  tis thought that the duke  rebbell had it on and is killed  but most doe think that a servant wore  it  i wish he were called  that the wars may be ended  it s thought  he ll never be able to make his men fight again  i thank god i am very  well without the least hurt  soe are our dorsetshire friends  prythee  let biddy know this by the first opportunity  i am thyne onely deare   tossey      bridgewater  july              we have totally routed the enemies of god and the king  and can t hear  of fifty men together of the whole rebel army  we pick them up every  houre in cornfields and ditches  williams  the late duke s valet de  chambre  is taken  who gives a very ingenious account of the whole  affair  which is too long to write  the last word that he said to him  was at the time when his army fled  that he was undone and must shift  for himself  we think to march with the general this day to wells  on  his way homeward  at present he is   miles off at the camp  soe i can t  certainly tell whether he intends for wells  i shall be home certainly  on saturday at farthest  i believe my deare nan would for     pounds  that her tossey had served the king to the end of the war     i am thyne  my deare childe  for ever        note k   lord grey and the horse at sedgemoor     it is only fair to state that ferguson is held by many to have been  as doughty a soldier as he was zealous in religion  his own account of  sedgemoor is interesting  as showing what was thought by those who were  actually engaged on the causes of their failure      now besides these two troops  whose officers though they had no great  skill yet had courage enough to have done something honourably  had they  not for want of a guide met with the aforesaid obstruction  there was  no one of all the rest of our troops that ever advanced to charge or  approached as near to the enemy as to give or receive a wound  mr   hacker  one of our captains  came no sooner within view of their camp  than he villainously fired a pistol to give them notice of our approach   and then forsook his charge and rode oft with all the speed he could  to  take the benefit of a proclamation emitted by the king  offering pardon  to all such as should return home within such a time  and this he  pleaded at his tryal  but was answered by jeffreys  that he above all  other men deserved to be hanged  and that for his treachery to monmouth  as well as his treason to the king   and though no other of our officers  acted so villainously  yet they were useless and unserviceable  as never  once attempting to charge  nor so much as keeping their men in a body   and i dare affirm that if our horse had never fired a pistol  but only  stood in a posture to have given jealousy and apprehension to the enemy   our foot alone would have carried the day and been triumphant  but our  horse standing scattered and disunited  and flying upon every approach  of a squadron of theirs  commanded by oglethorpe  gave that body of  their cavalry an advantage  after they had hovered up and down in the  field without thinking it necessary to attack those whom their own fears  had dispersed  to fall in at last in the rear of our battalions  and to  wrest that victory out of their hands which they were grasping at  and  stood almost possessed of  nor was that party of their horse above  three hundred at most  whereas we had more than enough had they had any  courage  and been commanded by a gallant man  to have attacked them  with ease both in front and flank  these things i can declare with  more certainty  because i was a doleful spectator of them  for having  contrary to my custom left attending upon the duke  who advanced with  the foot  i betook myself to the horse  because the first of that  morning s action was expected from them  which was to break in and  disorder the enemy s camp  against the time that our battalions should  come up  i endeavoured whatsoever i was capable of performing  for i  not only struck at several troopers who had forsaken their station  but  upbraided divers of the captains for being wanting in their duty  but i  spoke with great warmth to my lord grey  and conjured him to charge  and  not suffer the victory  which our foot had in a manner taken hold of   to be ravished from us  but instead of hearkening  he not only as an  unworthy man and cowardly poltroon deserted that part of the field and  forsook his command  but rode with the utmost speed to the duke  telling  him that all was lost and it was more than time to shift for himself   wherebye  as an addition to all the mischief he had been the occasion  of before  he drew the easy and unfortunate gentleman to leave the  battalions while they were courageously disputing on which side the  victory should fall  and this fell most unhappily out  while a certain  person was endeavouring to find out the duke to have begged of him to  come and charge at the head of his own troops  however  this i dare  affirm  that if the duke had been but master of two hundred horse   well mounted  completely armed  personally valiant  and commanded  by experienced officers  they would have been victorious  this is  acknowledged by our enemies  who have often confessed they were ready  to fly through the impressions made upon them by our foot  and must have  been beaten had our horse done their part  and not tamely looked on  till their cavalry retrieved the day by falling into the rear of our  battalions  nor was the fault in the private men  who had courage  to have followed their leaders  but it was in those who led them   particularly my lord grey  in whom  if cowardice may be called  treachery  we may safely charge him with betraying our cause      extract from ms  of dr  ferguson  quoted in  ferguson the plotter   an  interesting work by his immediate descendant  an advocate of edinburgh       note l   monmouth s attitude after capture     the following letter  written by monmouth to the queen from the tower   is indicative of his abject state of mind      madam   i would not take the boldness of writing to your majesty till  i had shown the king how i do abhor the thing that i have done  and how  much i desire to live to serve him  i hope  madam  by what i have said  to the king to day will satisfy how sincere i am  and how much i detest  all those people who have brought me to this  having done this  madam   i thought i was in a fitt condition to beg your intercession  which i am  sure you never refuse to the distressed  and i am sure  madam  that i  am an object of your pity  having been cousened and cheated into this  horrid business  did i wish  madam  to live for living sake i would  never give you this trouble  but it is to have life to serve the  king  which i am able to doe  and will doe beyond what i can express   therefore  madam  upon such an account as i may take the boldness to  press you and beg of you to intersaid for me  for i am sure  madam  the  king will hearken to you  your prairs can never be refused  especially  when it is begging for a life only to serve the king  i hope  madam  by  the king s generosity and goodness  and your intercession  i may hope  for my life which if i have shall be ever employed in showing to your  majesty all the sense immaginable of gratitude  and in serving of the  king like a true subject  and ever be your majesty s most dutiful and  obedient servant  monmouth      the end
