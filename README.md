This Repository is about Idea 14, from NEW IDEAS (Current end of document).

I have problem in using BOOK CORPUS Due to its large size that can't fit into my computer memory.

I choose books because its THE most severe test to my hypothesis, since they are edited multiple times,
And in regular text like emails, the results will be much stronger.

Problem how to wheight more frequent words,
from one side if it more frequent it more important to us its distribution because it gonna to appear a lot,
But from the other side, if its very frequent,
its bigram will probably say nothing, so it
doesn't matter her distribution.
For now its un weighted.
